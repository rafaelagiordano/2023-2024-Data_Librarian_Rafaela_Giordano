These changes, often associated with the old concept of fidelity to the novel, characterize Portuguese Literature, like Universal Literature, since the beginning of the history of cinema that saw in literature a source of narratives and themes that, even today, remains the main source for world cinematography. In this complex process between the literary narrative and the film narrative, of course, participate the intentions of the director and the birth of a new work of art, the film, which must be seen as an independent art form, although we cannot forget the links that you have to the original text.

It was developed to process texts written in Portuguese, however it is potentially applicable to other languages as well. We compare our approach with current alternatives that support Named Entity Recognition (NER) for content written in Portuguese. These are Alchemy, Zemanta and Rembrandt.

The argument is exemplified by the empirical case of the fifteenth and sixteenth century Portuguese expansion and the reconstruction of the navigational context undertaken by the Portuguese in order to secure the global mobility and durability of their vessels. It is also suggested that three classes of emissaries - documents, devices and drilled people - have, together and separately, been particularly important for long distance control, and that the dominance of the West since the sixteenth century may be partly explained in terms of crucial innovations in the methods by which passive agents of these three types are produced and interrelated.

In human computation systems, the processors performing the computations are humans rather than machines. The effectiveness of this kind of system relies on its ability to optimize the use of the cognitive power provided by each human processor. However, little is known about how humans provide their cognitive power in these systems and how these systems can use such cognitive power properly. This study aims at advancing knowledge in this direction. To guide this study, we articulate a framework of theories and concepts about human computation, human engagement, human credibility, and the optimization of computational systems. Based on this theoretical-conceptual framework, we propose metrics to characterize the cognitive power available in a human computation system in terms of the engagement and the credibility of the participants. As case study of system optimization, we also propose a task replication algorithm that optimizes the use of the available cognitive power taking into account information about the credibility of participants. By using correlations, regressions, and clustering algorithms, we characterize the engagement and credibility of participants in data collected from six real systems. Several behavioral patterns are identified in such characterization. Participants can be divided into two broad classes of engagement: the transients, those who work in the system in just one day; and the regulars, those who exhibit a more lasting engagement. Regulars are the minority of participants, but they aggregate the larger amount of cognitive power to the system. They can be subdivided into five groups, labeled as: hardworking, spasmodic, persistent, lasting and moderate. The credibility of participants can be measured by using several different metrics based on the level of agreement among them. Regardless of the metric used, the credibility is negatively correlated with the degree of difficulty of the tasks. Results from simulation show that the proposed task replication algorithm can improve the ability of the system to properly use the cognitive power provided by participants. It also allows one to address trade-offs between different quality-of-service requirements.","","participation, crowdsourcing, engagement, human, computation","",""
