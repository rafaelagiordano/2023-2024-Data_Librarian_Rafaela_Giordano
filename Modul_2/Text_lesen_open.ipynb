PATRICK’S, DUBLIN.\\n\\n                      [_First published in_ 1726–7.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE PUBLISHER TO THE READER.\\n\\n\\n                  [_As given in the original edition_.]\\n\\nThe author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient and\\nintimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us on the\\nmother’s side.  About three years ago, Mr. Gulliver growing weary of the\\nconcourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff, made a\\nsmall purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark, in\\nNottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet in\\ngood esteem among his neighbours.\\n\\nAlthough Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his father\\ndwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from Oxfordshire; to\\nconfirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at Banbury in that\\ncounty, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.\\n\\nBefore he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following papers in\\nmy hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should think fit.  I\\nhave carefully perused them three times.  The style is very plain and\\nsimple; and the only fault I find is, that the author, after the manner\\nof travellers, is a little too circumstantial.  There is an air of truth\\napparent through the whole; and indeed the author was so distinguished\\nfor his veracity, that it became a sort of proverb among his neighbours\\nat Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing, to say, it was as true as if\\nMr. Gulliver had spoken it.\\n\\nBy the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the author’s\\npermission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to send them into\\nthe world, hoping they may be, at least for some time, a better\\nentertainment to our young noblemen, than the common scribbles of\\npolitics and party.\\n\\nThis volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not made\\nbold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and tides,\\nas well as to the variations and bearings in the several voyages,\\ntogether with the minute descriptions of the management of the ship in\\nstorms, in the style of sailors; likewise the account of longitudes and\\nlatitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend, that Mr. Gulliver may be a\\nlittle dissatisfied.  But I was resolved to fit the work as much as\\npossible to the general capacity of readers.  However, if my own\\nignorance in sea affairs shall have led me to commit some mistakes, I\\nalone am answerable for them.  And if any traveller hath a curiosity to\\nsee the whole work at large, as it came from the hands of the author, I\\nwill be ready to gratify him.\\n\\nAs for any further particulars relating to the author, the reader will\\nreceive satisfaction from the first pages of the book.\\n\\n                                                          RICHARD SYMPSON.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA LETTER FROM CAPTAIN GULLIVER TO HIS COUSIN SYMPSON.\\n\\n\\n                        WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1727.\\n\\nI hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be called to\\nit, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on me to\\npublish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels, with directions\\nto hire some young gentleman of either university to put them in order,\\nand correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did, by my advice, in his\\nbook called “A Voyage round the world.”  But I do not remember I gave you\\npower to consent that any thing should be omitted, and much less that any\\nthing should be inserted; therefore, as to the latter, I do here renounce\\nevery thing of that kind; particularly a paragraph about her majesty\\nQueen Anne, of most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence\\nand esteem her more than any of human species.  But you, or your\\ninterpolator, ought to have considered, that it was not my inclination,\\nso was it not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my\\nmaster _Houyhnhnm_: And besides, the fact was altogether false; for to my\\nknowledge, being in England during some part of her majesty’s reign, she\\ndid govern by a chief minister; nay even by two successively, the first\\nwhereof was the lord of Godolphin, and the second the lord of Oxford; so\\nthat you have made me say the thing that was not.  Likewise in the\\naccount of the academy of projectors, and several passages of my\\ndiscourse to my master _Houyhnhnm_, you have either omitted some material\\ncircumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner, that I do\\nhardly know my own work.  When I formerly hinted to you something of this\\nin a letter, you were pleased to answer that you were afraid of giving\\noffence; that people in power were very watchful over the press, and apt\\nnot only to interpret, but to punish every thing which looked like an\\n_innuendo_ (as I think you call it).  But, pray how could that which I\\nspoke so many years ago, and at about five thousand leagues distance, in\\nanother reign, be applied to any of the _Yahoos_, who now are said to\\ngovern the herd; especially at a time when I little thought, or feared,\\nthe unhappiness of living under them?  Have not I the most reason to\\ncomplain, when I see these very _Yahoos_ carried by _Houyhnhnms_ in a\\nvehicle, as if they were brutes, and those the rational creatures?  And\\nindeed to avoid so monstrous and detestable a sight was one principal\\nmotive of my retirement hither.\\n\\nThus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself, and to\\nthe trust I reposed in you.\\n\\nI do, in the next place, complain of my own great want of judgment, in\\nbeing prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasoning of you and\\nsome others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my travels to be\\npublished.  Pray bring to your mind how often I desired you to consider,\\nwhen you insisted on the motive of public good, that the _Yahoos_ were a\\nspecies of animals utterly incapable of amendment by precept or example:\\nand so it has proved; for, instead of seeing a full stop put to all\\nabuses and corruptions, at least in this little island, as I had reason\\nto expect; behold, after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my\\nbook has produced one single effect according to my intentions.  I\\ndesired you would let me know, by a letter, when party and faction were\\nextinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and modest,\\nwith some tincture of common sense, and Smithfield blazing with pyramids\\nof law books; the young nobility’s education entirely changed; the\\nphysicians banished; the female _Yahoos_ abounding in virtue, honour,\\ntruth, and good sense; courts and levees of great ministers thoroughly\\nweeded and swept; wit, merit, and learning rewarded; all disgracers of\\nthe press in prose and verse condemned to eat nothing but their own\\ncotton, and quench their thirst with their own ink.  These, and a\\nthousand other reformations, I firmly counted upon by your encouragement;\\nas indeed they were plainly deducible from the precepts delivered in my\\nbook.  And it must be owned, that seven months were a sufficient time to\\ncorrect every vice and folly to which _Yahoos_ are subject, if their\\nnatures had been capable of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom.\\nYet, so far have you been from answering my expectation in any of your\\nletters; that on the contrary you are loading our carrier every week with\\nlibels, and keys, and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein\\nI see myself accused of reflecting upon great state folk; of degrading\\nhuman nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of\\nabusing the female sex.  I find likewise that the writers of those\\nbundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not allow\\nme to be the author of my own travels; and others make me author of books\\nto which I am wholly a stranger.\\n\\nI find likewise that your printer has been so careless as to confound the\\ntimes, and mistake the dates, of my several voyages and returns; neither\\nassigning the true year, nor the true month, nor day of the month: and I\\nhear the original manuscript is all destroyed since the publication of my\\nbook; neither have I any copy left: however, I have sent you some\\ncorrections, which you may insert, if ever there should be a second\\nedition: and yet I cannot stand to them; but shall leave that matter to\\nmy judicious and candid readers to adjust it as they please.\\n\\nI hear some of our sea _Yahoos_ find fault with my sea-language, as not\\nproper in many parts, nor now in use.  I cannot help it.  In my first\\nvoyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest mariners, and\\nlearned to speak as they did.  But I have since found that the sea\\n_Yahoos_ are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled in their\\nwords, which the latter change every year; insomuch, as I remember upon\\neach return to my own country their old dialect was so altered, that I\\ncould hardly understand the new.  And I observe, when any _Yahoo_ comes\\nfrom London out of curiosity to visit me at my house, we neither of us\\nare able to deliver our conceptions in a manner intelligible to the\\nother.\\n\\nIf the censure of the _Yahoos_ could any way affect me, I should have\\ngreat reason to complain, that some of them are so bold as to think my\\nbook of travels a mere fiction out of mine own brain, and have gone so\\nfar as to drop hints, that the _Houyhnhnms_ and _Yahoos_ have no more\\nexistence than the inhabitants of Utopia.\\n\\nIndeed I must confess, that as to the people of _Lilliput_, _Brobdingrag_\\n(for so the word should have been spelt, and not erroneously\\n_Brobdingnag_), and _Laputa_, I have never yet heard of any _Yahoo_ so\\npresumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have related\\nconcerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every reader with\\nconviction.  And is there less probability in my account of the\\n_Houyhnhnms_ or _Yahoos_, when it is manifest as to the latter, there are\\nso many thousands even in this country, who only differ from their\\nbrother brutes in _Houyhnhnmland_, because they use a sort of jabber, and\\ndo not go naked?  I wrote for their amendment, and not their approbation.\\nThe united praise of the whole race would be of less consequence to me,\\nthan the neighing of those two degenerate _Houyhnhnms_ I keep in my\\nstable; because from these, degenerate as they are, I still improve in\\nsome virtues without any mixture of vice.\\n\\nDo these miserable animals presume to think, that I am so degenerated as\\nto defend my veracity?  _Yahoo_ as I am, it is well known through all\\n_Houyhnhnmland_, that, by the instructions and example of my illustrious\\nmaster, I was able in the compass of two years (although I confess with\\nthe utmost difficulty) to remove that infernal habit of lying, shuffling,\\ndeceiving, and equivocating, so deeply rooted in the very souls of all my\\nspecies; especially the Europeans.\\n\\nI have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but I\\nforbear troubling myself or you any further.  I must freely confess, that\\nsince my last return, some corruptions of my _Yahoo_ nature have revived\\nin me by conversing with a few of your species, and particularly those of\\nmy own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else I should never have\\nattempted so absurd a project as that of reforming the _Yahoo_ race in\\nthis kingdom: But I have now done with all such visionary schemes for\\never.\\n\\n_April_ 2, 1727\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART I.  A VOYAGE TO LILLIPUT.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\n\\n\\nThe author gives some account of himself and family.  His first\\ninducements to travel.  He is shipwrecked, and swims for his life.  Gets\\nsafe on shore in the country of Lilliput; is made a prisoner, and carried\\nup the country.\\n\\nMy father had a small estate in Nottinghamshire: I was the third of five\\nsons.  He sent me to Emanuel College in Cambridge at fourteen years old,\\nwhere I resided three years, and applied myself close to my studies; but\\nthe charge of maintaining me, although I had a very scanty allowance,\\nbeing too great for a narrow fortune, I was bound apprentice to Mr. James\\nBates, an eminent surgeon in London, with whom I continued four years.\\nMy father now and then sending me small sums of money, I laid them out in\\nlearning navigation, and other parts of the mathematics, useful to those\\nwho intend to travel, as I always believed it would be, some time or\\nother, my fortune to do.  When I left Mr. Bates, I went down to my\\nfather: where, by the assistance of him and my uncle John, and some other\\nrelations, I got forty pounds, and a promise of thirty pounds a year to\\nmaintain me at Leyden: there I studied physic two years and seven months,\\nknowing it would be useful in long voyages.\\n\\nSoon after my return from Leyden, I was recommended by my good master,\\nMr. Bates, to be surgeon to the Swallow, Captain Abraham Pannel,\\ncommander; with whom I continued three years and a half, making a voyage\\nor two into the Levant, and some other parts.  When I came back I\\nresolved to settle in London; to which Mr. Bates, my master, encouraged\\nme, and by him I was recommended to several patients.  I took part of a\\nsmall house in the Old Jewry; and being advised to alter my condition, I\\nmarried Mrs. Mary Burton, second daughter to Mr. Edmund Burton, hosier,\\nin Newgate-street, with whom I received four hundred pounds for a\\nportion.\\n\\nBut my good master Bates dying in two years after, and I having few\\nfriends, my business began to fail; for my conscience would not suffer me\\nto imitate the bad practice of too many among my brethren.  Having\\ntherefore consulted with my wife, and some of my acquaintance, I\\ndetermined to go again to sea.  I was surgeon successively in two ships,\\nand made several voyages, for six years, to the East and West Indies, by\\nwhich I got some addition to my fortune.  My hours of leisure I spent in\\nreading the best authors, ancient and modern, being always provided with\\na good number of books; and when I was ashore, in observing the manners\\nand dispositions of the people, as well as learning their language;\\nwherein I had a great facility, by the strength of my memory.\\n\\nThe last of these voyages not proving very fortunate, I grew weary of the\\nsea, and intended to stay at home with my wife and family.  I removed\\nfrom the Old Jewry to Fetter Lane, and from thence to Wapping, hoping to\\nget business among the sailors; but it would not turn to account.  After\\nthree years expectation that things would mend, I accepted an\\nadvantageous offer from Captain William Prichard, master of the Antelope,\\nwho was making a voyage to the South Sea.  We set sail from Bristol, May\\n4, 1699, and our voyage was at first very prosperous.\\n\\nIt would not be proper, for some reasons, to trouble the reader with the\\nparticulars of our adventures in those seas; let it suffice to inform\\nhim, that in our passage from thence to the East Indies, we were driven\\nby a violent storm to the north-west of Van Diemen’s Land.  By an\\nobservation, we found ourselves in the latitude of 30 degrees 2 minutes\\nsouth.  Twelve of our crew were dead by immoderate labour and ill food;\\nthe rest were in a very weak condition.  On the 5th of November, which\\nwas the beginning of summer in those parts, the weather being very hazy,\\nthe seamen spied a rock within half a cable’s length of the ship; but the\\nwind was so strong, that we were driven directly upon it, and immediately\\nsplit.  Six of the crew, of whom I was one, having let down the boat into\\nthe sea, made a shift to get clear of the ship and the rock.  We rowed,\\nby my computation, about three leagues, till we were able to work no\\nlonger, being already spent with labour while we were in the ship.  We\\ntherefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves, and in about half\\nan hour the boat was overset by a sudden flurry from the north.  What\\nbecame of my companions in the boat, as well as of those who escaped on\\nthe rock, or were left in the vessel, I cannot tell; but conclude they\\nwere all lost.  For my own part, I swam as fortune directed me, and was\\npushed forward by wind and tide.  I often let my legs drop, and could\\nfeel no bottom; but when I was almost gone, and able to struggle no\\nlonger, I found myself within my depth; and by this time the storm was\\nmuch abated.  The declivity was so small, that I walked near a mile\\nbefore I got to the shore, which I conjectured was about eight o’clock in\\nthe evening.  I then advanced forward near half a mile, but could not\\ndiscover any sign of houses or inhabitants; at least I was in so weak a\\ncondition, that I did not observe them.  I was extremely tired, and with\\nthat, and the heat of the weather, and about half a pint of brandy that I\\ndrank as I left the ship, I found myself much inclined to sleep.  I lay\\ndown on the grass, which was very short and soft, where I slept sounder\\nthan ever I remembered to have done in my life, and, as I reckoned, about\\nnine hours; for when I awaked, it was just day-light.  I attempted to\\nrise, but was not able to stir: for, as I happened to lie on my back, I\\nfound my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to the ground;\\nand my hair, which was long and thick, tied down in the same manner.  I\\nlikewise felt several slender ligatures across my body, from my arm-pits\\nto my thighs.  I could only look upwards; the sun began to grow hot, and\\nthe light offended my eyes.  I heard a confused noise about me; but in\\nthe posture I lay, could see nothing except the sky.  In a little time I\\nfelt something alive moving on my left leg, which advancing gently\\nforward over my breast, came almost up to my chin; when, bending my eyes\\ndownwards as much as I could, I perceived it to be a human creature not\\nsix inches high, with a bow and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his\\nback.  In the mean time, I felt at least forty more of the same kind (as\\nI conjectured) following the first.  I was in the utmost astonishment,\\nand roared so loud, that they all ran back in a fright; and some of them,\\nas I was afterwards told, were hurt with the falls they got by leaping\\nfrom my sides upon the ground.  However, they soon returned, and one of\\nthem, who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face, lifting up\\nhis hands and eyes by way of admiration, cried out in a shrill but\\ndistinct voice, _Hekinah degul_: the others repeated the same words\\nseveral times, but then I knew not what they meant.  I lay all this\\nwhile, as the reader may believe, in great uneasiness.  At length,\\nstruggling to get loose, I had the fortune to break the strings, and\\nwrench out the pegs that fastened my left arm to the ground; for, by\\nlifting it up to my face, I discovered the methods they had taken to bind\\nme, and at the same time with a violent pull, which gave me excessive\\npain, I a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair on the left\\nside, so that I was just able to turn my head about two inches.  But the\\ncreatures ran off a second time, before I could seize them; whereupon\\nthere was a great shout in a very shrill accent, and after it ceased I\\nheard one of them cry aloud _Tolgo phonac_; when in an instant I felt\\nabove a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand, which, pricked me like\\nso many needles; and besides, they shot another flight into the air, as\\nwe do bombs in Europe, whereof many, I suppose, fell on my body, (though\\nI felt them not), and some on my face, which I immediately covered with\\nmy left hand.  When this shower of arrows was over, I fell a groaning\\nwith grief and pain; and then striving again to get loose, they\\ndischarged another volley larger than the first, and some of them\\nattempted with spears to stick me in the sides; but by good luck I had on\\na buff jerkin, which they could not pierce.  I thought it the most\\nprudent method to lie still, and my design was to continue so till night,\\nwhen, my left hand being already loose, I could easily free myself: and\\nas for the inhabitants, I had reason to believe I might be a match for\\nthe greatest army they could bring against me, if they were all of the\\nsame size with him that I saw.  But fortune disposed otherwise of me.\\nWhen the people observed I was quiet, they discharged no more arrows;\\nbut, by the noise I heard, I knew their numbers increased; and about four\\nyards from me, over against my right ear, I heard a knocking for above an\\nhour, like that of people at work; when turning my head that way, as well\\nas the pegs and strings would permit me, I saw a stage erected about a\\nfoot and a half from the ground, capable of holding four of the\\ninhabitants, with two or three ladders to mount it: from whence one of\\nthem, who seemed to be a person of quality, made me a long speech,\\nwhereof I understood not one syllable.  But I should have mentioned, that\\nbefore the principal person began his oration, he cried out three times,\\n_Langro dehul san_ (these words and the former were afterwards repeated\\nand explained to me); whereupon, immediately, about fifty of the\\ninhabitants came and cut the strings that fastened the left side of my\\nhead, which gave me the liberty of turning it to the right, and of\\nobserving the person and gesture of him that was to speak.  He appeared\\nto be of a middle age, and taller than any of the other three who\\nattended him, whereof one was a page that held up his train, and seemed\\nto be somewhat longer than my middle finger; the other two stood one on\\neach side to support him.  He acted every part of an orator, and I could\\nobserve many periods of threatenings, and others of promises, pity, and\\nkindness.  I answered in a few words, but in the most submissive manner,\\nlifting up my left hand, and both my eyes to the sun, as calling him for\\na witness; and being almost famished with hunger, having not eaten a\\nmorsel for some hours before I left the ship, I found the demands of\\nnature so strong upon me, that I could not forbear showing my impatience\\n(perhaps against the strict rules of decency) by putting my finger\\nfrequently to my mouth, to signify that I wanted food.  The _hurgo_ (for\\nso they call a great lord, as I afterwards learnt) understood me very\\nwell.  He descended from the stage, and commanded that several ladders\\nshould be applied to my sides, on which above a hundred of the\\ninhabitants mounted and walked towards my mouth, laden with baskets full\\nof meat, which had been provided and sent thither by the king’s orders,\\nupon the first intelligence he received of me.  I observed there was the\\nflesh of several animals, but could not distinguish them by the taste.\\nThere were shoulders, legs, and loins, shaped like those of mutton, and\\nvery well dressed, but smaller than the wings of a lark.  I ate them by\\ntwo or three at a mouthful, and took three loaves at a time, about the\\nbigness of musket bullets.  They supplied me as fast as they could,\\nshowing a thousand marks of wonder and astonishment at my bulk and\\nappetite.  I then made another sign, that I wanted drink.  They found by\\nmy eating that a small quantity would not suffice me; and being a most\\ningenious people, they slung up, with great dexterity, one of their\\nlargest hogsheads, then rolled it towards my hand, and beat out the top;\\nI drank it off at a draught, which I might well do, for it did not hold\\nhalf a pint, and tasted like a small wine of Burgundy, but much more\\ndelicious.  They brought me a second hogshead, which I drank in the same\\nmanner, and made signs for more; but they had none to give me.  When I\\nhad performed these wonders, they shouted for joy, and danced upon my\\nbreast, repeating several times as they did at first, _Hekinah degul_.\\nThey made me a sign that I should throw down the two hogsheads, but first\\nwarning the people below to stand out of the way, crying aloud, _Borach\\nmevolah_; and when they saw the vessels in the air, there was a universal\\nshout of _Hekinah degul_.  I confess I was often tempted, while they were\\npassing backwards and forwards on my body, to seize forty or fifty of the\\nfirst that came in my reach, and dash them against the ground.  But the\\nremembrance of what I had felt, which probably might not be the worst\\nthey could do, and the promise of honour I made them—for so I interpreted\\nmy submissive behaviour—soon drove out these imaginations.  Besides, I\\nnow considered myself as bound by the laws of hospitality, to a people\\nwho had treated me with so much expense and magnificence.  However, in my\\nthoughts I could not sufficiently wonder at the intrepidity of these\\ndiminutive mortals, who durst venture to mount and walk upon my body,\\nwhile one of my hands was at liberty, without trembling at the very sight\\nof so prodigious a creature as I must appear to them.  After some time,\\nwhen they observed that I made no more demands for meat, there appeared\\nbefore me a person of high rank from his imperial majesty.  His\\nexcellency, having mounted on the small of my right leg, advanced\\nforwards up to my face, with about a dozen of his retinue; and producing\\nhis credentials under the signet royal, which he applied close to my\\neyes, spoke about ten minutes without any signs of anger, but with a kind\\nof determinate resolution, often pointing forwards, which, as I\\nafterwards found, was towards the capital city, about half a mile\\ndistant; whither it was agreed by his majesty in council that I must be\\nconveyed.  I answered in few words, but to no purpose, and made a sign\\nwith my hand that was loose, putting it to the other (but over his\\nexcellency’s head for fear of hurting him or his train) and then to my\\nown head and body, to signify that I desired my liberty.  It appeared\\nthat he understood me well enough, for he shook his head by way of\\ndisapprobation, and held his hand in a posture to show that I must be\\ncarried as a prisoner.  However, he made other signs to let me understand\\nthat I should have meat and drink enough, and very good treatment.\\nWhereupon I once more thought of attempting to break my bonds; but again,\\nwhen I felt the smart of their arrows upon my face and hands, which were\\nall in blisters, and many of the darts still sticking in them, and\\nobserving likewise that the number of my enemies increased, I gave tokens\\nto let them know that they might do with me what they pleased.  Upon\\nthis, the _hurgo_ and his train withdrew, with much civility and cheerful\\ncountenances.  Soon after I heard a general shout, with frequent\\nrepetitions of the words _Peplom selan_; and I felt great numbers of\\npeople on my left side relaxing the cords to such a degree, that I was\\nable to turn upon my right, and to ease myself with making water; which I\\nvery plentifully did, to the great astonishment of the people; who,\\nconjecturing by my motion what I was going to do, immediately opened to\\nthe right and left on that side, to avoid the torrent, which fell with\\nsuch noise and violence from me.  But before this, they had daubed my\\nface and both my hands with a sort of ointment, very pleasant to the\\nsmell, which, in a few minutes, removed all the smart of their arrows.\\nThese circumstances, added to the refreshment I had received by their\\nvictuals and drink, which were very nourishing, disposed me to sleep.  I\\nslept about eight hours, as I was afterwards assured; and it was no\\nwonder, for the physicians, by the emperor’s order, had mingled a sleepy\\npotion in the hogsheads of wine.\\n\\nIt seems, that upon the first moment I was discovered sleeping on the\\nground, after my landing, the emperor had early notice of it by an\\nexpress; and determined in council, that I should be tied in the manner I\\nhave related, (which was done in the night while I slept;) that plenty of\\nmeat and drink should be sent to me, and a machine prepared to carry me\\nto the capital city.\\n\\nThis resolution perhaps may appear very bold and dangerous, and I am\\nconfident would not be imitated by any prince in Europe on the like\\noccasion.  However, in my opinion, it was extremely prudent, as well as\\ngenerous: for, supposing these people had endeavoured to kill me with\\ntheir spears and arrows, while I was asleep, I should certainly have\\nawaked with the first sense of smart, which might so far have roused my\\nrage and strength, as to have enabled me to break the strings wherewith I\\nwas tied; after which, as they were not able to make resistance, so they\\ncould expect no mercy.\\n\\nThese people are most excellent mathematicians, and arrived to a great\\nperfection in mechanics, by the countenance and encouragement of the\\nemperor, who is a renowned patron of learning.  This prince has several\\nmachines fixed on wheels, for the carriage of trees and other great\\nweights.  He often builds his largest men of war, whereof some are nine\\nfeet long, in the woods where the timber grows, and has them carried on\\nthese engines three or four hundred yards to the sea.  Five hundred\\ncarpenters and engineers were immediately set at work to prepare the\\ngreatest engine they had.  It was a frame of wood raised three inches\\nfrom the ground, about seven feet long, and four wide, moving upon\\ntwenty-two wheels.  The shout I heard was upon the arrival of this\\nengine, which, it seems, set out in four hours after my landing.  It was\\nbrought parallel to me, as I lay.  But the principal difficulty was to\\nraise and place me in this vehicle.  Eighty poles, each of one foot high,\\nwere erected for this purpose, and very strong cords, of the bigness of\\npackthread, were fastened by hooks to many bandages, which the workmen\\nhad girt round my neck, my hands, my body, and my legs.  Nine hundred of\\nthe strongest men were employed to draw up these cords, by many pulleys\\nfastened on the poles; and thus, in less than three hours, I was raised\\nand slung into the engine, and there tied fast.  All this I was told;\\nfor, while the operation was performing, I lay in a profound sleep, by\\nthe force of that soporiferous medicine infused into my liquor.  Fifteen\\nhundred of the emperor’s largest horses, each about four inches and a\\nhalf high, were employed to draw me towards the metropolis, which, as I\\nsaid, was half a mile distant.\\n\\nAbout four hours after we began our journey, I awaked by a very\\nridiculous accident; for the carriage being stopped a while, to adjust\\nsomething that was out of order, two or three of the young natives had\\nthe curiosity to see how I looked when I was asleep; they climbed up into\\nthe engine, and advancing very softly to my face, one of them, an officer\\nin the guards, put the sharp end of his half-pike a good way up into my\\nleft nostril, which tickled my nose like a straw, and made me sneeze\\nviolently; whereupon they stole off unperceived, and it was three weeks\\nbefore I knew the cause of my waking so suddenly.  We made a long march\\nthe remaining part of the day, and, rested at night with five hundred\\nguards on each side of me, half with torches, and half with bows and\\narrows, ready to shoot me if I should offer to stir.  The next morning at\\nsun-rise we continued our march, and arrived within two hundred yards of\\nthe city gates about noon.  The emperor, and all his court, came out to\\nmeet us; but his great officers would by no means suffer his majesty to\\nendanger his person by mounting on my body.\\n\\nAt the place where the carriage stopped there stood an ancient temple,\\nesteemed to be the largest in the whole kingdom; which, having been\\npolluted some years before by an unnatural murder, was, according to the\\nzeal of those people, looked upon as profane, and therefore had been\\napplied to common use, and all the ornaments and furniture carried away.\\nIn this edifice it was determined I should lodge.  The great gate\\nfronting to the north was about four feet high, and almost two feet wide,\\nthrough which I could easily creep.  On each side of the gate was a small\\nwindow, not above six inches from the ground: into that on the left side,\\nthe king’s smith conveyed fourscore and eleven chains, like those that\\nhang to a lady’s watch in Europe, and almost as large, which were locked\\nto my left leg with six-and-thirty padlocks.  Over against this temple,\\non the other side of the great highway, at twenty feet distance, there\\nwas a turret at least five feet high.  Here the emperor ascended, with\\nmany principal lords of his court, to have an opportunity of viewing me,\\nas I was told, for I could not see them.  It was reckoned that above a\\nhundred thousand inhabitants came out of the town upon the same errand;\\nand, in spite of my guards, I believe there could not be fewer than ten\\nthousand at several times, who mounted my body by the help of ladders.\\nBut a proclamation was soon issued, to forbid it upon pain of death.\\nWhen the workmen found it was impossible for me to break loose, they cut\\nall the strings that bound me; whereupon I rose up, with as melancholy a\\ndisposition as ever I had in my life.  But the noise and astonishment of\\nthe people, at seeing me rise and walk, are not to be expressed.  The\\nchains that held my left leg were about two yards long, and gave me not\\nonly the liberty of walking backwards and forwards in a semicircle, but,\\nbeing fixed within four inches of the gate, allowed me to creep in, and\\nlie at my full length in the temple.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\n\\nThe emperor of Lilliput, attended by several of the nobility, comes to\\nsee the author in his confinement.  The emperor’s person and habit\\ndescribed.  Learned men appointed to teach the author their language.  He\\ngains favour by his mild disposition.  His pockets are searched, and his\\nsword and pistols taken from him.\\n\\nWhen I found myself on my feet, I looked about me, and must confess I\\nnever beheld a more entertaining prospect.  The country around appeared\\nlike a continued garden, and the enclosed fields, which were generally\\nforty feet square, resembled so many beds of flowers.  These fields were\\nintermingled with woods of half a stang, {301} and the tallest trees, as\\nI could judge, appeared to be seven feet high.  I viewed the town on my\\nleft hand, which looked like the painted scene of a city in a theatre.\\n\\nI had been for some hours extremely pressed by the necessities of nature;\\nwhich was no wonder, it being almost two days since I had last\\ndisburdened myself.  I was under great difficulties between urgency and\\nshame.  The best expedient I could think of, was to creep into my house,\\nwhich I accordingly did; and shutting the gate after me, I went as far as\\nthe length of my chain would suffer, and discharged my body of that\\nuneasy load.  But this was the only time I was ever guilty of so\\nuncleanly an action; for which I cannot but hope the candid reader will\\ngive some allowance, after he has maturely and impartially considered my\\ncase, and the distress I was in.  From this time my constant practice\\nwas, as soon as I rose, to perform that business in open air, at the full\\nextent of my chain; and due care was taken every morning before company\\ncame, that the offensive matter should be carried off in wheel-barrows,\\nby two servants appointed for that purpose.  I would not have dwelt so\\nlong upon a circumstance that, perhaps, at first sight, may appear not\\nvery momentous, if I had not thought it necessary to justify my\\ncharacter, in point of cleanliness, to the world; which, I am told, some\\nof my maligners have been pleased, upon this and other occasions, to call\\nin question.\\n\\nWhen this adventure was at an end, I came back out of my house, having\\noccasion for fresh air.  The emperor was already descended from the\\ntower, and advancing on horseback towards me, which had like to have cost\\nhim dear; for the beast, though very well trained, yet wholly unused to\\nsuch a sight, which appeared as if a mountain moved before him, reared up\\non its hinder feet: but that prince, who is an excellent horseman, kept\\nhis seat, till his attendants ran in, and held the bridle, while his\\nmajesty had time to dismount.  When he alighted, he surveyed me round\\nwith great admiration; but kept beyond the length of my chain.  He\\nordered his cooks and butlers, who were already prepared, to give me\\nvictuals and drink, which they pushed forward in a sort of vehicles upon\\nwheels, till I could reach them.  I took these vehicles and soon emptied\\nthem all; twenty of them were filled with meat, and ten with liquor; each\\nof the former afforded me two or three good mouthfuls; and I emptied the\\nliquor of ten vessels, which was contained in earthen vials, into one\\nvehicle, drinking it off at a draught; and so I did with the rest.  The\\nempress, and young princes of the blood of both sexes, attended by many\\nladies, sat at some distance in their chairs; but upon the accident that\\nhappened to the emperor’s horse, they alighted, and came near his person,\\nwhich I am now going to describe.  He is taller by almost the breadth of\\nmy nail, than any of his court; which alone is enough to strike an awe\\ninto the beholders.  His features are strong and masculine, with an\\nAustrian lip and arched nose, his complexion olive, his countenance\\nerect, his body and limbs well proportioned, all his motions graceful,\\nand his deportment majestic.  He was then past his prime, being\\ntwenty-eight years and three quarters old, of which he had reigned about\\nseven in great felicity, and generally victorious.  For the better\\nconvenience of beholding him, I lay on my side, so that my face was\\nparallel to his, and he stood but three yards off: however, I have had\\nhim since many times in my hand, and therefore cannot be deceived in the\\ndescription.  His dress was very plain and simple, and the fashion of it\\nbetween the Asiatic and the European; but he had on his head a light\\nhelmet of gold, adorned with jewels, and a plume on the crest.  He held\\nhis sword drawn in his hand to defend himself, if I should happen to\\nbreak loose; it was almost three inches long; the hilt and scabbard were\\ngold enriched with diamonds.  His voice was shrill, but very clear and\\narticulate; and I could distinctly hear it when I stood up.  The ladies\\nand courtiers were all most magnificently clad; so that the spot they\\nstood upon seemed to resemble a petticoat spread upon the ground,\\nembroidered with figures of gold and silver.  His imperial majesty spoke\\noften to me, and I returned answers: but neither of us could understand a\\nsyllable.  There were several of his priests and lawyers present (as I\\nconjectured by their habits), who were commanded to address themselves to\\nme; and I spoke to them in as many languages as I had the least\\nsmattering of, which were High and Low Dutch, Latin, French, Spanish,\\nItalian, and Lingua Franca, but all to no purpose.  After about two hours\\nthe court retired, and I was left with a strong guard, to prevent the\\nimpertinence, and probably the malice of the rabble, who were very\\nimpatient to crowd about me as near as they durst; and some of them had\\nthe impudence to shoot their arrows at me, as I sat on the ground by the\\ndoor of my house, whereof one very narrowly missed my left eye.  But the\\ncolonel ordered six of the ringleaders to be seized, and thought no\\npunishment so proper as to deliver them bound into my hands; which some\\nof his soldiers accordingly did, pushing them forward with the butt-ends\\nof their pikes into my reach.  I took them all in my right hand, put five\\nof them into my coat-pocket; and as to the sixth, I made a countenance as\\nif I would eat him alive.  The poor man squalled terribly, and the\\ncolonel and his officers were in much pain, especially when they saw me\\ntake out my penknife: but I soon put them out of fear; for, looking\\nmildly, and immediately cutting the strings he was bound with, I set him\\ngently on the ground, and away he ran.  I treated the rest in the same\\nmanner, taking them one by one out of my pocket; and I observed both the\\nsoldiers and people were highly delighted at this mark of my clemency,\\nwhich was represented very much to my advantage at court.\\n\\nTowards night I got with some difficulty into my house, where I lay on\\nthe ground, and continued to do so about a fortnight; during which time,\\nthe emperor gave orders to have a bed prepared for me.  Six hundred beds\\nof the common measure were brought in carriages, and worked up in my\\nhouse; a hundred and fifty of their beds, sewn together, made up the\\nbreadth and length; and these were four double: which, however, kept me\\nbut very indifferently from the hardness of the floor, that was of smooth\\nstone.  By the same computation, they provided me with sheets, blankets,\\nand coverlets, tolerable enough for one who had been so long inured to\\nhardships.\\n\\nAs the news of my arrival spread through the kingdom, it brought\\nprodigious numbers of rich, idle, and curious people to see me; so that\\nthe villages were almost emptied; and great neglect of tillage and\\nhousehold affairs must have ensued, if his imperial majesty had not\\nprovided, by several proclamations and orders of state, against this\\ninconveniency.  He directed that those who had already beheld me should\\nreturn home, and not presume to come within fifty yards of my house,\\nwithout license from the court; whereby the secretaries of state got\\nconsiderable fees.\\n\\nIn the mean time the emperor held frequent councils, to debate what\\ncourse should be taken with me; and I was afterwards assured by a\\nparticular friend, a person of great quality, who was as much in the\\nsecret as any, that the court was under many difficulties concerning me.\\nThey apprehended my breaking loose; that my diet would be very expensive,\\nand might cause a famine.  Sometimes they determined to starve me; or at\\nleast to shoot me in the face and hands with poisoned arrows, which would\\nsoon despatch me; but again they considered, that the stench of so large\\na carcass might produce a plague in the metropolis, and probably spread\\nthrough the whole kingdom.  In the midst of these consultations, several\\nofficers of the army went to the door of the great council-chamber, and\\ntwo of them being admitted, gave an account of my behaviour to the six\\ncriminals above-mentioned; which made so favourable an impression in the\\nbreast of his majesty and the whole board, in my behalf, that an imperial\\ncommission was issued out, obliging all the villages, nine hundred yards\\nround the city, to deliver in every morning six beeves, forty sheep, and\\nother victuals for my sustenance; together with a proportionable quantity\\nof bread, and wine, and other liquors; for the due payment of which, his\\nmajesty gave assignments upon his treasury:—for this prince lives chiefly\\nupon his own demesnes; seldom, except upon great occasions, raising any\\nsubsidies upon his subjects, who are bound to attend him in his wars at\\ntheir own expense.  An establishment was also made of six hundred persons\\nto be my domestics, who had board-wages allowed for their maintenance,\\nand tents built for them very conveniently on each side of my door.  It\\nwas likewise ordered, that three hundred tailors should make me a suit of\\nclothes, after the fashion of the country; that six of his majesty’s\\ngreatest scholars should be employed to instruct me in their language;\\nand lastly, that the emperor’s horses, and those of the nobility and\\ntroops of guards, should be frequently exercised in my sight, to accustom\\nthemselves to me.  All these orders were duly put in execution; and in\\nabout three weeks I made a great progress in learning their language;\\nduring which time the emperor frequently honoured me with his visits, and\\nwas pleased to assist my masters in teaching me.  We began already to\\nconverse together in some sort; and the first words I learnt, were to\\nexpress my desire “that he would please give me my liberty;” which I\\nevery day repeated on my knees.  His answer, as I could comprehend it,\\nwas, “that this must be a work of time, not to be thought on without the\\nadvice of his council, and that first I must _lumos kelmin pesso desmar\\nlon emposo_;” that is, swear a peace with him and his kingdom.  However,\\nthat I should be used with all kindness.  And he advised me to “acquire,\\nby my patience and discreet behaviour, the good opinion of himself and\\nhis subjects.”  He desired “I would not take it ill, if he gave orders to\\ncertain proper officers to search me; for probably I might carry about me\\nseveral weapons, which must needs be dangerous things, if they answered\\nthe bulk of so prodigious a person.”  I said, “His majesty should be\\nsatisfied; for I was ready to strip myself, and turn up my pockets before\\nhim.”  This I delivered part in words, and part in signs.  He replied,\\n“that, by the laws of the kingdom, I must be searched by two of his\\nofficers; that he knew this could not be done without my consent and\\nassistance; and he had so good an opinion of my generosity and justice,\\nas to trust their persons in my hands; that whatever they took from me,\\nshould be returned when I left the country, or paid for at the rate which\\nI would set upon them.”  I took up the two officers in my hands, put them\\nfirst into my coat-pockets, and then into every other pocket about me,\\nexcept my two fobs, and another secret pocket, which I had no mind should\\nbe searched, wherein I had some little necessaries that were of no\\nconsequence to any but myself.  In one of my fobs there was a silver\\nwatch, and in the other a small quantity of gold in a purse.  These\\ngentlemen, having pen, ink, and paper, about them, made an exact\\ninventory of every thing they saw; and when they had done, desired I\\nwould set them down, that they might deliver it to the emperor.  This\\ninventory I afterwards translated into English, and is, word for word, as\\nfollows:\\n\\n    “_Imprimis_: In the right coat-pocket of the great man-mountain” (for\\n    so I interpret the words _quinbus flestrin_,) “after the strictest\\n    search, we found only one great piece of coarse-cloth, large enough\\n    to be a foot-cloth for your majesty’s chief room of state.  In the\\n    left pocket we saw a huge silver chest, with a cover of the same\\n    metal, which we, the searchers, were not able to lift.  We desired it\\n    should be opened, and one of us stepping into it, found himself up to\\n    the mid leg in a sort of dust, some part whereof flying up to our\\n    faces set us both a sneezing for several times together.  In his\\n    right waistcoat-pocket we found a prodigious bundle of white thin\\n    substances, folded one over another, about the bigness of three men,\\n    tied with a strong cable, and marked with black figures; which we\\n    humbly conceive to be writings, every letter almost half as large as\\n    the palm of our hands.  In the left there was a sort of engine, from\\n    the back of which were extended twenty long poles, resembling the\\n    pallisados before your majesty’s court: wherewith we conjecture the\\n    man-mountain combs his head; for we did not always trouble him with\\n    questions, because we found it a great difficulty to make him\\n    understand us.  In the large pocket, on the right side of his middle\\n    cover” (so I translate the word _ranfulo_, by which they meant my\\n    breeches,) “we saw a hollow pillar of iron, about the length of a\\n    man, fastened to a strong piece of timber larger than the pillar; and\\n    upon one side of the pillar, were huge pieces of iron sticking out,\\n    cut into strange figures, which we know not what to make of.  In the\\n    left pocket, another engine of the same kind.  In the smaller pocket\\n    on the right side, were several round flat pieces of white and red\\n    metal, of different bulk; some of the white, which seemed to be\\n    silver, were so large and heavy, that my comrade and I could hardly\\n    lift them.  In the left pocket were two black pillars irregularly\\n    shaped: we could not, without difficulty, reach the top of them, as\\n    we stood at the bottom of his pocket.  One of them was covered, and\\n    seemed all of a piece: but at the upper end of the other there\\n    appeared a white round substance, about twice the bigness of our\\n    heads.  Within each of these was enclosed a prodigious plate of\\n    steel; which, by our orders, we obliged him to show us, because we\\n    apprehended they might be dangerous engines.  He took them out of\\n    their cases, and told us, that in his own country his practice was to\\n    shave his beard with one of these, and cut his meat with the other.\\n    There were two pockets which we could not enter: these he called his\\n    fobs; they were two large slits cut into the top of his middle cover,\\n    but squeezed close by the pressure of his belly.  Out of the right\\n    fob hung a great silver chain, with a wonderful kind of engine at the\\n    bottom.  We directed him to draw out whatever was at the end of that\\n    chain; which appeared to be a globe, half silver, and half of some\\n    transparent metal; for, on the transparent side, we saw certain\\n    strange figures circularly drawn, and thought we could touch them,\\n    till we found our fingers stopped by the lucid substance.  He put\\n    this engine into our ears, which made an incessant noise, like that\\n    of a water-mill: and we conjecture it is either some unknown animal,\\n    or the god that he worships; but we are more inclined to the latter\\n    opinion, because he assured us, (if we understood him right, for he\\n    expressed himself very imperfectly) that he seldom did any thing\\n    without consulting it.  He called it his oracle, and said, it pointed\\n    out the time for every action of his life.  From the left fob he took\\n    out a net almost large enough for a fisherman, but contrived to open\\n    and shut like a purse, and served him for the same use: we found\\n    therein several massy pieces of yellow metal, which, if they be real\\n    gold, must be of immense value.\\n\\n    “Having thus, in obedience to your majesty’s commands, diligently\\n    searched all his pockets, we observed a girdle about his waist made\\n    of the hide of some prodigious animal, from which, on the left side,\\n    hung a sword of the length of five men; and on the right, a bag or\\n    pouch divided into two cells, each cell capable of holding three of\\n    your majesty’s subjects.  In one of these cells were several globes,\\n    or balls, of a most ponderous metal, about the bigness of our heads,\\n    and requiring a strong hand to lift them: the other cell contained a\\n    heap of certain black grains, but of no great bulk or weight, for we\\n    could hold above fifty of them in the palms of our hands.\\n\\n    “This is an exact inventory of what we found about the body of the\\n    man-mountain, who used us with great civility, and due respect to\\n    your majesty’s commission.  Signed and sealed on the fourth day of\\n    the eighty-ninth moon of your majesty’s auspicious reign.\\n\\n                                          CLEFRIN FRELOCK, MARSI FRELOCK.”\\n\\nWhen this inventory was read over to the emperor, he directed me,\\nalthough in very gentle terms, to deliver up the several particulars.  He\\nfirst called for my scimitar, which I took out, scabbard and all.  In the\\nmean time he ordered three thousand of his choicest troops (who then\\nattended him) to surround me at a distance, with their bows and arrows\\njust ready to discharge; but I did not observe it, for mine eyes were\\nwholly fixed upon his majesty.  He then desired me to draw my scimitar,\\nwhich, although it had got some rust by the sea water, was, in most\\nparts, exceeding bright.  I did so, and immediately all the troops gave a\\nshout between terror and surprise; for the sun shone clear, and the\\nreflection dazzled their eyes, as I waved the scimitar to and fro in my\\nhand.  His majesty, who is a most magnanimous prince, was less daunted\\nthan I could expect: he ordered me to return it into the scabbard, and\\ncast it on the ground as gently as I could, about six feet from the end\\nof my chain.  The next thing he demanded was one of the hollow iron\\npillars; by which he meant my pocket pistols.  I drew it out, and at his\\ndesire, as well as I could, expressed to him the use of it; and charging\\nit only with powder, which, by the closeness of my pouch, happened to\\nescape wetting in the sea (an inconvenience against which all prudent\\nmariners take special care to provide,) I first cautioned the emperor not\\nto be afraid, and then I let it off in the air.  The astonishment here\\nwas much greater than at the sight of my scimitar.  Hundreds fell down as\\nif they had been struck dead; and even the emperor, although he stood his\\nground, could not recover himself for some time.  I delivered up both my\\npistols in the same manner as I had done my scimitar, and then my pouch\\nof powder and bullets; begging him that the former might be kept from\\nfire, for it would kindle with the smallest spark, and blow up his\\nimperial palace into the air.  I likewise delivered up my watch, which\\nthe emperor was very curious to see, and commanded two of his tallest\\nyeomen of the guards to bear it on a pole upon their shoulders, as\\ndraymen in England do a barrel of ale.  He was amazed at the continual\\nnoise it made, and the motion of the minute-hand, which he could easily\\ndiscern; for their sight is much more acute than ours: he asked the\\nopinions of his learned men about it, which were various and remote, as\\nthe reader may well imagine without my repeating; although indeed I could\\nnot very perfectly understand them.  I then gave up my silver and copper\\nmoney, my purse, with nine large pieces of gold, and some smaller ones;\\nmy knife and razor, my comb and silver snuff-box, my handkerchief and\\njournal-book.  My scimitar, pistols, and pouch, were conveyed in\\ncarriages to his majesty’s stores; but the rest of my goods were returned\\nme.\\n\\nI had as I before observed, one private pocket, which escaped their\\nsearch, wherein there was a pair of spectacles (which I sometimes use for\\nthe weakness of mine eyes,) a pocket perspective, and some other little\\nconveniences; which, being of no consequence to the emperor, I did not\\nthink myself bound in honour to discover, and I apprehended they might be\\nlost or spoiled if I ventured them out of my possession.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\n\\nThe author diverts the emperor, and his nobility of both sexes, in a very\\nuncommon manner.  The diversions of the court of Lilliput described.  The\\nauthor has his liberty granted him upon certain conditions.\\n\\nMy gentleness and good behaviour had gained so far on the emperor and his\\ncourt, and indeed upon the army and people in general, that I began to\\nconceive hopes of getting my liberty in a short time.  I took all\\npossible methods to cultivate this favourable disposition.  The natives\\ncame, by degrees, to be less apprehensive of any danger from me.  I would\\nsometimes lie down, and let five or six of them dance on my hand; and at\\nlast the boys and girls would venture to come and play at hide-and-seek\\nin my hair.  I had now made a good progress in understanding and speaking\\nthe language.  The emperor had a mind one day to entertain me with\\nseveral of the country shows, wherein they exceed all nations I have\\nknown, both for dexterity and magnificence.  I was diverted with none so\\nmuch as that of the rope-dancers, performed upon a slender white thread,\\nextended about two feet, and twelve inches from the ground.  Upon which I\\nshall desire liberty, with the reader’s patience, to enlarge a little.\\n\\nThis diversion is only practised by those persons who are candidates for\\ngreat employments, and high favour at court.  They are trained in this\\nart from their youth, and are not always of noble birth, or liberal\\neducation.  When a great office is vacant, either by death or disgrace\\n(which often happens,) five or six of those candidates petition the\\nemperor to entertain his majesty and the court with a dance on the rope;\\nand whoever jumps the highest, without falling, succeeds in the office.\\nVery often the chief ministers themselves are commanded to show their\\nskill, and to convince the emperor that they have not lost their faculty.\\nFlimnap, the treasurer, is allowed to cut a caper on the straight rope,\\nat least an inch higher than any other lord in the whole empire.  I have\\nseen him do the summerset several times together, upon a trencher fixed\\non a rope which is no thicker than a common packthread in England.  My\\nfriend Reldresal, principal secretary for private affairs, is, in my\\nopinion, if I am not partial, the second after the treasurer; the rest of\\nthe great officers are much upon a par.\\n\\nThese diversions are often attended with fatal accidents, whereof great\\nnumbers are on record.  I myself have seen two or three candidates break\\na limb.  But the danger is much greater, when the ministers themselves\\nare commanded to show their dexterity; for, by contending to excel\\nthemselves and their fellows, they strain so far that there is hardly one\\nof them who has not received a fall, and some of them two or three.  I\\nwas assured that, a year or two before my arrival, Flimnap would\\ninfallibly have broke his neck, if one of the king’s cushions, that\\naccidentally lay on the ground, had not weakened the force of his fall.\\n\\nThere is likewise another diversion, which is only shown before the\\nemperor and empress, and first minister, upon particular occasions.  The\\nemperor lays on the table three fine silken threads of six inches long;\\none is blue, the other red, and the third green.  These threads are\\nproposed as prizes for those persons whom the emperor has a mind to\\ndistinguish by a peculiar mark of his favour.  The ceremony is performed\\nin his majesty’s great chamber of state, where the candidates are to\\nundergo a trial of dexterity very different from the former, and such as\\nI have not observed the least resemblance of in any other country of the\\nnew or old world.  The emperor holds a stick in his hands, both ends\\nparallel to the horizon, while the candidates advancing, one by one,\\nsometimes leap over the stick, sometimes creep under it, backward and\\nforward, several times, according as the stick is advanced or depressed.\\nSometimes the emperor holds one end of the stick, and his first minister\\nthe other; sometimes the minister has it entirely to himself.  Whoever\\nperforms his part with most agility, and holds out the longest in leaping\\nand creeping, is rewarded with the blue-coloured silk; the red is given\\nto the next, and the green to the third, which they all wear girt twice\\nround about the middle; and you see few great persons about this court\\nwho are not adorned with one of these girdles.\\n\\nThe horses of the army, and those of the royal stables, having been daily\\nled before me, were no longer shy, but would come up to my very feet\\nwithout starting.  The riders would leap them over my hand, as I held it\\non the ground; and one of the emperor’s huntsmen, upon a large courser,\\ntook my foot, shoe and all; which was indeed a prodigious leap.  I had\\nthe good fortune to divert the emperor one day after a very extraordinary\\nmanner.  I desired he would order several sticks of two feet high, and\\nthe thickness of an ordinary cane, to be brought me; whereupon his\\nmajesty commanded the master of his woods to give directions accordingly;\\nand the next morning six woodmen arrived with as many carriages, drawn by\\neight horses to each.  I took nine of these sticks, and fixing them\\nfirmly in the ground in a quadrangular figure, two feet and a half\\nsquare, I took four other sticks, and tied them parallel at each corner,\\nabout two feet from the ground; then I fastened my handkerchief to the\\nnine sticks that stood erect; and extended it on all sides, till it was\\ntight as the top of a drum; and the four parallel sticks, rising about\\nfive inches higher than the handkerchief, served as ledges on each side.\\nWhen I had finished my work, I desired the emperor to let a troop of his\\nbest horses twenty-four in number, come and exercise upon this plain.\\nHis majesty approved of the proposal, and I took them up, one by one, in\\nmy hands, ready mounted and armed, with the proper officers to exercise\\nthem.  As soon as they got into order they divided into two parties,\\nperformed mock skirmishes, discharged blunt arrows, drew their swords,\\nfled and pursued, attacked and retired, and in short discovered the best\\nmilitary discipline I ever beheld.  The parallel sticks secured them and\\ntheir horses from falling over the stage; and the emperor was so much\\ndelighted, that he ordered this entertainment to be repeated several\\ndays, and once was pleased to be lifted up and give the word of command;\\nand with great difficulty persuaded even the empress herself to let me\\nhold her in her close chair within two yards of the stage, when she was\\nable to take a full view of the whole performance.  It was my good\\nfortune, that no ill accident happened in these entertainments; only once\\na fiery horse, that belonged to one of the captains, pawing with his\\nhoof, struck a hole in my handkerchief, and his foot slipping, he\\noverthrew his rider and himself; but I immediately relieved them both,\\nand covering the hole with one hand, I set down the troop with the other,\\nin the same manner as I took them up. The horse that fell was strained in\\nthe left shoulder, but the rider got no hurt; and I repaired my\\nhandkerchief as well as I could: however, I would not trust to the\\nstrength of it any more, in such dangerous enterprises.\\n\\nAbout two or three days before I was set at liberty, as I was\\nentertaining the court with this kind of feat, there arrived an express\\nto inform his majesty, that some of his subjects, riding near the place\\nwhere I was first taken up, had seen a great black substance lying on the\\naround, very oddly shaped, extending its edges round, as wide as his\\nmajesty’s bedchamber, and rising up in the middle as high as a man; that\\nit was no living creature, as they at first apprehended, for it lay on\\nthe grass without motion; and some of them had walked round it several\\ntimes; that, by mounting upon each other’s shoulders, they had got to the\\ntop, which was flat and even, and, stamping upon it, they found that it\\nwas hollow within; that they humbly conceived it might be something\\nbelonging to the man-mountain; and if his majesty pleased, they would\\nundertake to bring it with only five horses.  I presently knew what they\\nmeant, and was glad at heart to receive this intelligence.  It seems,\\nupon my first reaching the shore after our shipwreck, I was in such\\nconfusion, that before I came to the place where I went to sleep, my hat,\\nwhich I had fastened with a string to my head while I was rowing, and had\\nstuck on all the time I was swimming, fell off after I came to land; the\\nstring, as I conjecture, breaking by some accident, which I never\\nobserved, but thought my hat had been lost at sea.  I entreated his\\nimperial majesty to give orders it might be brought to me as soon as\\npossible, describing to him the use and the nature of it: and the next\\nday the waggoners arrived with it, but not in a very good condition; they\\nhad bored two holes in the brim, within an inch and half of the edge, and\\nfastened two hooks in the holes; these hooks were tied by a long cord to\\nthe harness, and thus my hat was dragged along for above half an English\\nmile; but, the ground in that country being extremely smooth and level,\\nit received less damage than I expected.\\n\\nTwo days after this adventure, the emperor, having ordered that part of\\nhis army which quarters in and about his metropolis, to be in readiness,\\ntook a fancy of diverting himself in a very singular manner.  He desired\\nI would stand like a Colossus, with my legs as far asunder as I\\nconveniently could.  He then commanded his general (who was an old\\nexperienced leader, and a great patron of mine) to draw up the troops in\\nclose order, and march them under me; the foot by twenty-four abreast,\\nand the horse by sixteen, with drums beating, colours flying, and pikes\\nadvanced.  This body consisted of three thousand foot, and a thousand\\nhorse.  His majesty gave orders, upon pain of death, that every soldier\\nin his march should observe the strictest decency with regard to my\\nperson; which however could not prevent some of the younger officers from\\nturning up their eyes as they passed under me: and, to confess the truth,\\nmy breeches were at that time in so ill a condition, that they afforded\\nsome opportunities for laughter and admiration.\\n\\nI had sent so many memorials and petitions for my liberty, that his\\nmajesty at length mentioned the matter, first in the cabinet, and then in\\na full council; where it was opposed by none, except Skyresh Bolgolam,\\nwho was pleased, without any provocation, to be my mortal enemy.  But it\\nwas carried against him by the whole board, and confirmed by the emperor.\\nThat minister was _galbet_, or admiral of the realm, very much in his\\nmaster’s confidence, and a person well versed in affairs, but of a morose\\nand sour complexion.  However, he was at length persuaded to comply; but\\nprevailed that the articles and conditions upon which I should be set\\nfree, and to which I must swear, should be drawn up by himself.  These\\narticles were brought to me by Skyresh Bolgolam in person attended by two\\nunder-secretaries, and several persons of distinction.  After they were\\nread, I was demanded to swear to the performance of them; first in the\\nmanner of my own country, and afterwards in the method prescribed by\\ntheir laws; which was, to hold my right foot in my left hand, and to\\nplace the middle finger of my right hand on the crown of my head, and my\\nthumb on the tip of my right ear.  But because the reader may be curious\\nto have some idea of the style and manner of expression peculiar to that\\npeople, as well as to know the article upon which I recovered my liberty,\\nI have made a translation of the whole instrument, word for word, as near\\nas I was able, which I here offer to the public.\\n\\n“Golbasto Momarem Evlame Gurdilo Shefin Mully Ully Gue, most mighty\\nEmperor of Lilliput, delight and terror of the universe, whose dominions\\nextend five thousand _blustrugs_ (about twelve miles in circumference) to\\nthe extremities of the globe; monarch of all monarchs, taller than the\\nsons of men; whose feet press down to the centre, and whose head strikes\\nagainst the sun; at whose nod the princes of the earth shake their knees;\\npleasant as the spring, comfortable as the summer, fruitful as autumn,\\ndreadful as winter: his most sublime majesty proposes to the\\nman-mountain, lately arrived at our celestial dominions, the following\\narticles, which, by a solemn oath, he shall be obliged to perform:—\\n\\n“1st, The man-mountain shall not depart from our dominions, without our\\nlicense under our great seal.\\n\\n“2d, He shall not presume to come into our metropolis, without our\\nexpress order; at which time, the inhabitants shall have two hours\\nwarning to keep within doors.\\n\\n“3d, The said man-mountain shall confine his walks to our principal high\\nroads, and not offer to walk, or lie down, in a meadow or field of corn.\\n\\n“4th, As he walks the said roads, he shall take the utmost care not to\\ntrample upon the bodies of any of our loving subjects, their horses, or\\ncarriages, nor take any of our subjects into his hands without their own\\nconsent.\\n\\n“5th, If an express requires extraordinary despatch, the man-mountain\\nshall be obliged to carry, in his pocket, the messenger and horse a six\\ndays journey, once in every moon, and return the said messenger back (if\\nso required) safe to our imperial presence.\\n\\n“6th, He shall be our ally against our enemies in the island of Blefuscu,\\nand do his utmost to destroy their fleet, which is now preparing to\\ninvade us.\\n\\n“7th, That the said man-mountain shall, at his times of leisure, be\\naiding and assisting to our workmen, in helping to raise certain great\\nstones, towards covering the wall of the principal park, and other our\\nroyal buildings.\\n\\n“8th, That the said man-mountain shall, in two moons’ time, deliver in an\\nexact survey of the circumference of our dominions, by a computation of\\nhis own paces round the coast.\\n\\n“Lastly, That, upon his solemn oath to observe all the above articles,\\nthe said man-mountain shall have a daily allowance of meat and drink\\nsufficient for the support of 1724 of our subjects, with free access to\\nour royal person, and other marks of our favour.  Given at our palace at\\nBelfaborac, the twelfth day of the ninety-first moon of our reign.”\\n\\nI swore and subscribed to these articles with great cheerfulness and\\ncontent, although some of them were not so honourable as I could have\\nwished; which proceeded wholly from the malice of Skyresh Bolgolam, the\\nhigh-admiral: whereupon my chains were immediately unlocked, and I was at\\nfull liberty.  The emperor himself, in person, did me the honour to be by\\nat the whole ceremony.  I made my acknowledgements by prostrating myself\\nat his majesty’s feet: but he commanded me to rise; and after many\\ngracious expressions, which, to avoid the censure of vanity, I shall not\\nrepeat, he added, “that he hoped I should prove a useful servant, and\\nwell deserve all the favours he had already conferred upon me, or might\\ndo for the future.”\\n\\nThe reader may please to observe, that, in the last article of the\\nrecovery of my liberty, the emperor stipulates to allow me a quantity of\\nmeat and drink sufficient for the support of 1724 Lilliputians.  Some\\ntime after, asking a friend at court how they came to fix on that\\ndeterminate number, he told me that his majesty’s mathematicians, having\\ntaken the height of my body by the help of a quadrant, and finding it to\\nexceed theirs in the proportion of twelve to one, they concluded from the\\nsimilarity of their bodies, that mine must contain at least 1724 of\\ntheirs, and consequently would require as much food as was necessary to\\nsupport that number of Lilliputians.  By which the reader may conceive an\\nidea of the ingenuity of that people, as well as the prudent and exact\\neconomy of so great a prince.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\n\\nMildendo, the metropolis of Lilliput, described, together with the\\nemperor’s palace.  A conversation between the author and a principal\\nsecretary, concerning the affairs of that empire.  The author’s offers to\\nserve the emperor in his wars.\\n\\nThe first request I made, after I had obtained my liberty, was, that I\\nmight have license to see Mildendo, the metropolis; which the emperor\\neasily granted me, but with a special charge to do no hurt either to the\\ninhabitants or their houses.  The people had notice, by proclamation, of\\nmy design to visit the town.  The wall which encompassed it is two feet\\nand a half high, and at least eleven inches broad, so that a coach and\\nhorses may be driven very safely round it; and it is flanked with strong\\ntowers at ten feet distance.  I stepped over the great western gate, and\\npassed very gently, and sidling, through the two principal streets, only\\nin my short waistcoat, for fear of damaging the roofs and eaves of the\\nhouses with the skirts of my coat.  I walked with the utmost\\ncircumspection, to avoid treading on any stragglers who might remain in\\nthe streets, although the orders were very strict, that all people should\\nkeep in their houses, at their own peril.  The garret windows and tops of\\nhouses were so crowded with spectators, that I thought in all my travels\\nI had not seen a more populous place.  The city is an exact square, each\\nside of the wall being five hundred feet long.  The two great streets,\\nwhich run across and divide it into four quarters, are five feet wide.\\nThe lanes and alleys, which I could not enter, but only view them as I\\npassed, are from twelve to eighteen inches.  The town is capable of\\nholding five hundred thousand souls: the houses are from three to five\\nstories: the shops and markets well provided.\\n\\nThe emperor’s palace is in the centre of the city where the two great\\nstreets meet.  It is enclosed by a wall of two feet high, and twenty feet\\ndistance from the buildings.  I had his majesty’s permission to step over\\nthis wall; and, the space being so wide between that and the palace, I\\ncould easily view it on every side.  The outward court is a square of\\nforty feet, and includes two other courts: in the inmost are the royal\\napartments, which I was very desirous to see, but found it extremely\\ndifficult; for the great gates, from one square into another, were but\\neighteen inches high, and seven inches wide.  Now the buildings of the\\nouter court were at least five feet high, and it was impossible for me to\\nstride over them without infinite damage to the pile, though the walls\\nwere strongly built of hewn stone, and four inches thick.  At the same\\ntime the emperor had a great desire that I should see the magnificence of\\nhis palace; but this I was not able to do till three days after, which I\\nspent in cutting down with my knife some of the largest trees in the\\nroyal park, about a hundred yards distant from the city.  Of these trees\\nI made two stools, each about three feet high, and strong enough to bear\\nmy weight.  The people having received notice a second time, I went again\\nthrough the city to the palace with my two stools in my hands.  When I\\ncame to the side of the outer court, I stood upon one stool, and took the\\nother in my hand; this I lifted over the roof, and gently set it down on\\nthe space between the first and second court, which was eight feet wide.\\nI then stept over the building very conveniently from one stool to the\\nother, and drew up the first after me with a hooked stick.  By this\\ncontrivance I got into the inmost court; and, lying down upon my side, I\\napplied my face to the windows of the middle stories, which were left\\nopen on purpose, and discovered the most splendid apartments that can be\\nimagined.  There I saw the empress and the young princes, in their\\nseveral lodgings, with their chief attendants about them.  Her imperial\\nmajesty was pleased to smile very graciously upon me, and gave me out of\\nthe window her hand to kiss.\\n\\nBut I shall not anticipate the reader with further descriptions of this\\nkind, because I reserve them for a greater work, which is now almost\\nready for the press; containing a general description of this empire,\\nfrom its first erection, through along series of princes; with a\\nparticular account of their wars and politics, laws, learning, and\\nreligion; their plants and animals; their peculiar manners and customs,\\nwith other matters very curious and useful; my chief design at present\\nbeing only to relate such events and transactions as happened to the\\npublic or to myself during a residence of about nine months in that\\nempire.\\n\\nOne morning, about a fortnight after I had obtained my liberty,\\nReldresal, principal secretary (as they style him) for private affairs,\\ncame to my house attended only by one servant.  He ordered his coach to\\nwait at a distance, and desired I would give him an hours audience; which\\nI readily consented to, on account of his quality and personal merits, as\\nwell as of the many good offices he had done me during my solicitations\\nat court.  I offered to lie down that he might the more conveniently\\nreach my ear, but he chose rather to let me hold him in my hand during\\nour conversation.  He began with compliments on my liberty; said “he\\nmight pretend to some merit in it;” but, however, added, “that if it had\\nnot been for the present situation of things at court, perhaps I might\\nnot have obtained it so soon.  For,” said he, “as flourishing a condition\\nas we may appear to be in to foreigners, we labour under two mighty\\nevils: a violent faction at home, and the danger of an invasion, by a\\nmost potent enemy, from abroad.  As to the first, you are to understand,\\nthat for about seventy moons past there have been two struggling parties\\nin this empire, under the names of _Tramecksan_ and _Slamecksan_, from\\nthe high and low heels of their shoes, by which they distinguish\\nthemselves.  It is alleged, indeed, that the high heels are most\\nagreeable to our ancient constitution; but, however this be, his majesty\\nhas determined to make use only of low heels in the administration of the\\ngovernment, and all offices in the gift of the crown, as you cannot but\\nobserve; and particularly that his majesty’s imperial heels are lower at\\nleast by a _drurr_ than any of his court (_drurr_ is a measure about the\\nfourteenth part of an inch).  The animosities between these two parties\\nrun so high, that they will neither eat, nor drink, nor talk with each\\nother.  We compute the _Tramecksan_, or high heels, to exceed us in\\nnumber; but the power is wholly on our side.  We apprehend his imperial\\nhighness, the heir to the crown, to have some tendency towards the high\\nheels; at least we can plainly discover that one of his heels is higher\\nthan the other, which gives him a hobble in his gait.  Now, in the midst\\nof these intestine disquiets, we are threatened with an invasion from the\\nisland of Blefuscu, which is the other great empire of the universe,\\nalmost as large and powerful as this of his majesty.  For as to what we\\nhave heard you affirm, that there are other kingdoms and states in the\\nworld inhabited by human creatures as large as yourself, our philosophers\\nare in much doubt, and would rather conjecture that you dropped from the\\nmoon, or one of the stars; because it is certain, that a hundred mortals\\nof your bulk would in a short time destroy all the fruits and cattle of\\nhis majesty’s dominions: besides, our histories of six thousand moons\\nmake no mention of any other regions than the two great empires of\\nLilliput and Blefuscu.  Which two mighty powers have, as I was going to\\ntell you, been engaged in a most obstinate war for six-and-thirty moons\\npast.  It began upon the following occasion.  It is allowed on all hands,\\nthat the primitive way of breaking eggs, before we eat them, was upon the\\nlarger end; but his present majesty’s grandfather, while he was a boy,\\ngoing to eat an egg, and breaking it according to the ancient practice,\\nhappened to cut one of his fingers.  Whereupon the emperor his father\\npublished an edict, commanding all his subjects, upon great penalties, to\\nbreak the smaller end of their eggs.  The people so highly resented this\\nlaw, that our histories tell us, there have been six rebellions raised on\\nthat account; wherein one emperor lost his life, and another his crown.\\nThese civil commotions were constantly fomented by the monarchs of\\nBlefuscu; and when they were quelled, the exiles always fled for refuge\\nto that empire.  It is computed that eleven thousand persons have at\\nseveral times suffered death, rather than submit to break their eggs at\\nthe smaller end.  Many hundred large volumes have been published upon\\nthis controversy: but the books of the Big-endians have been long\\nforbidden, and the whole party rendered incapable by law of holding\\nemployments.  During the course of these troubles, the emperors of\\nBlefusca did frequently expostulate by their ambassadors, accusing us of\\nmaking a schism in religion, by offending against a fundamental doctrine\\nof our great prophet Lustrog, in the fifty-fourth chapter of the\\nBlundecral (which is their Alcoran).  This, however, is thought to be a\\nmere strain upon the text; for the words are these: ‘that all true\\nbelievers break their eggs at the convenient end.’  And which is the\\nconvenient end, seems, in my humble opinion to be left to every man’s\\nconscience, or at least in the power of the chief magistrate to\\ndetermine.  Now, the Big-endian exiles have found so much credit in the\\nemperor of Blefuscu’s court, and so much private assistance and\\nencouragement from their party here at home, that a bloody war has been\\ncarried on between the two empires for six-and-thirty moons, with various\\nsuccess; during which time we have lost forty capital ships, and a much a\\ngreater number of smaller vessels, together with thirty thousand of our\\nbest seamen and soldiers; and the damage received by the enemy is\\nreckoned to be somewhat greater than ours.  However, they have now\\nequipped a numerous fleet, and are just preparing to make a descent upon\\nus; and his imperial majesty, placing great confidence in your valour and\\nstrength, has commanded me to lay this account of his affairs before\\nyou.”\\n\\nI desired the secretary to present my humble duty to the emperor; and to\\nlet him know, “that I thought it would not become me, who was a\\nforeigner, to interfere with parties; but I was ready, with the hazard of\\nmy life, to defend his person and state against all invaders.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\n\\nThe author, by an extraordinary stratagem, prevents an invasion.  A high\\ntitle of honour is conferred upon him.  Ambassadors arrive from the\\nemperor of Blefuscu, and sue for peace.  The empress’s apartment on fire\\nby an accident; the author instrumental in saving the rest of the palace.\\n\\nThe empire of Blefuscu is an island situated to the north-east of\\nLilliput, from which it is parted only by a channel of eight hundred\\nyards wide.  I had not yet seen it, and upon this notice of an intended\\ninvasion, I avoided appearing on that side of the coast, for fear of\\nbeing discovered, by some of the enemy’s ships, who had received no\\nintelligence of me; all intercourse between the two empires having been\\nstrictly forbidden during the war, upon pain of death, and an embargo\\nlaid by our emperor upon all vessels whatsoever.  I communicated to his\\nmajesty a project I had formed of seizing the enemy’s whole fleet; which,\\nas our scouts assured us, lay at anchor in the harbour, ready to sail\\nwith the first fair wind.  I consulted the most experienced seamen upon\\nthe depth of the channel, which they had often plumbed; who told me, that\\nin the middle, at high-water, it was seventy _glumgluffs_ deep, which is\\nabout six feet of European measure; and the rest of it fifty _glumgluffs_\\nat most.  I walked towards the north-east coast, over against Blefuscu,\\nwhere, lying down behind a hillock, I took out my small perspective\\nglass, and viewed the enemy’s fleet at anchor, consisting of about fifty\\nmen of war, and a great number of transports: I then came back to my\\nhouse, and gave orders (for which I had a warrant) for a great quantity\\nof the strongest cable and bars of iron.  The cable was about as thick as\\npackthread and the bars of the length and size of a knitting-needle.  I\\ntrebled the cable to make it stronger, and for the same reason I twisted\\nthree of the iron bars together, bending the extremities into a hook.\\nHaving thus fixed fifty hooks to as many cables, I went back to the\\nnorth-east coast, and putting off my coat, shoes, and stockings, walked\\ninto the sea, in my leathern jerkin, about half an hour before high\\nwater.  I waded with what haste I could, and swam in the middle about\\nthirty yards, till I felt ground.  I arrived at the fleet in less than\\nhalf an hour.  The enemy was so frightened when they saw me, that they\\nleaped out of their ships, and swam to shore, where there could not be\\nfewer than thirty thousand souls.  I then took my tackling, and,\\nfastening a hook to the hole at the prow of each, I tied all the cords\\ntogether at the end.  While I was thus employed, the enemy discharged\\nseveral thousand arrows, many of which stuck in my hands and face, and,\\nbeside the excessive smart, gave me much disturbance in my work.  My\\ngreatest apprehension was for mine eyes, which I should have infallibly\\nlost, if I had not suddenly thought of an expedient.  I kept, among other\\nlittle necessaries, a pair of spectacles in a private pocket, which, as I\\nobserved before, had escaped the emperor’s searchers.  These I took out\\nand fastened as strongly as I could upon my nose, and thus armed, went on\\nboldly with my work, in spite of the enemy’s arrows, many of which struck\\nagainst the glasses of my spectacles, but without any other effect,\\nfurther than a little to discompose them.  I had now fastened all the\\nhooks, and, taking the knot in my hand, began to pull; but not a ship\\nwould stir, for they were all too fast held by their anchors, so that the\\nboldest part of my enterprise remained.  I therefore let go the cord, and\\nleaving the looks fixed to the ships, I resolutely cut with my knife the\\ncables that fastened the anchors, receiving about two hundred shots in my\\nface and hands; then I took up the knotted end of the cables, to which my\\nhooks were tied, and with great ease drew fifty of the enemy’s largest\\nmen of war after me.\\n\\nThe Blefuscudians, who had not the least imagination of what I intended,\\nwere at first confounded with astonishment.  They had seen me cut the\\ncables, and thought my design was only to let the ships run adrift or\\nfall foul on each other: but when they perceived the whole fleet moving\\nin order, and saw me pulling at the end, they set up such a scream of\\ngrief and despair as it is almost impossible to describe or conceive.\\nWhen I had got out of danger, I stopped awhile to pick out the arrows\\nthat stuck in my hands and face; and rubbed on some of the same ointment\\nthat was given me at my first arrival, as I have formerly mentioned.  I\\nthen took off my spectacles, and waiting about an hour, till the tide was\\na little fallen, I waded through the middle with my cargo, and arrived\\nsafe at the royal port of Lilliput.\\n\\nThe emperor and his whole court stood on the shore, expecting the issue\\nof this great adventure.  They saw the ships move forward in a large\\nhalf-moon, but could not discern me, who was up to my breast in water.\\nWhen I advanced to the middle of the channel, they were yet more in pain,\\nbecause I was under water to my neck.  The emperor concluded me to be\\ndrowned, and that the enemy’s fleet was approaching in a hostile manner:\\nbut he was soon eased of his fears; for the channel growing shallower\\nevery step I made, I came in a short time within hearing, and holding up\\nthe end of the cable, by which the fleet was fastened, I cried in a loud\\nvoice, “Long live the most puissant king of Lilliput!”  This great prince\\nreceived me at my landing with all possible encomiums, and created me a\\n_nardac_ upon the spot, which is the highest title of honour among them.\\n\\nHis majesty desired I would take some other opportunity of bringing all\\nthe rest of his enemy’s ships into his ports.  And so unmeasureable is\\nthe ambition of princes, that he seemed to think of nothing less than\\nreducing the whole empire of Blefuscu into a province, and governing it,\\nby a viceroy; of destroying the Big-endian exiles, and compelling that\\npeople to break the smaller end of their eggs, by which he would remain\\nthe sole monarch of the whole world.  But I endeavoured to divert him\\nfrom this design, by many arguments drawn from the topics of policy as\\nwell as justice; and I plainly protested, “that I would never be an\\ninstrument of bringing a free and brave people into slavery.”  And, when\\nthe matter was debated in council, the wisest part of the ministry were\\nof my opinion.\\n\\nThis open bold declaration of mine was so opposite to the schemes and\\npolitics of his imperial majesty, that he could never forgive me.  He\\nmentioned it in a very artful manner at council, where I was told that\\nsome of the wisest appeared, at least by their silence, to be of my\\nopinion; but others, who were my secret enemies, could not forbear some\\nexpressions which, by a side-wind, reflected on me.  And from this time\\nbegan an intrigue between his majesty and a junto of ministers,\\nmaliciously bent against me, which broke out in less than two months, and\\nhad like to have ended in my utter destruction.  Of so little weight are\\nthe greatest services to princes, when put into the balance with a\\nrefusal to gratify their passions.\\n\\nAbout three weeks after this exploit, there arrived a solemn embassy from\\nBlefuscu, with humble offers of a peace, which was soon concluded, upon\\nconditions very advantageous to our emperor, wherewith I shall not\\ntrouble the reader.  There were six ambassadors, with a train of about\\nfive hundred persons, and their entry was very magnificent, suitable to\\nthe grandeur of their master, and the importance of their business.  When\\ntheir treaty was finished, wherein I did them several good offices by the\\ncredit I now had, or at least appeared to have, at court, their\\nexcellencies, who were privately told how much I had been their friend,\\nmade me a visit in form.  They began with many compliments upon my valour\\nand generosity, invited me to that kingdom in the emperor their master’s\\nname, and desired me to show them some proofs of my prodigious strength,\\nof which they had heard so many wonders; wherein I readily obliged them,\\nbut shall not trouble the reader with the particulars.\\n\\nWhen I had for some time entertained their excellencies, to their\\ninfinite satisfaction and surprise, I desired they would do me the honour\\nto present my most humble respects to the emperor their master, the\\nrenown of whose virtues had so justly filled the whole world with\\nadmiration, and whose royal person I resolved to attend, before I\\nreturned to my own country.  Accordingly, the next time I had the honour\\nto see our emperor, I desired his general license to wait on the\\nBlefuscudian monarch, which he was pleased to grant me, as I could\\nperceive, in a very cold manner; but could not guess the reason, till I\\nhad a whisper from a certain person, “that Flimnap and Bolgolam had\\nrepresented my intercourse with those ambassadors as a mark of\\ndisaffection;” from which I am sure my heart was wholly free.  And this\\nwas the first time I began to conceive some imperfect idea of courts and\\nministers.\\n\\nIt is to be observed, that these ambassadors spoke to me, by an\\ninterpreter, the languages of both empires differing as much from each\\nother as any two in Europe, and each nation priding itself upon the\\nantiquity, beauty, and energy of their own tongue, with an avowed\\ncontempt for that of their neighbour; yet our emperor, standing upon the\\nadvantage he had got by the seizure of their fleet, obliged them to\\ndeliver their credentials, and make their speech, in the Lilliputian\\ntongue.  And it must be confessed, that from the great intercourse of\\ntrade and commerce between both realms, from the continual reception of\\nexiles which is mutual among them, and from the custom, in each empire,\\nto send their young nobility and richer gentry to the other, in order to\\npolish themselves by seeing the world, and understanding men and manners;\\nthere are few persons of distinction, or merchants, or seamen, who dwell\\nin the maritime parts, but what can hold conversation in both tongues; as\\nI found some weeks after, when I went to pay my respects to the emperor\\nof Blefuscu, which, in the midst of great misfortunes, through the malice\\nof my enemies, proved a very happy adventure to me, as I shall relate in\\nits proper place.\\n\\nThe reader may remember, that when I signed those articles upon which I\\nrecovered my liberty, there were some which I disliked, upon account of\\ntheir being too servile; neither could anything but an extreme necessity\\nhave forced me to submit.  But being now a _nardac_ of the highest rank\\nin that empire, such offices were looked upon as below my dignity, and\\nthe emperor (to do him justice), never once mentioned them to me.\\nHowever, it was not long before I had an opportunity of doing his\\nmajesty, at least as I then thought, a most signal service.  I was\\nalarmed at midnight with the cries of many hundred people at my door; by\\nwhich, being suddenly awaked, I was in some kind of terror.  I heard the\\nword _Burglum_ repeated incessantly: several of the emperor’s court,\\nmaking their way through the crowd, entreated me to come immediately to\\nthe palace, where her imperial majesty’s apartment was on fire, by the\\ncarelessness of a maid of honour, who fell asleep while she was reading a\\nromance.  I got up in an instant; and orders being given to clear the way\\nbefore me, and it being likewise a moonshine night, I made a shift to get\\nto the palace without trampling on any of the people.  I found they had\\nalready applied ladders to the walls of the apartment, and were well\\nprovided with buckets, but the water was at some distance.  These buckets\\nwere about the size of large thimbles, and the poor people supplied me\\nwith them as fast as they could: but the flame was so violent that they\\ndid little good.  I might easily have stifled it with my coat, which I\\nunfortunately left behind me for haste, and came away only in my leathern\\njerkin.  The case seemed wholly desperate and deplorable; and this\\nmagnificent palace would have infallibly been burnt down to the ground,\\nif, by a presence of mind unusual to me, I had not suddenly thought of an\\nexpedient.  I had, the evening before, drunk plentifully of a most\\ndelicious wine called _glimigrim_, (the Blefuscudians call it _flunec_,\\nbut ours is esteemed the better sort,) which is very diuretic.  By the\\nluckiest chance in the world, I had not discharged myself of any part of\\nit.  The heat I had contracted by coming very near the flames, and by\\nlabouring to quench them, made the wine begin to operate by urine; which\\nI voided in such a quantity, and applied so well to the proper places,\\nthat in three minutes the fire was wholly extinguished, and the rest of\\nthat noble pile, which had cost so many ages in erecting, preserved from\\ndestruction.\\n\\nIt was now day-light, and I returned to my house without waiting to\\ncongratulate with the emperor: because, although I had done a very\\neminent piece of service, yet I could not tell how his majesty might\\nresent the manner by which I had performed it: for, by the fundamental\\nlaws of the realm, it is capital in any person, of what quality soever,\\nto make water within the precincts of the palace.  But I was a little\\ncomforted by a message from his majesty, “that he would give orders to\\nthe grand justiciary for passing my pardon in form:” which, however, I\\ncould not obtain; and I was privately assured, “that the empress,\\nconceiving the greatest abhorrence of what I had done, removed to the\\nmost distant side of the court, firmly resolved that those buildings\\nshould never be repaired for her use: and, in the presence of her chief\\nconfidents could not forbear vowing revenge.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\n\\nOf the inhabitants of Lilliput; their learning, laws, and customs; the\\nmanner of educating their children.  The author’s way of living in that\\ncountry.  His vindication of a great lady.\\n\\nAlthough I intend to leave the description of this empire to a particular\\ntreatise, yet, in the mean time, I am content to gratify the curious\\nreader with some general ideas.  As the common size of the natives is\\nsomewhat under six inches high, so there is an exact proportion in all\\nother animals, as well as plants and trees: for instance, the tallest\\nhorses and oxen are between four and five inches in height, the sheep an\\ninch and half, more or less: their geese about the bigness of a sparrow,\\nand so the several gradations downwards till you come to the smallest,\\nwhich to my sight, were almost invisible; but nature has adapted the eyes\\nof the Lilliputians to all objects proper for their view: they see with\\ngreat exactness, but at no great distance.  And, to show the sharpness of\\ntheir sight towards objects that are near, I have been much pleased with\\nobserving a cook pulling a lark, which was not so large as a common fly;\\nand a young girl threading an invisible needle with invisible silk.\\nTheir tallest trees are about seven feet high: I mean some of those in\\nthe great royal park, the tops whereof I could but just reach with my\\nfist clenched.  The other vegetables are in the same proportion; but this\\nI leave to the reader’s imagination.\\n\\nI shall say but little at present of their learning, which, for many\\nages, has flourished in all its branches among them: but their manner of\\nwriting is very peculiar, being neither from the left to the right, like\\nthe Europeans, nor from the right to the left, like the Arabians, nor\\nfrom up to down, like the Chinese, but aslant, from one corner of the\\npaper to the other, like ladies in England.\\n\\nThey bury their dead with their heads directly downward, because they\\nhold an opinion, that in eleven thousand moons they are all to rise\\nagain; in which period the earth (which they conceive to be flat) will\\nturn upside down, and by this means they shall, at their resurrection, be\\nfound ready standing on their feet.  The learned among them confess the\\nabsurdity of this doctrine; but the practice still continues, in\\ncompliance to the vulgar.\\n\\nThere are some laws and customs in this empire very peculiar; and if they\\nwere not so directly contrary to those of my own dear country, I should\\nbe tempted to say a little in their justification.  It is only to be\\nwished they were as well executed.  The first I shall mention, relates to\\ninformers.  All crimes against the state, are punished here with the\\nutmost severity; but, if the person accused makes his innocence plainly\\nto appear upon his trial, the accuser is immediately put to an\\nignominious death; and out of his goods or lands the innocent person is\\nquadruply recompensed for the loss of his time, for the danger he\\nunderwent, for the hardship of his imprisonment, and for all the charges\\nhe has been at in making his defence; or, if that fund be deficient, it\\nis largely supplied by the crown.  The emperor also confers on him some\\npublic mark of his favour, and proclamation is made of his innocence\\nthrough the whole city.\\n\\nThey look upon fraud as a greater crime than theft, and therefore seldom\\nfail to punish it with death; for they allege, that care and vigilance,\\nwith a very common understanding, may preserve a man’s goods from\\nthieves, but honesty has no defence against superior cunning; and, since\\nit is necessary that there should be a perpetual intercourse of buying\\nand selling, and dealing upon credit, where fraud is permitted and\\nconnived at, or has no law to punish it, the honest dealer is always\\nundone, and the knave gets the advantage.  I remember, when I was once\\ninterceding with the emperor for a criminal who had wronged his master of\\na great sum of money, which he had received by order and ran away with;\\nand happening to tell his majesty, by way of extenuation, that it was\\nonly a breach of trust, the emperor thought it monstrous in me to offer\\nas a defence the greatest aggravation of the crime; and truly I had\\nlittle to say in return, farther than the common answer, that different\\nnations had different customs; for, I confess, I was heartily ashamed.\\n{330}\\n\\nAlthough we usually call reward and punishment the two hinges upon which\\nall government turns, yet I could never observe this maxim to be put in\\npractice by any nation except that of Lilliput.  Whoever can there bring\\nsufficient proof, that he has strictly observed the laws of his country\\nfor seventy-three moons, has a claim to certain privileges, according to\\nhis quality or condition of life, with a proportionable sum of money out\\nof a fund appropriated for that use: he likewise acquires the title of\\n_snilpall_, or legal, which is added to his name, but does not descend to\\nhis posterity.  And these people thought it a prodigious defect of policy\\namong us, when I told them that our laws were enforced only by penalties,\\nwithout any mention of reward.  It is upon this account that the image of\\nJustice, in their courts of judicature, is formed with six eyes, two\\nbefore, as many behind, and on each side one, to signify circumspection;\\nwith a bag of gold open in her right hand, and a sword sheathed in her\\nleft, to show she is more disposed to reward than to punish.\\n\\nIn choosing persons for all employments, they have more regard to good\\nmorals than to great abilities; for, since government is necessary to\\nmankind, they believe, that the common size of human understanding is\\nfitted to some station or other; and that Providence never intended to\\nmake the management of public affairs a mystery to be comprehended only\\nby a few persons of sublime genius, of which there seldom are three born\\nin an age: but they suppose truth, justice, temperance, and the like, to\\nbe in every man’s power; the practice of which virtues, assisted by\\nexperience and a good intention, would qualify any man for the service of\\nhis country, except where a course of study is required.  But they\\nthought the want of moral virtues was so far from being supplied by\\nsuperior endowments of the mind, that employments could never be put into\\nsuch dangerous hands as those of persons so qualified; and, at least,\\nthat the mistakes committed by ignorance, in a virtuous disposition,\\nwould never be of such fatal consequence to the public weal, as the\\npractices of a man, whose inclinations led him to be corrupt, and who had\\ngreat abilities to manage, to multiply, and defend his corruptions.\\n\\nIn like manner, the disbelief of a Divine Providence renders a man\\nincapable of holding any public station; for, since kings avow themselves\\nto be the deputies of Providence, the Lilliputians think nothing can be\\nmore absurd than for a prince to employ such men as disown the authority\\nunder which he acts.\\n\\nIn relating these and the following laws, I would only be understood to\\nmean the original institutions, and not the most scandalous corruptions,\\ninto which these people are fallen by the degenerate nature of man.  For,\\nas to that infamous practice of acquiring great employments by dancing on\\nthe ropes, or badges of favour and distinction by leaping over sticks and\\ncreeping under them, the reader is to observe, that they were first\\nintroduced by the grandfather of the emperor now reigning, and grew to\\nthe present height by the gradual increase of party and faction.\\n\\nIngratitude is among them a capital crime, as we read it to have been in\\nsome other countries: for they reason thus; that whoever makes ill\\nreturns to his benefactor, must needs be a common enemy to the rest of\\nmankind, from whom he has received no obligation, and therefore such a\\nman is not fit to live.\\n\\nTheir notions relating to the duties of parents and children differ\\nextremely from ours.  For, since the conjunction of male and female is\\nfounded upon the great law of nature, in order to propagate and continue\\nthe species, the Lilliputians will needs have it, that men and women are\\njoined together, like other animals, by the motives of concupiscence; and\\nthat their tenderness towards their young proceeds from the like natural\\nprinciple: for which reason they will never allow that a child is under\\nany obligation to his father for begetting him, or to his mother for\\nbringing him into the world; which, considering the miseries of human\\nlife, was neither a benefit in itself, nor intended so by his parents,\\nwhose thoughts, in their love encounters, were otherwise employed.  Upon\\nthese, and the like reasonings, their opinion is, that parents are the\\nlast of all others to be trusted with the education of their own\\nchildren; and therefore they have in every town public nurseries, where\\nall parents, except cottagers and labourers, are obliged to send their\\ninfants of both sexes to be reared and educated, when they come to the\\nage of twenty moons, at which time they are supposed to have some\\nrudiments of docility.  These schools are of several kinds, suited to\\ndifferent qualities, and both sexes.  They have certain professors well\\nskilled in preparing children for such a condition of life as befits the\\nrank of their parents, and their own capacities, as well as inclinations.\\nI shall first say something of the male nurseries, and then of the\\nfemale.\\n\\nThe nurseries for males of noble or eminent birth, are provided with\\ngrave and learned professors, and their several deputies.  The clothes\\nand food of the children are plain and simple.  They are bred up in the\\nprinciples of honour, justice, courage, modesty, clemency, religion, and\\nlove of their country; they are always employed in some business, except\\nin the times of eating and sleeping, which are very short, and two hours\\nfor diversions consisting of bodily exercises.  They are dressed by men\\ntill four years of age, and then are obliged to dress themselves,\\nalthough their quality be ever so great; and the women attendant, who are\\naged proportionably to ours at fifty, perform only the most menial\\noffices.  They are never suffered to converse with servants, but go\\ntogether in smaller or greater numbers to take their diversions, and\\nalways in the presence of a professor, or one of his deputies; whereby\\nthey avoid those early bad impressions of folly and vice, to which our\\nchildren are subject.  Their parents are suffered to see them only twice\\na year; the visit is to last but an hour; they are allowed to kiss the\\nchild at meeting and parting; but a professor, who always stands by on\\nthose occasions, will not suffer them to whisper, or use any fondling\\nexpressions, or bring any presents of toys, sweetmeats, and the like.\\n\\nThe pension from each family for the education and entertainment of a\\nchild, upon failure of due payment, is levied by the emperor’s officers.\\n\\nThe nurseries for children of ordinary gentlemen, merchants, traders, and\\nhandicrafts, are managed proportionably after the same manner; only those\\ndesigned for trades are put out apprentices at eleven years old, whereas\\nthose of persons of quality continue in their exercises till fifteen,\\nwhich answers to twenty-one with us: but the confinement is gradually\\nlessened for the last three years.\\n\\nIn the female nurseries, the young girls of quality are educated much\\nlike the males, only they are dressed by orderly servants of their own\\nsex; but always in the presence of a professor or deputy, till they come\\nto dress themselves, which is at five years old.  And if it be found that\\nthese nurses ever presume to entertain the girls with frightful or\\nfoolish stories, or the common follies practised by chambermaids among\\nus, they are publicly whipped thrice about the city, imprisoned for a\\nyear, and banished for life to the most desolate part of the country.\\nThus the young ladies are as much ashamed of being cowards and fools as\\nthe men, and despise all personal ornaments, beyond decency and\\ncleanliness: neither did I perceive any difference in their education\\nmade by their difference of sex, only that the exercises of the females\\nwere not altogether so robust; and that some rules were given them\\nrelating to domestic life, and a smaller compass of learning was enjoined\\nthem: for their maxim is, that among peoples of quality, a wife should be\\nalways a reasonable and agreeable companion, because she cannot always be\\nyoung.  When the girls are twelve years old, which among them is the\\nmarriageable age, their parents or guardians take them home, with great\\nexpressions of gratitude to the professors, and seldom without tears of\\nthe young lady and her companions.\\n\\nIn the nurseries of females of the meaner sort, the children are\\ninstructed in all kinds of works proper for their sex, and their several\\ndegrees: those intended for apprentices are dismissed at seven years old,\\nthe rest are kept to eleven.\\n\\nThe meaner families who have children at these nurseries, are obliged,\\nbesides their annual pension, which is as low as possible, to return to\\nthe steward of the nursery a small monthly share of their gettings, to be\\na portion for the child; and therefore all parents are limited in their\\nexpenses by the law.  For the Lilliputians think nothing can be more\\nunjust, than for people, in subservience to their own appetites, to bring\\nchildren into the world, and leave the burthen of supporting them on the\\npublic.  As to persons of quality, they give security to appropriate a\\ncertain sum for each child, suitable to their condition; and these funds\\nare always managed with good husbandry and the most exact justice.\\n\\nThe cottagers and labourers keep their children at home, their business\\nbeing only to till and cultivate the earth, and therefore their education\\nis of little consequence to the public: but the old and diseased among\\nthem, are supported by hospitals; for begging is a trade unknown in this\\nempire.\\n\\nAnd here it may, perhaps, divert the curious reader, to give some account\\nof my domestics, and my manner of living in this country, during a\\nresidence of nine months, and thirteen days.  Having a head mechanically\\nturned, and being likewise forced by necessity, I had made for myself a\\ntable and chair convenient enough, out of the largest trees in the royal\\npark.  Two hundred sempstresses were employed to make me shirts, and\\nlinen for my bed and table, all of the strongest and coarsest kind they\\ncould get; which, however, they were forced to quilt together in several\\nfolds, for the thickest was some degrees finer than lawn.  Their linen is\\nusually three inches wide, and three feet make a piece.  The sempstresses\\ntook my measure as I lay on the ground, one standing at my neck, and\\nanother at my mid-leg, with a strong cord extended, that each held by the\\nend, while a third measured the length of the cord with a rule of an inch\\nlong.  Then they measured my right thumb, and desired no more; for by a\\nmathematical computation, that twice round the thumb is once round the\\nwrist, and so on to the neck and the waist, and by the help of my old\\nshirt, which I displayed on the ground before them for a pattern, they\\nfitted me exactly.  Three hundred tailors were employed in the same\\nmanner to make me clothes; but they had another contrivance for taking my\\nmeasure.  I kneeled down, and they raised a ladder from the ground to my\\nneck; upon this ladder one of them mounted, and let fall a plumb-line\\nfrom my collar to the floor, which just answered the length of my coat:\\nbut my waist and arms I measured myself.  When my clothes were finished,\\nwhich was done in my house (for the largest of theirs would not have been\\nable to hold them), they looked like the patch-work made by the ladies in\\nEngland, only that mine were all of a colour.\\n\\nI had three hundred cooks to dress my victuals, in little convenient huts\\nbuilt about my house, where they and their families lived, and prepared\\nme two dishes a-piece.  I took up twenty waiters in my hand, and placed\\nthem on the table: a hundred more attended below on the ground, some with\\ndishes of meat, and some with barrels of wine and other liquors slung on\\ntheir shoulders; all which the waiters above drew up, as I wanted, in a\\nvery ingenious manner, by certain cords, as we draw the bucket up a well\\nin Europe.  A dish of their meat was a good mouthful, and a barrel of\\ntheir liquor a reasonable draught.  Their mutton yields to ours, but\\ntheir beef is excellent.  I have had a sirloin so large, that I have been\\nforced to make three bites of it; but this is rare.  My servants were\\nastonished to see me eat it, bones and all, as in our country we do the\\nleg of a lark.  Their geese and turkeys I usually ate at a mouthful, and\\nI confess they far exceed ours.  Of their smaller fowl I could take up\\ntwenty or thirty at the end of my knife.\\n\\nOne day his imperial majesty, being informed of my way of living, desired\\n“that himself and his royal consort, with the young princes of the blood\\nof both sexes, might have the happiness,” as he was pleased to call it,\\n“of dining with me.”  They came accordingly, and I placed them in chairs\\nof state, upon my table, just over against me, with their guards about\\nthem.  Flimnap, the lord high treasurer, attended there likewise with his\\nwhite staff; and I observed he often looked on me with a sour\\ncountenance, which I would not seem to regard, but ate more than usual,\\nin honour to my dear country, as well as to fill the court with\\nadmiration.  I have some private reasons to believe, that this visit from\\nhis majesty gave Flimnap an opportunity of doing me ill offices to his\\nmaster.  That minister had always been my secret enemy, though he\\noutwardly caressed me more than was usual to the moroseness of his\\nnature.  He represented to the emperor “the low condition of his\\ntreasury; that he was forced to take up money at a great discount; that\\nexchequer bills would not circulate under nine per cent. below par; that\\nI had cost his majesty above a million and a half of _sprugs_” (their\\ngreatest gold coin, about the bigness of a spangle) “and, upon the whole,\\nthat it would be advisable in the emperor to take the first fair occasion\\nof dismissing me.”\\n\\nI am here obliged to vindicate the reputation of an excellent lady, who\\nwas an innocent sufferer upon my account.  The treasurer took a fancy to\\nbe jealous of his wife, from the malice of some evil tongues, who\\ninformed him that her grace had taken a violent affection for my person;\\nand the court scandal ran for some time, that she once came privately to\\nmy lodging.  This I solemnly declare to be a most infamous falsehood,\\nwithout any grounds, further than that her grace was pleased to treat me\\nwith all innocent marks of freedom and friendship.  I own she came often\\nto my house, but always publicly, nor ever without three more in the\\ncoach, who were usually her sister and young daughter, and some\\nparticular acquaintance; but this was common to many other ladies of the\\ncourt.  And I still appeal to my servants round, whether they at any time\\nsaw a coach at my door, without knowing what persons were in it.  On\\nthose occasions, when a servant had given me notice, my custom was to go\\nimmediately to the door, and, after paying my respects, to take up the\\ncoach and two horses very carefully in my hands (for, if there were six\\nhorses, the postillion always unharnessed four,) and place them on a\\ntable, where I had fixed a movable rim quite round, of five inches high,\\nto prevent accidents.  And I have often had four coaches and horses at\\nonce on my table, full of company, while I sat in my chair, leaning my\\nface towards them; and when I was engaged with one set, the coachmen\\nwould gently drive the others round my table.  I have passed many an\\nafternoon very agreeably in these conversations.  But I defy the\\ntreasurer, or his two informers (I will name them, and let them make the\\nbest of it) Clustril and Drunlo, to prove that any person ever came to me\\n_incognito_, except the secretary Reldresal, who was sent by express\\ncommand of his imperial majesty, as I have before related.  I should not\\nhave dwelt so long upon this particular, if it had not been a point\\nwherein the reputation of a great lady is so nearly concerned, to say\\nnothing of my own; though I then had the honour to be a _nardac_, which\\nthe treasurer himself is not; for all the world knows, that he is only a\\n_glumglum_, a title inferior by one degree, as that of a marquis is to a\\nduke in England; yet I allow he preceded me in right of his post.  These\\nfalse informations, which I afterwards came to the knowledge of by an\\naccident not proper to mention, made the treasurer show his lady for some\\ntime an ill countenance, and me a worse; and although he was at last\\nundeceived and reconciled to her, yet I lost all credit with him, and\\nfound my interest decline very fast with the emperor himself, who was,\\nindeed, too much governed by that favourite.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\n\\nThe author, being informed of a design to accuse him of high-treason,\\nmakes his escape to Blefuscu.  His reception there.\\n\\nBefore I proceed to give an account of my leaving this kingdom, it may be\\nproper to inform the reader of a private intrigue which had been for two\\nmonths forming against me.\\n\\nI had been hitherto, all my life, a stranger to courts, for which I was\\nunqualified by the meanness of my condition.  I had indeed heard and read\\nenough of the dispositions of great princes and ministers, but never\\nexpected to have found such terrible effects of them, in so remote a\\ncountry, governed, as I thought, by very different maxims from those in\\nEurope.\\n\\nWhen I was just preparing to pay my attendance on the emperor of\\nBlefuscu, a considerable person at court (to whom I had been very\\nserviceable, at a time when he lay under the highest displeasure of his\\nimperial majesty) came to my house very privately at night, in a close\\nchair, and, without sending his name, desired admittance.  The chairmen\\nwere dismissed; I put the chair, with his lordship in it, into my\\ncoat-pocket: and, giving orders to a trusty servant, to say I was\\nindisposed and gone to sleep, I fastened the door of my house, placed the\\nchair on the table, according to my usual custom, and sat down by it.\\nAfter the common salutations were over, observing his lordship’s\\ncountenance full of concern, and inquiring into the reason, he desired “I\\nwould hear him with patience, in a matter that highly concerned my honour\\nand my life.”  His speech was to the following effect, for I took notes\\nof it as soon as he left me:—\\n\\n“You are to know,” said he, “that several committees of council have been\\nlately called, in the most private manner, on your account; and it is but\\ntwo days since his majesty came to a full resolution.\\n\\n“You are very sensible that Skyresh Bolgolam” (_galbet_, or high-admiral)\\n“has been your mortal enemy, almost ever since your arrival.  His\\noriginal reasons I know not; but his hatred is increased since your great\\nsuccess against Blefuscu, by which his glory as admiral is much obscured.\\nThis lord, in conjunction with Flimnap the high-treasurer, whose enmity\\nagainst you is notorious on account of his lady, Limtoc the general,\\nLalcon the chamberlain, and Balmuff the grand justiciary, have prepared\\narticles of impeachment against you, for treason and other capital\\ncrimes.”\\n\\nThis preface made me so impatient, being conscious of my own merits and\\ninnocence, that I was going to interrupt him; when he entreated me to be\\nsilent, and thus proceeded:—\\n\\n“Out of gratitude for the favours you have done me, I procured\\ninformation of the whole proceedings, and a copy of the articles; wherein\\nI venture my head for your service.\\n\\n    “‘_Articles of Impeachment against_ QUINBUS FLESTRIN, (_the\\n    Man-Mountain_.)\\n\\n    ARTICLE I.\\n\\n    “‘Whereas, by a statute made in the reign of his imperial majesty\\n    Calin Deffar Plune, it is enacted, that, whoever shall make water\\n    within the precincts of the royal palace, shall be liable to the\\n    pains and penalties of high-treason; notwithstanding, the said\\n    Quinbus Flestrin, in open breach of the said law, under colour of\\n    extinguishing the fire kindled in the apartment of his majesty’s most\\n    dear imperial consort, did maliciously, traitorously, and devilishly,\\n    by discharge of his urine, put out the said fire kindled in the said\\n    apartment, lying and being within the precincts of the said royal\\n    palace, against the statute in that case provided, etc. against the\\n    duty, etc.\\n\\n    ARTICLE II.\\n\\n    “‘That the said Quinbus Flestrin, having brought the imperial fleet\\n    of Blefuscu into the royal port, and being afterwards commanded by\\n    his imperial majesty to seize all the other ships of the said empire\\n    of Blefuscu, and reduce that empire to a province, to be governed by\\n    a viceroy from hence, and to destroy and put to death, not only all\\n    the Big-endian exiles, but likewise all the people of that empire who\\n    would not immediately forsake the Big-endian heresy, he, the said\\n    Flestrin, like a false traitor against his most auspicious, serene,\\n    imperial majesty, did petition to be excused from the said service,\\n    upon pretence of unwillingness to force the consciences, or destroy\\n    the liberties and lives of an innocent people.\\n\\n    ARTICLE III.\\n\\n    “‘That, whereas certain ambassadors arrived from the Court of\\n    Blefuscu, to sue for peace in his majesty’s court, he, the said\\n    Flestrin, did, like a false traitor, aid, abet, comfort, and divert,\\n    the said ambassadors, although he knew them to be servants to a\\n    prince who was lately an open enemy to his imperial majesty, and in\\n    an open war against his said majesty.\\n\\n    ARTICLE IV.\\n\\n    “‘That the said Quinbus Flestrin, contrary to the duty of a faithful\\n    subject, is now preparing to make a voyage to the court and empire of\\n    Blefuscu, for which he has received only verbal license from his\\n    imperial majesty; and, under colour of the said license, does falsely\\n    and traitorously intend to take the said voyage, and thereby to aid,\\n    comfort, and abet the emperor of Blefuscu, so lately an enemy, and in\\n    open war with his imperial majesty aforesaid.’\\n\\n“There are some other articles; but these are the most important, of\\nwhich I have read you an abstract.\\n\\n“In the several debates upon this impeachment, it must be confessed that\\nhis majesty gave many marks of his great lenity; often urging the\\nservices you had done him, and endeavouring to extenuate your crimes.\\nThe treasurer and admiral insisted that you should be put to the most\\npainful and ignominious death, by setting fire to your house at night,\\nand the general was to attend with twenty thousand men, armed with\\npoisoned arrows, to shoot you on the face and hands.  Some of your\\nservants were to have private orders to strew a poisonous juice on your\\nshirts and sheets, which would soon make you tear your own flesh, and die\\nin the utmost torture.  The general came into the same opinion; so that\\nfor a long time there was a majority against you; but his majesty\\nresolving, if possible, to spare your life, at last brought off the\\nchamberlain.\\n\\n“Upon this incident, Reldresal, principal secretary for private affairs,\\nwho always approved himself your true friend, was commanded by the\\nemperor to deliver his opinion, which he accordingly did; and therein\\njustified the good thoughts you have of him.  He allowed your crimes to\\nbe great, but that still there was room for mercy, the most commendable\\nvirtue in a prince, and for which his majesty was so justly celebrated.\\nHe said, the friendship between you and him was so well known to the\\nworld, that perhaps the most honourable board might think him partial;\\nhowever, in obedience to the command he had received, he would freely\\noffer his sentiments.  That if his majesty, in consideration of your\\nservices, and pursuant to his own merciful disposition, would please to\\nspare your life, and only give orders to put out both your eyes, he\\nhumbly conceived, that by this expedient justice might in some measure be\\nsatisfied, and all the world would applaud the lenity of the emperor, as\\nwell as the fair and generous proceedings of those who have the honour to\\nbe his counsellors.  That the loss of your eyes would be no impediment to\\nyour bodily strength, by which you might still be useful to his majesty;\\nthat blindness is an addition to courage, by concealing dangers from us;\\nthat the fear you had for your eyes, was the greatest difficulty in\\nbringing over the enemy’s fleet, and it would be sufficient for you to\\nsee by the eyes of the ministers, since the greatest princes do no more.\\n\\n“This proposal was received with the utmost disapprobation by the whole\\nboard.  Bolgolam, the admiral, could not preserve his temper, but, rising\\nup in fury, said, he wondered how the secretary durst presume to give his\\nopinion for preserving the life of a traitor; that the services you had\\nperformed were, by all true reasons of state, the great aggravation of\\nyour crimes; that you, who were able to extinguish the fire by discharge\\nof urine in her majesty’s apartment (which he mentioned with horror),\\nmight, at another time, raise an inundation by the same means, to drown\\nthe whole palace; and the same strength which enabled you to bring over\\nthe enemy’s fleet, might serve, upon the first discontent, to carry it\\nback; that he had good reasons to think you were a Big-endian in your\\nheart; and, as treason begins in the heart, before it appears in\\novert-acts, so he accused you as a traitor on that account, and therefore\\ninsisted you should be put to death.\\n\\n“The treasurer was of the same opinion: he showed to what straits his\\nmajesty’s revenue was reduced, by the charge of maintaining you, which\\nwould soon grow insupportable; that the secretary’s expedient of putting\\nout your eyes, was so far from being a remedy against this evil, that it\\nwould probably increase it, as is manifest from the common practice of\\nblinding some kind of fowls, after which they fed the faster, and grew\\nsooner fat; that his sacred majesty and the council, who are your judges,\\nwere, in their own consciences, fully convinced of your guilt, which was\\na sufficient argument to condemn you to death, without the formal proofs\\nrequired by the strict letter of the law.\\n\\n“But his imperial majesty, fully determined against capital punishment,\\nwas graciously pleased to say, that since the council thought the loss of\\nyour eyes too easy a censure, some other way may be inflicted hereafter.\\nAnd your friend the secretary, humbly desiring to be heard again, in\\nanswer to what the treasurer had objected, concerning the great charge\\nhis majesty was at in maintaining you, said, that his excellency, who had\\nthe sole disposal of the emperor’s revenue, might easily provide against\\nthat evil, by gradually lessening your establishment; by which, for want\\nof sufficient for you would grow weak and faint, and lose your appetite,\\nand consequently, decay, and consume in a few months; neither would the\\nstench of your carcass be then so dangerous, when it should become more\\nthan half diminished; and immediately upon your death five or six\\nthousand of his majesty’s subjects might, in two or three days, cut your\\nflesh from your bones, take it away by cart-loads, and bury it in distant\\nparts, to prevent infection, leaving the skeleton as a monument of\\nadmiration to posterity.\\n\\n“Thus, by the great friendship of the secretary, the whole affair was\\ncompromised.  It was strictly enjoined, that the project of starving you\\nby degrees should be kept a secret; but the sentence of putting out your\\neyes was entered on the books; none dissenting, except Bolgolam the\\nadmiral, who, being a creature of the empress, was perpetually instigated\\nby her majesty to insist upon your death, she having borne perpetual\\nmalice against you, on account of that infamous and illegal method you\\ntook to extinguish the fire in her apartment.\\n\\n“In three days your friend the secretary will be directed to come to your\\nhouse, and read before you the articles of impeachment; and then to\\nsignify the great lenity and favour of his majesty and council, whereby\\nyou are only condemned to the loss of your eyes, which his majesty does\\nnot question you will gratefully and humbly submit to; and twenty of his\\nmajesty’s surgeons will attend, in order to see the operation well\\nperformed, by discharging very sharp-pointed arrows into the balls of\\nyour eyes, as you lie on the ground.\\n\\n“I leave to your prudence what measures you will take; and to avoid\\nsuspicion, I must immediately return in as private a manner as I came.”\\n\\nHis lordship did so; and I remained alone, under many doubts and\\nperplexities of mind.\\n\\nIt was a custom introduced by this prince and his ministry (very\\ndifferent, as I have been assured, from the practice of former times,)\\nthat after the court had decreed any cruel execution, either to gratify\\nthe monarch’s resentment, or the malice of a favourite, the emperor\\nalways made a speech to his whole council, expressing his great lenity\\nand tenderness, as qualities known and confessed by all the world.  This\\nspeech was immediately published throughout the kingdom; nor did any\\nthing terrify the people so much as those encomiums on his majesty’s\\nmercy; because it was observed, that the more these praises were enlarged\\nand insisted on, the more inhuman was the punishment, and the sufferer\\nmore innocent.  Yet, as to myself, I must confess, having never been\\ndesigned for a courtier, either by my birth or education, I was so ill a\\njudge of things, that I could not discover the lenity and favour of this\\nsentence, but conceived it (perhaps erroneously) rather to be rigorous\\nthan gentle.  I sometimes thought of standing my trial, for, although I\\ncould not deny the facts alleged in the several articles, yet I hoped\\nthey would admit of some extenuation.  But having in my life perused many\\nstate-trials, which I ever observed to terminate as the judges thought\\nfit to direct, I durst not rely on so dangerous a decision, in so\\ncritical a juncture, and against such powerful enemies.  Once I was\\nstrongly bent upon resistance, for, while I had liberty the whole\\nstrength of that empire could hardly subdue me, and I might easily with\\nstones pelt the metropolis to pieces; but I soon rejected that project\\nwith horror, by remembering the oath I had made to the emperor, the\\nfavours I received from him, and the high title of _nardac_ he conferred\\nupon me.  Neither had I so soon learned the gratitude of courtiers, to\\npersuade myself, that his majesty’s present seventies acquitted me of all\\npast obligations.\\n\\nAt last, I fixed upon a resolution, for which it is probable I may incur\\nsome censure, and not unjustly; for I confess I owe the preserving of\\nmine eyes, and consequently my liberty, to my own great rashness and want\\nof experience; because, if I had then known the nature of princes and\\nministers, which I have since observed in many other courts, and their\\nmethods of treating criminals less obnoxious than myself, I should, with\\ngreat alacrity and readiness, have submitted to so easy a punishment.\\nBut hurried on by the precipitancy of youth, and having his imperial\\nmajesty’s license to pay my attendance upon the emperor of Blefuscu, I\\ntook this opportunity, before the three days were elapsed, to send a\\nletter to my friend the secretary, signifying my resolution of setting\\nout that morning for Blefuscu, pursuant to the leave I had got; and,\\nwithout waiting for an answer, I went to that side of the island where\\nour fleet lay.  I seized a large man of war, tied a cable to the prow,\\nand, lifting up the anchors, I stripped myself, put my clothes (together\\nwith my coverlet, which I carried under my arm) into the vessel, and,\\ndrawing it after me, between wading and swimming arrived at the royal\\nport of Blefuscu, where the people had long expected me: they lent me two\\nguides to direct me to the capital city, which is of the same name.  I\\nheld them in my hands, till I came within two hundred yards of the gate,\\nand desired them “to signify my arrival to one of the secretaries, and\\nlet him know, I there waited his majesty’s command.”  I had an answer in\\nabout an hour, “that his majesty, attended by the royal family, and great\\nofficers of the court, was coming out to receive me.”  I advanced a\\nhundred yards.  The emperor and his train alighted from their horses, the\\nempress and ladies from their coaches, and I did not perceive they were\\nin any fright or concern.  I lay on the ground to kiss his majesty’s and\\nthe empress’s hands.  I told his majesty, “that I was come according to\\nmy promise, and with the license of the emperor my master, to have the\\nhonour of seeing so mighty a monarch, and to offer him any service in my\\npower, consistent with my duty to my own prince;” not mentioning a word\\nof my disgrace, because I had hitherto no regular information of it, and\\nmight suppose myself wholly ignorant of any such design; neither could I\\nreasonably conceive that the emperor would discover the secret, while I\\nwas out of his power; wherein, however, it soon appeared I was deceived.\\n\\nI shall not trouble the reader with the particular account of my\\nreception at this court, which was suitable to the generosity of so great\\na prince; nor of the difficulties I was in for want of a house and bed,\\nbeing forced to lie on the ground, wrapped up in my coverlet.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\n\\nThe author, by a lucky accident, finds means to leave Blefuscu; and,\\nafter some difficulties, returns safe to his native country.\\n\\nThree days after my arrival, walking out of curiosity to the north-east\\ncoast of the island, I observed, about half a league off in the sea,\\nsomewhat that looked like a boat overturned.  I pulled off my shoes and\\nstockings, and, wailing two or three hundred yards, I found the object to\\napproach nearer by force of the tide; and then plainly saw it to be a\\nreal boat, which I supposed might by some tempest have been driven from a\\nship.  Whereupon, I returned immediately towards the city, and desired\\nhis imperial majesty to lend me twenty of the tallest vessels he had\\nleft, after the loss of his fleet, and three thousand seamen, under the\\ncommand of his vice-admiral.  This fleet sailed round, while I went back\\nthe shortest way to the coast, where I first discovered the boat.  I\\nfound the tide had driven it still nearer.  The seamen were all provided\\nwith cordage, which I had beforehand twisted to a sufficient strength.\\nWhen the ships came up, I stripped myself, and waded till I came within a\\nhundred yards off the boat, after which I was forced to swim till I got\\nup to it.  The seamen threw me the end of the cord, which I fastened to a\\nhole in the fore-part of the boat, and the other end to a man of war; but\\nI found all my labour to little purpose; for, being out of my depth, I\\nwas not able to work.  In this necessity I was forced to swim behind, and\\npush the boat forward, as often as I could, with one of my hands; and the\\ntide favouring me, I advanced so far that I could just hold up my chin\\nand feel the ground.  I rested two or three minutes, and then gave the\\nboat another shove, and so on, till the sea was no higher than my\\narm-pits; and now, the most laborious part being over, I took out my\\nother cables, which were stowed in one of the ships, and fastened them\\nfirst to the boat, and then to nine of the vessels which attended me; the\\nwind being favourable, the seamen towed, and I shoved, until we arrived\\nwithin forty yards of the shore; and, waiting till the tide was out, I\\ngot dry to the boat, and by the assistance of two thousand men, with\\nropes and engines, I made a shift to turn it on its bottom, and found it\\nwas but little damaged.\\n\\nI shall not trouble the reader with the difficulties I was under, by the\\nhelp of certain paddles, which cost me ten days making, to get my boat to\\nthe royal port of Blefuscu, where a mighty concourse of people appeared\\nupon my arrival, full of wonder at the sight of so prodigious a vessel.\\nI told the emperor “that my good fortune had thrown this boat in my way,\\nto carry me to some place whence I might return into my native country;\\nand begged his majesty’s orders for getting materials to fit it up,\\ntogether with his license to depart;” which, after some kind\\nexpostulations, he was pleased to grant.\\n\\nI did very much wonder, in all this time, not to have heard of any\\nexpress relating to me from our emperor to the court of Blefuscu.  But I\\nwas afterward given privately to understand, that his imperial majesty,\\nnever imagining I had the least notice of his designs, believed I was\\nonly gone to Blefuscu in performance of my promise, according to the\\nlicense he had given me, which was well known at our court, and would\\nreturn in a few days, when the ceremony was ended.  But he was at last in\\npain at my long absence; and after consulting with the treasurer and the\\nrest of that cabal, a person of quality was dispatched with the copy of\\nthe articles against me.  This envoy had instructions to represent to the\\nmonarch of Blefuscu, “the great lenity of his master, who was content to\\npunish me no farther than with the loss of mine eyes; that I had fled\\nfrom justice; and if I did not return in two hours, I should be deprived\\nof my title of _nardac_, and declared a traitor.”  The envoy further\\nadded, “that in order to maintain the peace and amity between both\\nempires, his master expected that his brother of Blefuscu would give\\norders to have me sent back to Lilliput, bound hand and foot, to be\\npunished as a traitor.”\\n\\nThe emperor of Blefuscu, having taken three days to consult, returned an\\nanswer consisting of many civilities and excuses.  He said, “that as for\\nsending me bound, his brother knew it was impossible; that, although I\\nhad deprived him of his fleet, yet he owed great obligations to me for\\nmany good offices I had done him in making the peace.  That, however,\\nboth their majesties would soon be made easy; for I had found a\\nprodigious vessel on the shore, able to carry me on the sea, which he had\\ngiven orders to fit up, with my own assistance and direction; and he\\nhoped, in a few weeks, both empires would be freed from so insupportable\\nan encumbrance.”\\n\\nWith this answer the envoy returned to Lilliput; and the monarch of\\nBlefuscu related to me all that had passed; offering me at the same time\\n(but under the strictest confidence) his gracious protection, if I would\\ncontinue in his service; wherein, although I believed him sincere, yet I\\nresolved never more to put any confidence in princes or ministers, where\\nI could possibly avoid it; and therefore, with all due acknowledgments\\nfor his favourable intentions, I humbly begged to be excused.  I told\\nhim, “that since fortune, whether good or evil, had thrown a vessel in my\\nway, I was resolved to venture myself on the ocean, rather than be an\\noccasion of difference between two such mighty monarchs.”  Neither did I\\nfind the emperor at all displeased; and I discovered, by a certain\\naccident, that he was very glad of my resolution, and so were most of his\\nministers.\\n\\nThese considerations moved me to hasten my departure somewhat sooner than\\nI intended; to which the court, impatient to have me gone, very readily\\ncontributed.  Five hundred workmen were employed to make two sails to my\\nboat, according to my directions, by quilting thirteen folds of their\\nstrongest linen together.  I was at the pains of making ropes and cables,\\nby twisting ten, twenty, or thirty of the thickest and strongest of\\ntheirs.  A great stone that I happened to find, after a long search, by\\nthe sea-shore, served me for an anchor.  I had the tallow of three\\nhundred cows, for greasing my boat, and other uses.  I was at incredible\\npains in cutting down some of the largest timber-trees, for oars and\\nmasts, wherein I was, however, much assisted by his majesty’s\\nship-carpenters, who helped me in smoothing them, after I had done the\\nrough work.\\n\\nIn about a month, when all was prepared, I sent to receive his majesty’s\\ncommands, and to take my leave.  The emperor and royal family came out of\\nthe palace; I lay down on my face to kiss his hand, which he very\\ngraciously gave me: so did the empress and young princes of the blood.\\nHis majesty presented me with fifty purses of two hundred _sprugs_\\na-piece, together with his picture at full length, which I put\\nimmediately into one of my gloves, to keep it from being hurt.  The\\nceremonies at my departure were too many to trouble the reader with at\\nthis time.\\n\\nI stored the boat with the carcases of a hundred oxen, and three hundred\\nsheep, with bread and drink proportionable, and as much meat ready\\ndressed as four hundred cooks could provide.  I took with me six cows and\\ntwo bulls alive, with as many ewes and rams, intending to carry them into\\nmy own country, and propagate the breed.  And to feed them on board, I\\nhad a good bundle of hay, and a bag of corn.  I would gladly have taken a\\ndozen of the natives, but this was a thing the emperor would by no means\\npermit; and, besides a diligent search into my pockets, his majesty\\nengaged my honour “not to carry away any of his subjects, although with\\ntheir own consent and desire.”\\n\\nHaving thus prepared all things as well as I was able, I set sail on the\\ntwenty-fourth day of September 1701, at six in the morning; and when I\\nhad gone about four-leagues to the northward, the wind being at\\nsouth-east, at six in the evening I descried a small island, about half a\\nleague to the north-west.  I advanced forward, and cast anchor on the\\nlee-side of the island, which seemed to be uninhabited.  I then took some\\nrefreshment, and went to my rest.  I slept well, and as I conjectured at\\nleast six hours, for I found the day broke in two hours after I awaked.\\nIt was a clear night.  I ate my breakfast before the sun was up; and\\nheaving anchor, the wind being favourable, I steered the same course that\\nI had done the day before, wherein I was directed by my pocket compass.\\nMy intention was to reach, if possible, one of those islands which I had\\nreason to believe lay to the north-east of Van Diemen’s Land.  I\\ndiscovered nothing all that day; but upon the next, about three in the\\nafternoon, when I had by my computation made twenty-four leagues from\\nBlefuscu, I descried a sail steering to the south-east; my course was due\\neast.  I hailed her, but could get no answer; yet I found I gained upon\\nher, for the wind slackened.  I made all the sail I could, and in half an\\nhour she spied me, then hung out her ancient, and discharged a gun.  It\\nis not easy to express the joy I was in, upon the unexpected hope of once\\nmore seeing my beloved country, and the dear pledges I left in it.  The\\nship slackened her sails, and I came up with her between five and six in\\nthe evening, September 26th; but my heart leaped within me to see her\\nEnglish colours.  I put my cows and sheep into my coat-pockets, and got\\non board with all my little cargo of provisions.  The vessel was an\\nEnglish merchantman, returning from Japan by the North and South seas;\\nthe captain, Mr. John Biddel, of Deptford, a very civil man, and an\\nexcellent sailor.\\n\\nWe were now in the latitude of 30 degrees south; there were about fifty\\nmen in the ship; and here I met an old comrade of mine, one Peter\\nWilliams, who gave me a good character to the captain.  This gentleman\\ntreated me with kindness, and desired I would let him know what place I\\ncame from last, and whither I was bound; which I did in a few words, but\\nhe thought I was raving, and that the dangers I underwent had disturbed\\nmy head; whereupon I took my black cattle and sheep out of my pocket,\\nwhich, after great astonishment, clearly convinced him of my veracity.  I\\nthen showed him the gold given me by the emperor of Blefuscu, together\\nwith his majesty’s picture at full length, and some other rarities of\\nthat country.  I gave him two purses of two hundreds _sprugs_ each, and\\npromised, when we arrived in England, to make him a present of a cow and\\na sheep big with young.\\n\\nI shall not trouble the reader with a particular account of this voyage,\\nwhich was very prosperous for the most part.  We arrived in the Downs on\\nthe 13th of April, 1702.  I had only one misfortune, that the rats on\\nboard carried away one of my sheep; I found her bones in a hole, picked\\nclean from the flesh.  The rest of my cattle I got safe ashore, and set\\nthem a-grazing in a bowling-green at Greenwich, where the fineness of the\\ngrass made them feed very heartily, though I had always feared the\\ncontrary: neither could I possibly have preserved them in so long a\\nvoyage, if the captain had not allowed me some of his best biscuit,\\nwhich, rubbed to powder, and mingled with water, was their constant food.\\nThe short time I continued in England, I made a considerable profit by\\nshowing my cattle to many persons of quality and others: and before I\\nbegan my second voyage, I sold them for six hundred pounds.  Since my\\nlast return I find the breed is considerably increased, especially the\\nsheep, which I hope will prove much to the advantage of the woollen\\nmanufacture, by the fineness of the fleeces.\\n\\nI stayed but two months with my wife and family, for my insatiable desire\\nof seeing foreign countries, would suffer me to continue no longer.  I\\nleft fifteen hundred pounds with my wife, and fixed her in a good house\\nat Redriff.  My remaining stock I carried with me, part in money and part\\nin goods, in hopes to improve my fortunes.  My eldest uncle John had left\\nme an estate in land, near Epping, of about thirty pounds a-year; and I\\nhad a long lease of the Black Bull in Fetter-Lane, which yielded me as\\nmuch more; so that I was not in any danger of leaving my family upon the\\nparish.  My son Johnny, named so after his uncle, was at the\\ngrammar-school, and a towardly child.  My daughter Betty (who is now well\\nmarried, and has children) was then at her needle-work.  I took leave of\\nmy wife, and boy and girl, with tears on both sides, and went on board\\nthe Adventure, a merchant ship of three hundred tons, bound for Surat,\\ncaptain John Nicholas, of Liverpool, commander.  But my account of this\\nvoyage must be referred to the Second Part of my Travels.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART II.  A VOYAGE TO BROBDINGNAG.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\n\\n\\nA great storm described; the long boat sent to fetch water; the author\\ngoes with it to discover the country.  He is left on shore, is seized by\\none of the natives, and carried to a farmer’s house.  His reception, with\\nseveral accidents that happened there.  A description of the inhabitants.\\n\\nHaving been condemned, by nature and fortune, to active and restless\\nlife, in two months after my return, I again left my native country, and\\ntook shipping in the Downs, on the 20th day of June, 1702, in the\\nAdventure, Captain John Nicholas, a Cornish man, commander, bound for\\nSurat.  We had a very prosperous gale, till we arrived at the Cape of\\nGood Hope, where we landed for fresh water; but discovering a leak, we\\nunshipped our goods and wintered there; for the captain falling sick of\\nan ague, we could not leave the Cape till the end of March.  We then set\\nsail, and had a good voyage till we passed the Straits of Madagascar; but\\nhaving got northward of that island, and to about five degrees south\\nlatitude, the winds, which in those seas are observed to blow a constant\\nequal gale between the north and west, from the beginning of December to\\nthe beginning of May, on the 19th of April began to blow with much\\ngreater violence, and more westerly than usual, continuing so for twenty\\ndays together: during which time, we were driven a little to the east of\\nthe Molucca Islands, and about three degrees northward of the line, as\\nour captain found by an observation he took the 2nd of May, at which time\\nthe wind ceased, and it was a perfect calm, whereat I was not a little\\nrejoiced.  But he, being a man well experienced in the navigation of\\nthose seas, bid us all prepare against a storm, which accordingly\\nhappened the day following: for the southern wind, called the southern\\nmonsoon, began to set in.\\n\\nFinding it was likely to overblow, we took in our sprit-sail, and stood\\nby to hand the fore-sail; but making foul weather, we looked the guns\\nwere all fast, and handed the mizen.  The ship lay very broad off, so we\\nthought it better spooning before the sea, than trying or hulling.  We\\nreefed the fore-sail and set him, and hauled aft the fore-sheet; the helm\\nwas hard a-weather.  The ship wore bravely.  We belayed the fore\\ndown-haul; but the sail was split, and we hauled down the yard, and got\\nthe sail into the ship, and unbound all the things clear of it.  It was a\\nvery fierce storm; the sea broke strange and dangerous.  We hauled off\\nupon the laniard of the whip-staff, and helped the man at the helm.  We\\nwould not get down our topmast, but let all stand, because she scudded\\nbefore the sea very well, and we knew that the top-mast being aloft, the\\nship was the wholesomer, and made better way through the sea, seeing we\\nhad sea-room.  When the storm was over, we set fore-sail and main-sail,\\nand brought the ship to.  Then we set the mizen, main-top-sail, and the\\nfore-top-sail.  Our course was east-north-east, the wind was at\\nsouth-west.  We got the starboard tacks aboard, we cast off our\\nweather-braces and lifts; we set in the lee-braces, and hauled forward by\\nthe weather-bowlings, and hauled them tight, and belayed them, and hauled\\nover the mizen tack to windward, and kept her full and by as near as she\\nwould lie.\\n\\nDuring this storm, which was followed by a strong wind west-south-west,\\nwe were carried, by my computation, about five hundred leagues to the\\neast, so that the oldest sailor on board could not tell in what part of\\nthe world we were.  Our provisions held out well, our ship was staunch,\\nand our crew all in good health; but we lay in the utmost distress for\\nwater.  We thought it best to hold on the same course, rather than turn\\nmore northerly, which might have brought us to the north-west part of\\nGreat Tartary, and into the Frozen Sea.\\n\\nOn the 16th day of June, 1703, a boy on the top-mast discovered land.  On\\nthe 17th, we came in full view of a great island, or continent (for we\\nknew not whether;) on the south side whereof was a small neck of land\\njutting out into the sea, and a creek too shallow to hold a ship of above\\none hundred tons.  We cast anchor within a league of this creek, and our\\ncaptain sent a dozen of his men well armed in the long-boat, with vessels\\nfor water, if any could be found.  I desired his leave to go with them,\\nthat I might see the country, and make what discoveries I could.  When we\\ncame to land we saw no river or spring, nor any sign of inhabitants.  Our\\nmen therefore wandered on the shore to find out some fresh water near the\\nsea, and I walked alone about a mile on the other side, where I observed\\nthe country all barren and rocky.  I now began to be weary, and seeing\\nnothing to entertain my curiosity, I returned gently down towards the\\ncreek; and the sea being full in my view, I saw our men already got into\\nthe boat, and rowing for life to the ship.  I was going to holla after\\nthem, although it had been to little purpose, when I observed a huge\\ncreature walking after them in the sea, as fast as he could: he waded not\\nmuch deeper than his knees, and took prodigious strides: but our men had\\nthe start of him half a league, and, the sea thereabouts being full of\\nsharp-pointed rocks, the monster was not able to overtake the boat.  This\\nI was afterwards told, for I durst not stay to see the issue of the\\nadventure; but ran as fast as I could the way I first went, and then\\nclimbed up a steep hill, which gave me some prospect of the country.  I\\nfound it fully cultivated; but that which first surprised me was the\\nlength of the grass, which, in those grounds that seemed to be kept for\\nhay, was about twenty feet high.\\n\\nI fell into a high road, for so I took it to be, though it served to the\\ninhabitants only as a foot-path through a field of barley.  Here I walked\\non for some time, but could see little on either side, it being now near\\nharvest, and the corn rising at least forty feet.  I was an hour walking\\nto the end of this field, which was fenced in with a hedge of at least\\none hundred and twenty feet high, and the trees so lofty that I could\\nmake no computation of their altitude.  There was a stile to pass from\\nthis field into the next.  It had four steps, and a stone to cross over\\nwhen you came to the uppermost.  It was impossible for me to climb this\\nstile, because every step was six-feet high, and the upper stone about\\ntwenty.  I was endeavouring to find some gap in the hedge, when I\\ndiscovered one of the inhabitants in the next field, advancing towards\\nthe stile, of the same size with him whom I saw in the sea pursuing our\\nboat.  He appeared as tall as an ordinary spire steeple, and took about\\nten yards at every stride, as near as I could guess.  I was struck with\\nthe utmost fear and astonishment, and ran to hide myself in the corn,\\nwhence I saw him at the top of the stile looking back into the next field\\non the right hand, and heard him call in a voice many degrees louder than\\na speaking-trumpet: but the noise was so high in the air, that at first I\\ncertainly thought it was thunder.  Whereupon seven monsters, like\\nhimself, came towards him with reaping-hooks in their hands, each hook\\nabout the largeness of six scythes.  These people were not so well clad\\nas the first, whose servants or labourers they seemed to be; for, upon\\nsome words he spoke, they went to reap the corn in the field where I lay.\\nI kept from them at as great a distance as I could, but was forced to\\nmove with extreme difficulty, for the stalks of the corn were sometimes\\nnot above a foot distant, so that I could hardly squeeze my body betwixt\\nthem.  However, I made a shift to go forward, till I came to a part of\\nthe field where the corn had been laid by the rain and wind.  Here it was\\nimpossible for me to advance a step; for the stalks were so interwoven,\\nthat I could not creep through, and the beards of the fallen ears so\\nstrong and pointed, that they pierced through my clothes into my flesh.\\nAt the same time I heard the reapers not a hundred yards behind me.\\nBeing quite dispirited with toil, and wholly overcome by grief and\\ndispair, I lay down between two ridges, and heartily wished I might there\\nend my days.  I bemoaned my desolate widow and fatherless children.  I\\nlamented my own folly and wilfulness, in attempting a second voyage,\\nagainst the advice of all my friends and relations.  In this terrible\\nagitation of mind, I could not forbear thinking of Lilliput, whose\\ninhabitants looked upon me as the greatest prodigy that ever appeared in\\nthe world; where I was able to draw an imperial fleet in my hand, and\\nperform those other actions, which will be recorded for ever in the\\nchronicles of that empire, while posterity shall hardly believe them,\\nalthough attested by millions.  I reflected what a mortification it must\\nprove to me, to appear as inconsiderable in this nation, as one single\\nLilliputian would be among us.  But this I conceived was to be the least\\nof my misfortunes; for, as human creatures are observed to be more savage\\nand cruel in proportion to their bulk, what could I expect but to be a\\nmorsel in the mouth of the first among these enormous barbarians that\\nshould happen to seize me?  Undoubtedly philosophers are in the right,\\nwhen they tell us that nothing is great or little otherwise than by\\ncomparison.  It might have pleased fortune, to have let the Lilliputians\\nfind some nation, where the people were as diminutive with respect to\\nthem, as they were to me.  And who knows but that even this prodigious\\nrace of mortals might be equally overmatched in some distant part of the\\nworld, whereof we have yet no discovery.\\n\\nScared and confounded as I was, I could not forbear going on with these\\nreflections, when one of the reapers, approaching within ten yards of the\\nridge where I lay, made me apprehend that with the next step I should be\\nsquashed to death under his foot, or cut in two with his reaping-hook.\\nAnd therefore, when he was again about to move, I screamed as loud as\\nfear could make me: whereupon the huge creature trod short, and, looking\\nround about under him for some time, at last espied me as I lay on the\\nground.  He considered awhile, with the caution of one who endeavours to\\nlay hold on a small dangerous animal in such a manner that it shall not\\nbe able either to scratch or bite him, as I myself have sometimes done\\nwith a weasel in England.  At length he ventured to take me behind, by\\nthe middle, between his fore-finger and thumb, and brought me within\\nthree yards of his eyes, that he might behold my shape more perfectly.  I\\nguessed his meaning, and my good fortune gave me so much presence of\\nmind, that I resolved not to struggle in the least as he held me in the\\nair above sixty feet from the ground, although he grievously pinched my\\nsides, for fear I should slip through his fingers.  All I ventured was to\\nraise mine eyes towards the sun, and place my hands together in a\\nsupplicating posture, and to speak some words in a humble melancholy\\ntone, suitable to the condition I then was in: for I apprehended every\\nmoment that he would dash me against the ground, as we usually do any\\nlittle hateful animal, which we have a mind to destroy.  But my good star\\nwould have it, that he appeared pleased with my voice and gestures, and\\nbegan to look upon me as a curiosity, much wondering to hear me pronounce\\narticulate words, although he could not understand them.  In the mean\\ntime I was not able to forbear groaning and shedding tears, and turning\\nmy head towards my sides; letting him know, as well as I could, how\\ncruelly I was hurt by the pressure of his thumb and finger.  He seemed to\\napprehend my meaning; for, lifting up the lappet of his coat, he put me\\ngently into it, and immediately ran along with me to his master, who was\\na substantial farmer, and the same person I had first seen in the field.\\n\\nThe farmer having (as I suppose by their talk) received such an account\\nof me as his servant could give him, took a piece of a small straw, about\\nthe size of a walking-staff, and therewith lifted up the lappets of my\\ncoat; which it seems he thought to be some kind of covering that nature\\nhad given me.  He blew my hairs aside to take a better view of my face.\\nHe called his hinds about him, and asked them, as I afterwards learned,\\nwhether they had ever seen in the fields any little creature that\\nresembled me.  He then placed me softly on the ground upon all fours, but\\nI got immediately up, and walked slowly backward and forward, to let\\nthose people see I had no intent to run away.  They all sat down in a\\ncircle about me, the better to observe my motions.  I pulled off my hat,\\nand made a low bow towards the farmer.  I fell on my knees, and lifted up\\nmy hands and eyes, and spoke several words as loud as I could: I took a\\npurse of gold out of my pocket, and humbly presented it to him.  He\\nreceived it on the palm of his hand, then applied it close to his eye to\\nsee what it was, and afterwards turned it several times with the point of\\na pin (which he took out of his sleeve,) but could make nothing of it.\\nWhereupon I made a sign that he should place his hand on the ground.  I\\nthen took the purse, and, opening it, poured all the gold into his palm.\\nThere were six Spanish pieces of four pistoles each, beside twenty or\\nthirty smaller coins.  I saw him wet the tip of his little finger upon\\nhis tongue, and take up one of my largest pieces, and then another; but\\nhe seemed to be wholly ignorant what they were.  He made me a sign to put\\nthem again into my purse, and the purse again into my pocket, which,\\nafter offering it to him several times, I thought it best to do.\\n\\nThe farmer, by this time, was convinced I must be a rational creature.\\nHe spoke often to me; but the sound of his voice pierced my ears like\\nthat of a water-mill, yet his words were articulate enough.  I answered\\nas loud as I could in several languages, and he often laid his ear within\\ntwo yards of me: but all in vain, for we were wholly unintelligible to\\neach other.  He then sent his servants to their work, and taking his\\nhandkerchief out of his pocket, he doubled and spread it on his left\\nhand, which he placed flat on the ground with the palm upward, making me\\na sign to step into it, as I could easily do, for it was not above a foot\\nin thickness.  I thought it my part to obey, and, for fear of falling,\\nlaid myself at full length upon the handkerchief, with the remainder of\\nwhich he lapped me up to the head for further security, and in this\\nmanner carried me home to his house.  There he called his wife, and\\nshowed me to her; but she screamed and ran back, as women in England do\\nat the sight of a toad or a spider.  However, when she had a while seen\\nmy behaviour, and how well I observed the signs her husband made, she was\\nsoon reconciled, and by degrees grew extremely tender of me.\\n\\nIt was about twelve at noon, and a servant brought in dinner.  It was\\nonly one substantial dish of meat (fit for the plain condition of a\\nhusbandman,) in a dish of about four-and-twenty feet diameter.  The\\ncompany were, the farmer and his wife, three children, and an old\\ngrandmother.  When they were sat down, the farmer placed me at some\\ndistance from him on the table, which was thirty feet high from the\\nfloor.  I was in a terrible fright, and kept as far as I could from the\\nedge, for fear of falling.  The wife minced a bit of meat, then crumbled\\nsome bread on a trencher, and placed it before me.  I made her a low bow,\\ntook out my knife and fork, and fell to eat, which gave them exceeding\\ndelight.  The mistress sent her maid for a small dram cup, which held\\nabout two gallons, and filled it with drink; I took up the vessel with\\nmuch difficulty in both hands, and in a most respectful manner drank to\\nher ladyship’s health, expressing the words as loud as I could in\\nEnglish, which made the company laugh so heartily, that I was almost\\ndeafened with the noise.  This liquor tasted like a small cider, and was\\nnot unpleasant.  Then the master made me a sign to come to his trencher\\nside; but as I walked on the table, being in great surprise all the time,\\nas the indulgent reader will easily conceive and excuse, I happened to\\nstumble against a crust, and fell flat on my face, but received no hurt.\\nI got up immediately, and observing the good people to be in much\\nconcern, I took my hat (which I held under my arm out of good manners,)\\nand waving it over my head, made three huzzas, to show I had got no\\nmischief by my fall.  But advancing forward towards my master (as I shall\\nhenceforth call him,) his youngest son, who sat next to him, an arch boy\\nof about ten years old, took me up by the legs, and held me so high in\\nthe air, that I trembled every limb: but his father snatched me from him,\\nand at the same time gave him such a box on the left ear, as would have\\nfelled an European troop of horse to the earth, ordering him to be taken\\nfrom the table.  But being afraid the boy might owe me a spite, and well\\nremembering how mischievous all children among us naturally are to\\nsparrows, rabbits, young kittens, and puppy dogs, I fell on my knees, and\\npointing to the boy, made my master to understand, as well as I could,\\nthat I desired his son might be pardoned.  The father complied, and the\\nlad took his seat again, whereupon I went to him, and kissed his hand,\\nwhich my master took, and made him stroke me gently with it.\\n\\nIn the midst of dinner, my mistress’s favourite cat leaped into her lap.\\nI heard a noise behind me like that of a dozen stocking-weavers at work;\\nand turning my head, I found it proceeded from the purring of that\\nanimal, who seemed to be three times larger than an ox, as I computed by\\nthe view of her head, and one of her paws, while her mistress was feeding\\nand stroking her.  The fierceness of this creature’s countenance\\naltogether discomposed me; though I stood at the farther end of the\\ntable, above fifty feet off; and although my mistress held her fast, for\\nfear she might give a spring, and seize me in her talons.  But it\\nhappened there was no danger, for the cat took not the least notice of me\\nwhen my master placed me within three yards of her.  And as I have been\\nalways told, and found true by experience in my travels, that flying or\\ndiscovering fear before a fierce animal, is a certain way to make it\\npursue or attack you, so I resolved, in this dangerous juncture, to show\\nno manner of concern.  I walked with intrepidity five or six times before\\nthe very head of the cat, and came within half a yard of her; whereupon\\nshe drew herself back, as if she were more afraid of me: I had less\\napprehension concerning the dogs, whereof three or four came into the\\nroom, as it is usual in farmers’ houses; one of which was a mastiff,\\nequal in bulk to four elephants, and another a greyhound, somewhat taller\\nthan the mastiff, but not so large.\\n\\nWhen dinner was almost done, the nurse came in with a child of a year old\\nin her arms, who immediately spied me, and began a squall that you might\\nhave heard from London-Bridge to Chelsea, after the usual oratory of\\ninfants, to get me for a plaything.  The mother, out of pure indulgence,\\ntook me up, and put me towards the child, who presently seized me by the\\nmiddle, and got my head into his mouth, where I roared so loud that the\\nurchin was frighted, and let me drop, and I should infallibly have broke\\nmy neck, if the mother had not held her apron under me.  The nurse, to\\nquiet her babe, made use of a rattle which was a kind of hollow vessel\\nfilled with great stones, and fastened by a cable to the child’s waist:\\nbut all in vain; so that she was forced to apply the last remedy by\\ngiving it suck.  I must confess no object ever disgusted me so much as\\nthe sight of her monstrous breast, which I cannot tell what to compare\\nwith, so as to give the curious reader an idea of its bulk, shape, and\\ncolour.  It stood prominent six feet, and could not be less than sixteen\\nin circumference.  The nipple was about half the bigness of my head, and\\nthe hue both of that and the dug, so varied with spots, pimples, and\\nfreckles, that nothing could appear more nauseous: for I had a near sight\\nof her, she sitting down, the more conveniently to give suck, and I\\nstanding on the table.  This made me reflect upon the fair skins of our\\nEnglish ladies, who appear so beautiful to us, only because they are of\\nour own size, and their defects not to be seen but through a magnifying\\nglass; where we find by experiment that the smoothest and whitest skins\\nlook rough, and coarse, and ill-coloured.\\n\\nI remember when I was at Lilliput, the complexion of those diminutive\\npeople appeared to me the fairest in the world; and talking upon this\\nsubject with a person of learning there, who was an intimate friend of\\nmine, he said that my face appeared much fairer and smoother when he\\nlooked on me from the ground, than it did upon a nearer view, when I took\\nhim up in my hand, and brought him close, which he confessed was at first\\na very shocking sight.  He said, “he could discover great holes in my\\nskin; that the stumps of my beard were ten times stronger than the\\nbristles of a boar, and my complexion made up of several colours\\naltogether disagreeable:” although I must beg leave to say for myself,\\nthat I am as fair as most of my sex and country, and very little sunburnt\\nby all my travels.  On the other side, discoursing of the ladies in that\\nemperor’s court, he used to tell me, “one had freckles; another too wide\\na mouth; a third too large a nose;” nothing of which I was able to\\ndistinguish.  I confess this reflection was obvious enough; which,\\nhowever, I could not forbear, lest the reader might think those vast\\ncreatures were actually deformed: for I must do them the justice to say,\\nthey are a comely race of people, and particularly the features of my\\nmaster’s countenance, although he was but a farmer, when I beheld him\\nfrom the height of sixty feet, appeared very well proportioned.\\n\\nWhen dinner was done, my master went out to his labourers, and, as I\\ncould discover by his voice and gesture, gave his wife strict charge to\\ntake care of me.  I was very much tired, and disposed to sleep, which my\\nmistress perceiving, she put me on her own bed, and covered me with a\\nclean white handkerchief, but larger and coarser than the mainsail of a\\nman-of-war.\\n\\nI slept about two hours, and dreamt I was at home with my wife and\\nchildren, which aggravated my sorrows when I awaked, and found myself\\nalone in a vast room, between two and three hundred feet wide, and above\\ntwo hundred high, lying in a bed twenty yards wide.  My mistress was gone\\nabout her household affairs, and had locked me in.  The bed was eight\\nyards from the floor.  Some natural necessities required me to get down;\\nI durst not presume to call; and if I had, it would have been in vain,\\nwith such a voice as mine, at so great a distance from the room where I\\nlay to the kitchen where the family kept.  While I was under these\\ncircumstances, two rats crept up the curtains, and ran smelling backwards\\nand forwards on the bed.  One of them came up almost to my face,\\nwhereupon I rose in a fright, and drew out my hanger to defend myself.\\nThese horrible animals had the boldness to attack me on both sides, and\\none of them held his fore-feet at my collar; but I had the good fortune\\nto rip up his belly before he could do me any mischief.  He fell down at\\nmy feet; and the other, seeing the fate of his comrade, made his escape,\\nbut not without one good wound on the back, which I gave him as he fled,\\nand made the blood run trickling from him.  After this exploit, I walked\\ngently to and fro on the bed, to recover my breath and loss of spirits.\\nThese creatures were of the size of a large mastiff, but infinitely more\\nnimble and fierce; so that if I had taken off my belt before I went to\\nsleep, I must have infallibly been torn to pieces and devoured.  I\\nmeasured the tail of the dead rat, and found it to be two yards long,\\nwanting an inch; but it went against my stomach to drag the carcass off\\nthe bed, where it lay still bleeding; I observed it had yet some life,\\nbut with a strong slash across the neck, I thoroughly despatched it.\\n\\nSoon after my mistress came into the room, who seeing me all bloody, ran\\nand took me up in her hand.  I pointed to the dead rat, smiling, and\\nmaking other signs to show I was not hurt; whereat she was extremely\\nrejoiced, calling the maid to take up the dead rat with a pair of tongs,\\nand throw it out of the window.  Then she set me on a table, where I\\nshowed her my hanger all bloody, and wiping it on the lappet of my coat,\\nreturned it to the scabbard.  I was pressed to do more than one thing\\nwhich another could not do for me, and therefore endeavoured to make my\\nmistress understand, that I desired to be set down on the floor; which\\nafter she had done, my bashfulness would not suffer me to express myself\\nfarther, than by pointing to the door, and bowing several times.  The\\ngood woman, with much difficulty, at last perceived what I would be at,\\nand taking me up again in her hand, walked into the garden, where she set\\nme down.  I went on one side about two hundred yards, and beckoning to\\nher not to look or to follow me, I hid myself between two leaves of\\nsorrel, and there discharged the necessities of nature.\\n\\nI hope the gentle reader will excuse me for dwelling on these and the\\nlike particulars, which, however insignificant they may appear to\\ngroveling vulgar minds, yet will certainly help a philosopher to enlarge\\nhis thoughts and imagination, and apply them to the benefit of public as\\nwell as private life, which was my sole design in presenting this and\\nother accounts of my travels to the world; wherein I have been chiefly\\nstudious of truth, without affecting any ornaments of learning or of\\nstyle.  But the whole scene of this voyage made so strong an impression\\non my mind, and is so deeply fixed in my memory, that, in committing it\\nto paper I did not omit one material circumstance: however, upon a strict\\nreview, I blotted out several passages.  Of less moment which were in my\\nfirst copy, for fear of being censured as tedious and trifling, whereof\\ntravellers are often, perhaps not without justice, accused.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\n\\nA description of the farmer’s daughter.  The author carried to a\\nmarket-town, and then to the metropolis.  The particulars of his journey.\\n\\nMy mistress had a daughter of nine years old, a child of towardly parts\\nfor her age, very dexterous at her needle, and skilful in dressing her\\nbaby.  Her mother and she contrived to fit up the baby’s cradle for me\\nagainst night: the cradle was put into a small drawer of a cabinet, and\\nthe drawer placed upon a hanging shelf for fear of the rats.  This was my\\nbed all the time I staid with those people, though made more convenient\\nby degrees, as I began to learn their language and make my wants known.\\nThis young girl was so handy, that after I had once or twice pulled off\\nmy clothes before her, she was able to dress and undress me, though I\\nnever gave her that trouble when she would let me do either myself.  She\\nmade me seven shirts, and some other linen, of as fine cloth as could be\\ngot, which indeed was coarser than sackcloth; and these she constantly\\nwashed for me with her own hands.  She was likewise my school-mistress,\\nto teach me the language: when I pointed to any thing, she told me the\\nname of it in her own tongue, so that in a few days I was able to call\\nfor whatever I had a mind to.  She was very good-natured, and not above\\nforty feet high, being little for her age.  She gave me the name of\\n_Grildrig_, which the family took up, and afterwards the whole kingdom.\\nThe word imports what the Latins call _nanunculus_, the Italians\\n_homunceletino_, and the English _mannikin_.  To her I chiefly owe my\\npreservation in that country: we never parted while I was there; I called\\nher my _Glumdalclitch_, or little nurse; and should be guilty of great\\ningratitude, if I omitted this honourable mention of her care and\\naffection towards me, which I heartily wish it lay in my power to requite\\nas she deserves, instead of being the innocent, but unhappy instrument of\\nher disgrace, as I have too much reason to fear.\\n\\nIt now began to be known and talked of in the neighbourhood, that my\\nmaster had found a strange animal in the field, about the bigness of a\\n_splacnuck_, but exactly shaped in every part like a human creature;\\nwhich it likewise imitated in all its actions; seemed to speak in a\\nlittle language of its own, had already learned several words of theirs,\\nwent erect upon two legs, was tame and gentle, would come when it was\\ncalled, do whatever it was bid, had the finest limbs in the world, and a\\ncomplexion fairer than a nobleman’s daughter of three years old.  Another\\nfarmer, who lived hard by, and was a particular friend of my master, came\\non a visit on purpose to inquire into the truth of this story.  I was\\nimmediately produced, and placed upon a table, where I walked as I was\\ncommanded, drew my hanger, put it up again, made my reverence to my\\nmaster’s guest, asked him in his own language how he did, and told him\\n_he was welcome_, just as my little nurse had instructed me.  This man,\\nwho was old and dim-sighted, put on his spectacles to behold me better;\\nat which I could not forbear laughing very heartily, for his eyes\\nappeared like the full moon shining into a chamber at two windows.  Our\\npeople, who discovered the cause of my mirth, bore me company in\\nlaughing, at which the old fellow was fool enough to be angry and out of\\ncountenance.  He had the character of a great miser; and, to my\\nmisfortune, he well deserved it, by the cursed advice he gave my master,\\nto show me as a sight upon a market-day in the next town, which was half\\nan hour’s riding, about two-and-twenty miles from our house.  I guessed\\nthere was some mischief when I observed my master and his friend\\nwhispering together, sometimes pointing at me; and my fears made me fancy\\nthat I overheard and understood some of their words.  But the next\\nmorning Glumdalclitch, my little nurse, told me the whole matter, which\\nshe had cunningly picked out from her mother.  The poor girl laid me on\\nher bosom, and fell a weeping with shame and grief.  She apprehended some\\nmischief would happen to me from rude vulgar folks, who might squeeze me\\nto death, or break one of my limbs by taking me in their hands.  She had\\nalso observed how modest I was in my nature, how nicely I regarded my\\nhonour, and what an indignity I should conceive it, to be exposed for\\nmoney as a public spectacle, to the meanest of the people.  She said, her\\npapa and mamma had promised that Grildrig should be hers; but now she\\nfound they meant to serve her as they did last year, when they pretended\\nto give her a lamb, and yet, as soon as it was fat, sold it to a butcher.\\nFor my own part, I may truly affirm, that I was less concerned than my\\nnurse.  I had a strong hope, which never left me, that I should one day\\nrecover my liberty: and as to the ignominy of being carried about for a\\nmonster, I considered myself to be a perfect stranger in the country, and\\nthat such a misfortune could never be charged upon me as a reproach, if\\never I should return to England, since the king of Great Britain himself,\\nin my condition, must have undergone the same distress.\\n\\nMy master, pursuant to the advice of his friend, carried me in a box the\\nnext market-day to the neighbouring town, and took along with him his\\nlittle daughter, my nurse, upon a pillion behind him.  The box was close\\non every side, with a little door for me to go in and out, and a few\\ngimlet holes to let in air.  The girl had been so careful as to put the\\nquilt of her baby’s bed into it, for me to lie down on.  However, I was\\nterribly shaken and discomposed in this journey, though it was but of\\nhalf an hour: for the horse went about forty feet at every step and\\ntrotted so high, that the agitation was equal to the rising and falling\\nof a ship in a great storm, but much more frequent.  Our journey was\\nsomewhat farther than from London to St. Alban’s.  My master alighted at\\nan inn which he used to frequent; and after consulting awhile with the\\ninn-keeper, and making some necessary preparations, he hired the\\n_grultrud_, or crier, to give notice through the town of a strange\\ncreature to be seen at the sign of the Green Eagle, not so big as a\\n_splacnuck_ (an animal in that country very finely shaped, about six feet\\nlong,) and in every part of the body resembling a human creature, could\\nspeak several words, and perform a hundred diverting tricks.\\n\\nI was placed upon a table in the largest room of the inn, which might be\\nnear three hundred feet square.  My little nurse stood on a low stool\\nclose to the table, to take care of me, and direct what I should do.  My\\nmaster, to avoid a crowd, would suffer only thirty people at a time to\\nsee me.  I walked about on the table as the girl commanded; she asked me\\nquestions, as far as she knew my understanding of the language reached,\\nand I answered them as loud as I could.  I turned about several times to\\nthe company, paid my humble respects, said _they were welcome_, and used\\nsome other speeches I had been taught.  I took up a thimble filled with\\nliquor, which Glumdalclitch had given me for a cup, and drank their\\nhealth, I drew out my hanger, and flourished with it after the manner of\\nfencers in England.  My nurse gave me a part of a straw, which I\\nexercised as a pike, having learnt the art in my youth.  I was that day\\nshown to twelve sets of company, and as often forced to act over again\\nthe same fopperies, till I was half dead with weariness and vexation; for\\nthose who had seen me made such wonderful reports, that the people were\\nready to break down the doors to come in.  My master, for his own\\ninterest, would not suffer any one to touch me except my nurse; and to\\nprevent danger, benches were set round the table at such a distance as to\\nput me out of every body’s reach.  However, an unlucky school-boy aimed a\\nhazel nut directly at my head, which very narrowly missed me; otherwise\\nit came with so much violence, that it would have infallibly knocked out\\nmy brains, for it was almost as large as a small pumpkin, but I had the\\nsatisfaction to see the young rogue well beaten, and turned out of the\\nroom.\\n\\nMy master gave public notice that he would show me again the next\\nmarket-day; and in the meantime he prepared a convenient vehicle for me,\\nwhich he had reason enough to do; for I was so tired with my first\\njourney, and with entertaining company for eight hours together, that I\\ncould hardly stand upon my legs, or speak a word.  It was at least three\\ndays before I recovered my strength; and that I might have no rest at\\nhome, all the neighbouring gentlemen from a hundred miles round, hearing\\nof my fame, came to see me at my master’s own house.  There could not be\\nfewer than thirty persons with their wives and children (for the country\\nis very populous;) and my master demanded the rate of a full room\\nwhenever he showed me at home, although it were only to a single family;\\nso that for some time I had but little ease every day of the week (except\\nWednesday, which is their Sabbath,) although I were not carried to the\\ntown.\\n\\nMy master, finding how profitable I was likely to be, resolved to carry\\nme to the most considerable cities of the kingdom.  Having therefore\\nprovided himself with all things necessary for a long journey, and\\nsettled his affairs at home, he took leave of his wife, and upon the 17th\\nof August, 1703, about two months after my arrival, we set out for the\\nmetropolis, situate near the middle of that empire, and about three\\nthousand miles distance from our house.  My master made his daughter\\nGlumdalclitch ride behind him.  She carried me on her lap, in a box tied\\nabout her waist.  The girl had lined it on all sides with the softest\\ncloth she could get, well quilted underneath, furnished it with her\\nbaby’s bed, provided me with linen and other necessaries, and made\\neverything as convenient as she could.  We had no other company but a boy\\nof the house, who rode after us with the luggage.\\n\\nMy master’s design was to show me in all the towns by the way, and to\\nstep out of the road for fifty or a hundred miles, to any village, or\\nperson of quality’s house, where he might expect custom.  We made easy\\njourneys, of not above seven or eight score miles a-day; for\\nGlumdalclitch, on purpose to spare me, complained she was tired with the\\ntrotting of the horse.  She often took me out of my box, at my own\\ndesire, to give me air, and show me the country, but always held me fast\\nby a leading-string.  We passed over five or six rivers, many degrees\\nbroader and deeper than the Nile or the Ganges: and there was hardly a\\nrivulet so small as the Thames at London-bridge.  We were ten weeks in\\nour journey, and I was shown in eighteen large towns, besides many\\nvillages, and private families.\\n\\nOn the 26th day of October we arrived at the metropolis, called in their\\nlanguage _Lorbrulgrud_, or Pride of the Universe.  My master took a\\nlodging in the principal street of the city, not far from the royal\\npalace, and put out bills in the usual form, containing an exact\\ndescription of my person and parts.  He hired a large room between three\\nand four hundred feet wide.  He provided a table sixty feet in diameter,\\nupon which I was to act my part, and pallisadoed it round three feet from\\nthe edge, and as many high, to prevent my falling over.  I was shown ten\\ntimes a-day, to the wonder and satisfaction of all people.  I could now\\nspeak the language tolerably well, and perfectly understood every word,\\nthat was spoken to me.  Besides, I had learnt their alphabet, and could\\nmake a shift to explain a sentence here and there; for Glumdalclitch had\\nbeen my instructor while we were at home, and at leisure hours during our\\njourney.  She carried a little book in her pocket, not much larger than a\\nSanson’s Atlas; it was a common treatise for the use of young girls,\\ngiving a short account of their religion: out of this she taught me my\\nletters, and interpreted the words.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\n\\nThe author sent for to court.  The queen buys him of his master the\\nfarmer, and presents him to the king.  He disputes with his majesty’s\\ngreat scholars.  An apartment at court provided for the author.  He is in\\nhigh favour with the queen.  He stands up for the honour of his own\\ncountry.  His quarrels with the queen’s dwarf.\\n\\nThe frequent labours I underwent every day, made, in a few weeks, a very\\nconsiderable change in my health: the more my master got by me, the more\\ninsatiable he grew.  I had quite lost my stomach, and was almost reduced\\nto a skeleton.  The farmer observed it, and concluding I must soon die,\\nresolved to make as good a hand of me as he could.  While he was thus\\nreasoning and resolving with himself, a _sardral_, or gentleman-usher,\\ncame from court, commanding my master to carry me immediately thither for\\nthe diversion of the queen and her ladies.  Some of the latter had\\nalready been to see me, and reported strange things of my beauty,\\nbehaviour, and good sense.  Her majesty, and those who attended her, were\\nbeyond measure delighted with my demeanour.  I fell on my knees, and\\nbegged the honour of kissing her imperial foot; but this gracious\\nprincess held out her little finger towards me, after I was set on the\\ntable, which I embraced in both my arms, and put the tip of it with the\\nutmost respect to my lip.  She made me some general questions about my\\ncountry and my travels, which I answered as distinctly, and in as few\\nwords as I could.  She asked, “whether I could be content to live at\\ncourt?”  I bowed down to the board of the table, and humbly answered\\n“that I was my master’s slave: but, if I were at my own disposal, I\\nshould be proud to devote my life to her majesty’s service.”  She then\\nasked my master, “whether he was willing to sell me at a good price?”\\nHe, who apprehended I could not live a month, was ready enough to part\\nwith me, and demanded a thousand pieces of gold, which were ordered him\\non the spot, each piece being about the bigness of eight hundred\\nmoidores; but allowing for the proportion of all things between that\\ncountry and Europe, and the high price of gold among them, was hardly so\\ngreat a sum as a thousand guineas would be in England.  I then said to\\nthe queen, “since I was now her majesty’s most humble creature and\\nvassal, I must beg the favour, that Glumdalclitch, who had always tended\\nme with so much care and kindness, and understood to do it so well, might\\nbe admitted into her service, and continue to be my nurse and\\ninstructor.”\\n\\nHer majesty agreed to my petition, and easily got the farmer’s consent,\\nwho was glad enough to have his daughter preferred at court, and the poor\\ngirl herself was not able to hide her joy.  My late master withdrew,\\nbidding me farewell, and saying he had left me in a good service; to\\nwhich I replied not a word, only making him a slight bow.\\n\\nThe queen observed my coldness; and, when the farmer was gone out of the\\napartment, asked me the reason.  I made bold to tell her majesty, “that I\\nowed no other obligation to my late master, than his not dashing out the\\nbrains of a poor harmless creature, found by chance in his fields: which\\nobligation was amply recompensed, by the gain he had made in showing me\\nthrough half the kingdom, and the price he had now sold me for.  That the\\nlife I had since led was laborious enough to kill an animal of ten times\\nmy strength.  That my health was much impaired, by the continual drudgery\\nof entertaining the rabble every hour of the day; and that, if my master\\nhad not thought my life in danger, her majesty would not have got so\\ncheap a bargain.  But as I was out of all fear of being ill-treated under\\nthe protection of so great and good an empress, the ornament of nature,\\nthe darling of the world, the delight of her subjects, the phoenix of the\\ncreation, so I hoped my late master’s apprehensions would appear to be\\ngroundless; for I already found my spirits revive, by the influence of\\nher most august presence.”\\n\\nThis was the sum of my speech, delivered with great improprieties and\\nhesitation.  The latter part was altogether framed in the style peculiar\\nto that people, whereof I learned some phrases from Glumdalclitch, while\\nshe was carrying me to court.\\n\\nThe queen, giving great allowance for my defectiveness in speaking, was,\\nhowever, surprised at so much wit and good sense in so diminutive an\\nanimal.  She took me in her own hand, and carried me to the king, who was\\nthen retired to his cabinet.  His majesty, a prince of much gravity and\\naustere countenance, not well observing my shape at first view, asked the\\nqueen after a cold manner “how long it was since she grew fond of a\\n_splacnuck_?” for such it seems he took me to be, as I lay upon my breast\\nin her majesty’s right hand.  But this princess, who has an infinite deal\\nof wit and humour, set me gently on my feet upon the scrutoire, and\\ncommanded me to give his majesty an account of myself, which I did in a\\nvery few words: and Glumdalclitch who attended at the cabinet door, and\\ncould not endure I should be out of her sight, being admitted, confirmed\\nall that had passed from my arrival at her father’s house.\\n\\nThe king, although he be as learned a person as any in his dominions, had\\nbeen educated in the study of philosophy, and particularly mathematics;\\nyet when he observed my shape exactly, and saw me walk erect, before I\\nbegan to speak, conceived I might be a piece of clock-work (which is in\\nthat country arrived to a very great perfection) contrived by some\\ningenious artist.  But when he heard my voice, and found what I delivered\\nto be regular and rational, he could not conceal his astonishment.  He\\nwas by no means satisfied with the relation I gave him of the manner I\\ncame into his kingdom, but thought it a story concerted between\\nGlumdalclitch and her father, who had taught me a set of words to make me\\nsell at a better price.  Upon this imagination, he put several other\\nquestions to me, and still received rational answers: no otherwise\\ndefective than by a foreign accent, and an imperfect knowledge in the\\nlanguage, with some rustic phrases which I had learned at the farmer’s\\nhouse, and did not suit the polite style of a court.\\n\\nHis majesty sent for three great scholars, who were then in their weekly\\nwaiting, according to the custom in that country.  These gentlemen, after\\nthey had a while examined my shape with much nicety, were of different\\nopinions concerning me.  They all agreed that I could not be produced\\naccording to the regular laws of nature, because I was not framed with a\\ncapacity of preserving my life, either by swiftness, or climbing of\\ntrees, or digging holes in the earth.  They observed by my teeth, which\\nthey viewed with great exactness, that I was a carnivorous animal; yet\\nmost quadrupeds being an overmatch for me, and field mice, with some\\nothers, too nimble, they could not imagine how I should be able to\\nsupport myself, unless I fed upon snails and other insects, which they\\noffered, by many learned arguments, to evince that I could not possibly\\ndo.  One of these virtuosi seemed to think that I might be an embryo, or\\nabortive birth.  But this opinion was rejected by the other two, who\\nobserved my limbs to be perfect and finished; and that I had lived\\nseveral years, as it was manifest from my beard, the stumps whereof they\\nplainly discovered through a magnifying glass.  They would not allow me\\nto be a dwarf, because my littleness was beyond all degrees of\\ncomparison; for the queen’s favourite dwarf, the smallest ever known in\\nthat kingdom, was near thirty feet high.  After much debate, they\\nconcluded unanimously, that I was only _relplum scalcath_, which is\\ninterpreted literally _lusus naturæ_; a determination exactly agreeable\\nto the modern philosophy of Europe, whose professors, disdaining the old\\nevasion of occult causes, whereby the followers of Aristotle endeavoured\\nin vain to disguise their ignorance, have invented this wonderful\\nsolution of all difficulties, to the unspeakable advancement of human\\nknowledge.\\n\\nAfter this decisive conclusion, I entreated to be heard a word or two.  I\\napplied myself to the king, and assured his majesty, “that I came from a\\ncountry which abounded with several millions of both sexes, and of my own\\nstature; where the animals, trees, and houses, were all in proportion,\\nand where, by consequence, I might be as able to defend myself, and to\\nfind sustenance, as any of his majesty’s subjects could do here; which I\\ntook for a full answer to those gentlemen’s arguments.”  To this they\\nonly replied with a smile of contempt, saying, “that the farmer had\\ninstructed me very well in my lesson.”  The king, who had a much better\\nunderstanding, dismissing his learned men, sent for the farmer, who by\\ngood fortune was not yet gone out of town.  Having therefore first\\nexamined him privately, and then confronted him with me and the young\\ngirl, his majesty began to think that what we told him might possibly be\\ntrue. He desired the queen to order that a particular care should be\\ntaken of me; and was of opinion that Glumdalclitch should still continue\\nin her office of tending me, because he observed we had a great affection\\nfor each other.  A convenient apartment was provided for her at court:\\nshe had a sort of governess appointed to take care of her education, a\\nmaid to dress her, and two other servants for menial offices; but the\\ncare of me was wholly appropriated to herself.  The queen commanded her\\nown cabinet-maker to contrive a box, that might serve me for a\\nbedchamber, after the model that Glumdalclitch and I should agree upon.\\nThis man was a most ingenious artist, and according to my direction, in\\nthree weeks finished for me a wooden chamber of sixteen feet square, and\\ntwelve high, with sash-windows, a door, and two closets, like a London\\nbed-chamber.  The board, that made the ceiling, was to be lifted up and\\ndown by two hinges, to put in a bed ready furnished by her majesty’s\\nupholsterer, which Glumdalclitch took out every day to air, made it with\\nher own hands, and letting it down at night, locked up the roof over me.\\nA nice workman, who was famous for little curiosities, undertook to make\\nme two chairs, with backs and frames, of a substance not unlike ivory,\\nand two tables, with a cabinet to put my things in.  The room was quilted\\non all sides, as well as the floor and the ceiling, to prevent any\\naccident from the carelessness of those who carried me, and to break the\\nforce of a jolt, when I went in a coach.  I desired a lock for my door,\\nto prevent rats and mice from coming in.  The smith, after several\\nattempts, made the smallest that ever was seen among them, for I have\\nknown a larger at the gate of a gentleman’s house in England.  I made a\\nshift to keep the key in a pocket of my own, fearing Glumdalclitch might\\nlose it.  The queen likewise ordered the thinnest silks that could be\\ngotten, to make me clothes, not much thicker than an English blanket,\\nvery cumbersome till I was accustomed to them.  They were after the\\nfashion of the kingdom, partly resembling the Persian, and partly the\\nChinese, and are a very grave and decent habit.\\n\\nThe queen became so fond of my company, that she could not dine without\\nme.  I had a table placed upon the same at which her majesty ate, just at\\nher left elbow, and a chair to sit on.  Glumdalclitch stood on a stool on\\nthe floor near my table, to assist and take care of me.  I had an entire\\nset of silver dishes and plates, and other necessaries, which, in\\nproportion to those of the queen, were not much bigger than what I have\\nseen in a London toy-shop for the furniture of a baby-house: these my\\nlittle nurse kept in her pocket in a silver box, and gave me at meals as\\nI wanted them, always cleaning them herself.  No person dined with the\\nqueen but the two princesses royal, the eldest sixteen years old, and the\\nyounger at that time thirteen and a month.  Her majesty used to put a bit\\nof meat upon one of my dishes, out of which I carved for myself, and her\\ndiversion was to see me eat in miniature: for the queen (who had indeed\\nbut a weak stomach) took up, at one mouthful, as much as a dozen English\\nfarmers could eat at a meal, which to me was for some time a very\\nnauseous sight.  She would craunch the wing of a lark, bones and all,\\nbetween her teeth, although it were nine times as large as that of a\\nfull-grown turkey; and put a bit of bread into her mouth as big as two\\ntwelve-penny loaves.  She drank out of a golden cup, above a hogshead at\\na draught.  Her knives were twice as long as a scythe, set straight upon\\nthe handle.  The spoons, forks, and other instruments, were all in the\\nsame proportion.  I remember when Glumdalclitch carried me, out of\\ncuriosity, to see some of the tables at court, where ten or a dozen of\\nthose enormous knives and forks were lifted up together, I thought I had\\nnever till then beheld so terrible a sight.\\n\\nIt is the custom, that every Wednesday (which, as I have observed, is\\ntheir Sabbath) the king and queen, with the royal issue of both sexes,\\ndine together in the apartment of his majesty, to whom I was now become a\\ngreat favourite; and at these times, my little chair and table were\\nplaced at his left hand, before one of the salt-cellars.  This prince\\ntook a pleasure in conversing with me, inquiring into the manners,\\nreligion, laws, government, and learning of Europe; wherein I gave him\\nthe best account I was able.  His apprehension was so clear, and his\\njudgment so exact, that he made very wise reflections and observations\\nupon all I said.  But I confess, that, after I had been a little too\\ncopious in talking of my own beloved country, of our trade and wars by\\nsea and land, of our schisms in religion, and parties in the state; the\\nprejudices of his education prevailed so far, that he could not forbear\\ntaking me up in his right hand, and stroking me gently with the other,\\nafter a hearty fit of laughing, asked me, “whether I was a whig or tory?”\\nThen turning to his first minister, who waited behind him with a white\\nstaff, near as tall as the mainmast of the Royal Sovereign, he observed\\n“how contemptible a thing was human grandeur, which could be mimicked by\\nsuch diminutive insects as I: and yet,” says he, “I dare engage these\\ncreatures have their titles and distinctions of honour; they contrive\\nlittle nests and burrows, that they call houses and cities; they make a\\nfigure in dress and equipage; they love, they fight, they dispute, they\\ncheat, they betray!”  And thus he continued on, while my colour came and\\nwent several times, with indignation, to hear our noble country, the\\nmistress of arts and arms, the scourge of France, the arbitress of\\nEurope, the seat of virtue, piety, honour, and truth, the pride and envy\\nof the world, so contemptuously treated.\\n\\nBut as I was not in a condition to resent injuries, so upon mature\\nthoughts I began to doubt whether I was injured or no.  For, after having\\nbeen accustomed several months to the sight and converse of this people,\\nand observed every object upon which I cast mine eyes to be of\\nproportionable magnitude, the horror I had at first conceived from their\\nbulk and aspect was so far worn off, that if I had then beheld a company\\nof English lords and ladies in their finery and birth-day clothes, acting\\ntheir several parts in the most courtly manner of strutting, and bowing,\\nand prating, to say the truth, I should have been strongly tempted to\\nlaugh as much at them as the king and his grandees did at me.  Neither,\\nindeed, could I forbear smiling at myself, when the queen used to place\\nme upon her hand towards a looking-glass, by which both our persons\\nappeared before me in full view together; and there could be nothing more\\nridiculous than the comparison; so that I really began to imagine myself\\ndwindled many degrees below my usual size.\\n\\nNothing angered and mortified me so much as the queen’s dwarf; who being\\nof the lowest stature that was ever in that country (for I verily think\\nhe was not full thirty feet high), became so insolent at seeing a\\ncreature so much beneath him, that he would always affect to swagger and\\nlook big as he passed by me in the queen’s antechamber, while I was\\nstanding on some table talking with the lords or ladies of the court, and\\nhe seldom failed of a smart word or two upon my littleness; against which\\nI could only revenge myself by calling him brother, challenging him to\\nwrestle, and such repartees as are usually in the mouths of court pages.\\nOne day, at dinner, this malicious little cub was so nettled with\\nsomething I had said to him, that, raising himself upon the frame of her\\nmajesty’s chair, he took me up by the middle, as I was sitting down, not\\nthinking any harm, and let me drop into a large silver bowl of cream, and\\nthen ran away as fast as he could.  I fell over head and ears, and, if I\\nhad not been a good swimmer, it might have gone very hard with me; for\\nGlumdalclitch in that instant happened to be at the other end of the\\nroom, and the queen was in such a fright, that she wanted presence of\\nmind to assist me.  But my little nurse ran to my relief, and took me\\nout, after I had swallowed above a quart of cream.  I was put to bed:\\nhowever, I received no other damage than the loss of a suit of clothes,\\nwhich was utterly spoiled.  The dwarf was soundly whipt, and as a farther\\npunishment, forced to drink up the bowl of cream into which he had thrown\\nme: neither was he ever restored to favour; for soon after the queen\\nbestowed him on a lady of high quality, so that I saw him no more, to my\\nvery great satisfaction; for I could not tell to what extremities such a\\nmalicious urchin might have carried his resentment.\\n\\nHe had before served me a scurvy trick, which set the queen a-laughing,\\nalthough at the same time she was heartily vexed, and would have\\nimmediately cashiered him, if I had not been so generous as to intercede.\\nHer majesty had taken a marrow-bone upon her plate, and, after knocking\\nout the marrow, placed the bone again in the dish erect, as it stood\\nbefore; the dwarf, watching his opportunity, while Glumdalclitch was gone\\nto the side-board, mounted the stool that she stood on to take care of me\\nat meals, took me up in both hands, and squeezing my legs together,\\nwedged them into the marrow bone above my waist, where I stuck for some\\ntime, and made a very ridiculous figure.  I believe it was near a minute\\nbefore any one knew what was become of me; for I thought it below me to\\ncry out.  But, as princes seldom get their meat hot, my legs were not\\nscalded, only my stockings and breeches in a sad condition.  The dwarf,\\nat my entreaty, had no other punishment than a sound whipping.\\n\\nI was frequently rallied by the queen upon account of my fearfulness; and\\nshe used to ask me whether the people of my country were as great cowards\\nas myself?  The occasion was this: the kingdom is much pestered with\\nflies in summer; and these odious insects, each of them as big as a\\nDunstable lark, hardly gave me any rest while I sat at dinner, with their\\ncontinual humming and buzzing about mine ears.  They would sometimes\\nalight upon my victuals, and leave their loathsome excrement, or spawn\\nbehind, which to me was very visible, though not to the natives of that\\ncountry, whose large optics were not so acute as mine, in viewing smaller\\nobjects.  Sometimes they would fix upon my nose, or forehead, where they\\nstung me to the quick, smelling very offensively; and I could easily\\ntrace that viscous matter, which, our naturalists tell us, enables those\\ncreatures to walk with their feet upwards upon a ceiling.  I had much ado\\nto defend myself against these detestable animals, and could not forbear\\nstarting when they came on my face.  It was the common practice of the\\ndwarf, to catch a number of these insects in his hand, as schoolboys do\\namong us, and let them out suddenly under my nose, on purpose to frighten\\nme, and divert the queen.  My remedy was to cut them in pieces with my\\nknife, as they flew in the air, wherein my dexterity was much admired.\\n\\nI remember, one morning, when Glumdalclitch had set me in a box upon a\\nwindow, as she usually did in fair days to give me air (for I durst not\\nventure to let the box be hung on a nail out of the window, as we do with\\ncages in England), after I had lifted up one of my sashes, and sat down\\nat my table to eat a piece of sweet cake for my breakfast, above twenty\\nwasps, allured by the smell, came flying into the room, humming louder\\nthan the drones of as many bagpipes.  Some of them seized my cake, and\\ncarried it piecemeal away; others flew about my head and face,\\nconfounding me with the noise, and putting me in the utmost terror of\\ntheir stings.  However, I had the courage to rise and draw my hanger, and\\nattack them in the air.  I dispatched four of them, but the rest got\\naway, and I presently shut my window.  These insects were as large as\\npartridges: I took out their stings, found them an inch and a half long,\\nand as sharp as needles.  I carefully preserved them all; and having\\nsince shown them, with some other curiosities, in several parts of\\nEurope, upon my return to England I gave three of them to Gresham\\nCollege, and kept the fourth for myself.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\n\\nThe country described.  A proposal for correcting modern maps.  The\\nking’s palace; and some account of the metropolis.  The author’s way of\\ntravelling.  The chief temple described.\\n\\nI now intend to give the reader a short description of this country, as\\nfar as I travelled in it, which was not above two thousand miles round\\nLorbrulgrud, the metropolis.  For the queen, whom I always attended,\\nnever went farther when she accompanied the king in his progresses, and\\nthere staid till his majesty returned from viewing his frontiers.  The\\nwhole extent of this prince’s dominions reaches about six thousand miles\\nin length, and from three to five in breadth: whence I cannot but\\nconclude, that our geographers of Europe are in a great error, by\\nsupposing nothing but sea between Japan and California; for it was ever\\nmy opinion, that there must be a balance of earth to counterpoise the\\ngreat continent of Tartary; and therefore they ought to correct their\\nmaps and charts, by joining this vast tract of land to the north-west\\nparts of America, wherein I shall be ready to lend them my assistance.\\n\\nThe kingdom is a peninsula, terminated to the north-east by a ridge of\\nmountains thirty miles high, which are altogether impassable, by reason\\nof the volcanoes upon the tops: neither do the most learned know what\\nsort of mortals inhabit beyond those mountains, or whether they be\\ninhabited at all.  On the three other sides, it is bounded by the ocean.\\nThere is not one seaport in the whole kingdom: and those parts of the\\ncoasts into which the rivers issue, are so full of pointed rocks, and the\\nsea generally so rough, that there is no venturing with the smallest of\\ntheir boats; so that these people are wholly excluded from any commerce\\nwith the rest of the world.  But the large rivers are full of vessels,\\nand abound with excellent fish; for they seldom get any from the sea,\\nbecause the sea fish are of the same size with those in Europe, and\\nconsequently not worth catching; whereby it is manifest, that nature, in\\nthe production of plants and animals of so extraordinary a bulk, is\\nwholly confined to this continent, of which I leave the reasons to be\\ndetermined by philosophers.  However, now and then they take a whale that\\nhappens to be dashed against the rocks, which the common people feed on\\nheartily.  These whales I have known so large, that a man could hardly\\ncarry one upon his shoulders; and sometimes, for curiosity, they are\\nbrought in hampers to Lorbrulgrud; I saw one of them in a dish at the\\nking’s table, which passed for a rarity, but I did not observe he was\\nfond of it; for I think, indeed, the bigness disgusted him, although I\\nhave seen one somewhat larger in Greenland.\\n\\nThe country is well inhabited, for it contains fifty-one cities, near a\\nhundred walled towns, and a great number of villages.  To satisfy my\\ncurious reader, it may be sufficient to describe Lorbrulgrud.  This city\\nstands upon almost two equal parts, on each side the river that passes\\nthrough.  It contains above eighty thousand houses, and about six hundred\\nthousand inhabitants.  It is in length three _glomglungs_ (which make\\nabout fifty-four English miles,) and two and a half in breadth; as I\\nmeasured it myself in the royal map made by the king’s order, which was\\nlaid on the ground on purpose for me, and extended a hundred feet: I\\npaced the diameter and circumference several times barefoot, and,\\ncomputing by the scale, measured it pretty exactly.\\n\\nThe king’s palace is no regular edifice, but a heap of buildings, about\\nseven miles round: the chief rooms are generally two hundred and forty\\nfeet high, and broad and long in proportion.  A coach was allowed to\\nGlumdalclitch and me, wherein her governess frequently took her out to\\nsee the town, or go among the shops; and I was always of the party,\\ncarried in my box; although the girl, at my own desire, would often take\\nme out, and hold me in her hand, that I might more conveniently view the\\nhouses and the people, as we passed along the streets.  I reckoned our\\ncoach to be about a square of Westminster-hall, but not altogether so\\nhigh: however, I cannot be very exact.  One day the governess ordered our\\ncoachman to stop at several shops, where the beggars, watching their\\nopportunity, crowded to the sides of the coach, and gave me the most\\nhorrible spectacle that ever a European eye beheld.  There was a woman\\nwith a cancer in her breast, swelled to a monstrous size, full of holes,\\nin two or three of which I could have easily crept, and covered my whole\\nbody.  There was a fellow with a wen in his neck, larger than five\\nwool-packs; and another, with a couple of wooden legs, each about twenty\\nfeet high.  But the most hateful sight of all, was the lice crawling on\\ntheir clothes.  I could see distinctly the limbs of these vermin with my\\nnaked eye, much better than those of a European louse through a\\nmicroscope, and their snouts with which they rooted like swine.  They\\nwere the first I had ever beheld, and I should have been curious enough\\nto dissect one of them, if I had had proper instruments, which I\\nunluckily left behind me in the ship, although, indeed, the sight was so\\nnauseous, that it perfectly turned my stomach.\\n\\nBesides the large box in which I was usually carried, the queen ordered a\\nsmaller one to be made for me, of about twelve feet square, and ten high,\\nfor the convenience of travelling; because the other was somewhat too\\nlarge for Glumdalclitch’s lap, and cumbersome in the coach; it was made\\nby the same artist, whom I directed in the whole contrivance.  This\\ntravelling-closet was an exact square, with a window in the middle of\\nthree of the squares, and each window was latticed with iron wire on the\\noutside, to prevent accidents in long journeys.  On the fourth side,\\nwhich had no window, two strong staples were fixed, through which the\\nperson that carried me, when I had a mind to be on horseback, put a\\nleathern belt, and buckled it about his waist.  This was always the\\noffice of some grave trusty servant, in whom I could confide, whether I\\nattended the king and queen in their progresses, or were disposed to see\\nthe gardens, or pay a visit to some great lady or minister of state in\\nthe court, when Glumdalclitch happened to be out of order; for I soon\\nbegan to be known and esteemed among the greatest officers, I suppose\\nmore upon account of their majesties’ favour, than any merit of my own.\\nIn journeys, when I was weary of the coach, a servant on horseback would\\nbuckle on my box, and place it upon a cushion before him; and there I had\\na full prospect of the country on three sides, from my three windows.  I\\nhad, in this closet, a field-bed and a hammock, hung from the ceiling,\\ntwo chairs and a table, neatly screwed to the floor, to prevent being\\ntossed about by the agitation of the horse or the coach.  And having been\\nlong used to sea-voyages, those motions, although sometimes very violent,\\ndid not much discompose me.\\n\\nWhenever I had a mind to see the town, it was always in my\\ntravelling-closet; which Glumdalclitch held in her lap in a kind of open\\nsedan, after the fashion of the country, borne by four men, and attended\\nby two others in the queen’s livery.  The people, who had often heard of\\nme, were very curious to crowd about the sedan, and the girl was\\ncomplaisant enough to make the bearers stop, and to take me in her hand,\\nthat I might be more conveniently seen.\\n\\nI was very desirous to see the chief temple, and particularly the tower\\nbelonging to it, which is reckoned the highest in the kingdom.\\nAccordingly one day my nurse carried me thither, but I may truly say I\\ncame back disappointed; for the height is not above three thousand feet,\\nreckoning from the ground to the highest pinnacle top; which, allowing\\nfor the difference between the size of those people and us in Europe, is\\nno great matter for admiration, nor at all equal in proportion (if I\\nrightly remember) to Salisbury steeple.  But, not to detract from a\\nnation, to which, during my life, I shall acknowledge myself extremely\\nobliged, it must be allowed, that whatever this famous tower wants in\\nheight, is amply made up in beauty and strength: for the walls are near a\\nhundred feet thick, built of hewn stone, whereof each is about forty feet\\nsquare, and adorned on all sides with statues of gods and emperors, cut\\nin marble, larger than the life, placed in their several niches.  I\\nmeasured a little finger which had fallen down from one of these statues,\\nand lay unperceived among some rubbish, and found it exactly four feet\\nand an inch in length.  Glumdalclitch wrapped it up in her handkerchief,\\nand carried it home in her pocket, to keep among other trinkets, of which\\nthe girl was very fond, as children at her age usually are.\\n\\nThe king’s kitchen is indeed a noble building, vaulted at top, and about\\nsix hundred feet high.  The great oven is not so wide, by ten paces, as\\nthe cupola at St. Paul’s: for I measured the latter on purpose, after my\\nreturn.  But if I should describe the kitchen grate, the prodigious pots\\nand kettles, the joints of meat turning on the spits, with many other\\nparticulars, perhaps I should be hardly believed; at least a severe\\ncritic would be apt to think I enlarged a little, as travellers are often\\nsuspected to do.  To avoid which censure I fear I have run too much into\\nthe other extreme; and that if this treatise should happen to be\\ntranslated into the language of Brobdingnag (which is the general name of\\nthat kingdom,) and transmitted thither, the king and his people would\\nhave reason to complain that I had done them an injury, by a false and\\ndiminutive representation.\\n\\nHis majesty seldom keeps above six hundred horses in his stables: they\\nare generally from fifty-four to sixty feet high.  But, when he goes\\nabroad on solemn days, he is attended, for state, by a military guard of\\nfive hundred horse, which, indeed, I thought was the most splendid sight\\nthat could be ever beheld, till I saw part of his army in battalia,\\nwhereof I shall find another occasion to speak.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\n\\nSeveral adventurers that happened to the author.  The execution of a\\ncriminal.  The author shows his skill in navigation.\\n\\nI should have lived happy enough in that country, if my littleness had\\nnot exposed me to several ridiculous and troublesome accidents; some of\\nwhich I shall venture to relate.  Glumdalclitch often carried me into the\\ngardens of the court in my smaller box, and would sometimes take me out\\nof it, and hold me in her hand, or set me down to walk.  I remember,\\nbefore the dwarf left the queen, he followed us one day into those\\ngardens, and my nurse having set me down, he and I being close together,\\nnear some dwarf apple trees, I must needs show my wit, by a silly\\nallusion between him and the trees, which happens to hold in their\\nlanguage as it does in ours.  Whereupon, the malicious rogue, watching\\nhis opportunity, when I was walking under one of them, shook it directly\\nover my head, by which a dozen apples, each of them near as large as a\\nBristol barrel, came tumbling about my ears; one of them hit me on the\\nback as I chanced to stoop, and knocked me down flat on my face; but I\\nreceived no other hurt, and the dwarf was pardoned at my desire, because\\nI had given the provocation.\\n\\nAnother day, Glumdalclitch left me on a smooth grass-plot to divert\\nmyself, while she walked at some distance with her governess.  In the\\nmeantime, there suddenly fell such a violent shower of hail, that I was\\nimmediately by the force of it, struck to the ground: and when I was\\ndown, the hailstones gave me such cruel bangs all over the body, as if I\\nhad been pelted with tennis-balls; however, I made a shift to creep on\\nall fours, and shelter myself, by lying flat on my face, on the lee-side\\nof a border of lemon-thyme, but so bruised from head to foot, that I\\ncould not go abroad in ten days.  Neither is this at all to be wondered\\nat, because nature, in that country, observing the same proportion\\nthrough all her operations, a hailstone is near eighteen hundred times as\\nlarge as one in Europe; which I can assert upon experience, having been\\nso curious as to weigh and measure them.\\n\\nBut a more dangerous accident happened to me in the same garden, when my\\nlittle nurse, believing she had put me in a secure place (which I often\\nentreated her to do, that I might enjoy my own thoughts,) and having left\\nmy box at home, to avoid the trouble of carrying it, went to another part\\nof the garden with her governess and some ladies of her acquaintance.\\nWhile she was absent, and out of hearing, a small white spaniel that\\nbelonged to one of the chief gardeners, having got by accident into the\\ngarden, happened to range near the place where I lay: the dog, following\\nthe scent, came directly up, and taking me in his mouth, ran straight to\\nhis master wagging his tail, and set me gently on the ground.  By good\\nfortune he had been so well taught, that I was carried between his teeth\\nwithout the least hurt, or even tearing my clothes.  But the poor\\ngardener, who knew me well, and had a great kindness for me, was in a\\nterrible fright: he gently took me up in both his hands, and asked me how\\nI did? but I was so amazed and out of breath, that I could not speak a\\nword.  In a few minutes I came to myself, and he carried me safe to my\\nlittle nurse, who, by this time, had returned to the place where she left\\nme, and was in cruel agonies when I did not appear, nor answer when she\\ncalled.  She severely reprimanded the gardener on account of his dog.\\nBut the thing was hushed up, and never known at court, for the girl was\\nafraid of the queen’s anger; and truly, as to myself, I thought it would\\nnot be for my reputation, that such a story should go about.\\n\\nThis accident absolutely determined Glumdalclitch never to trust me\\nabroad for the future out of her sight.  I had been long afraid of this\\nresolution, and therefore concealed from her some little unlucky\\nadventures, that happened in those times when I was left by myself.  Once\\na kite, hovering over the garden, made a stoop at me, and if I had not\\nresolutely drawn my hanger, and run under a thick espalier, he would have\\ncertainly carried me away in his talons.  Another time, walking to the\\ntop of a fresh mole-hill, I fell to my neck in the hole, through which\\nthat animal had cast up the earth, and coined some lie, not worth\\nremembering, to excuse myself for spoiling my clothes.  I likewise broke\\nmy right shin against the shell of a snail, which I happened to stumble\\nover, as I was walking alone and thinking on poor England.\\n\\nI cannot tell whether I were more pleased or mortified to observe, in\\nthose solitary walks, that the smaller birds did not appear to be at all\\nafraid of me, but would hop about within a yard’s distance, looking for\\nworms and other food, with as much indifference and security as if no\\ncreature at all were near them.  I remember, a thrush had the confidence\\nto snatch out of my hand, with his bill, a of cake that Glumdalclitch had\\njust given me for my breakfast.  When I attempted to catch any of these\\nbirds, they would boldly turn against me, endeavouring to peck my\\nfingers, which I durst not venture within their reach; and then they\\nwould hop back unconcerned, to hunt for worms or snails, as they did\\nbefore.  But one day, I took a thick cudgel, and threw it with all my\\nstrength so luckily, at a linnet, that I knocked him down, and seizing\\nhim by the neck with both my hands, ran with him in triumph to my nurse.\\nHowever, the bird, who had only been stunned, recovering himself gave me\\nso many boxes with his wings, on both sides of my head and body, though I\\nheld him at arm’s-length, and was out of the reach of his claws, that I\\nwas twenty times thinking to let him go.  But I was soon relieved by one\\nof our servants, who wrung off the bird’s neck, and I had him next day\\nfor dinner, by the queen’s command.  This linnet, as near as I can\\nremember, seemed to be somewhat larger than an English swan.\\n\\nThe maids of honour often invited Glumdalclitch to their apartments, and\\ndesired she would bring me along with her, on purpose to have the\\npleasure of seeing and touching me.  They would often strip me naked from\\ntop to toe, and lay me at full length in their bosoms; wherewith I was\\nmuch disgusted because, to say the truth, a very offensive smell came\\nfrom their skins; which I do not mention, or intend, to the disadvantage\\nof those excellent ladies, for whom I have all manner of respect; but I\\nconceive that my sense was more acute in proportion to my littleness, and\\nthat those illustrious persons were no more disagreeable to their lovers,\\nor to each other, than people of the same quality are with us in England.\\nAnd, after all, I found their natural smell was much more supportable,\\nthan when they used perfumes, under which I immediately swooned away.  I\\ncannot forget, that an intimate friend of mine in Lilliput, took the\\nfreedom in a warm day, when I had used a good deal of exercise, to\\ncomplain of a strong smell about me, although I am as little faulty that\\nway, as most of my sex: but I suppose his faculty of smelling was as nice\\nwith regard to me, as mine was to that of this people.  Upon this point,\\nI cannot forbear doing justice to the queen my mistress, and\\nGlumdalclitch my nurse, whose persons were as sweet as those of any lady\\nin England.\\n\\nThat which gave me most uneasiness among these maids of honour (when my\\nnurse carried me to visit then) was, to see them use me without any\\nmanner of ceremony, like a creature who had no sort of consequence: for\\nthey would strip themselves to the skin, and put on their smocks in my\\npresence, while I was placed on their toilet, directly before their naked\\nbodies, which I am sure to me was very far from being a tempting sight,\\nor from giving me any other emotions than those of horror and disgust:\\ntheir skins appeared so coarse and uneven, so variously coloured, when I\\nsaw them near, with a mole here and there as broad as a trencher, and\\nhairs hanging from it thicker than packthreads, to say nothing farther\\nconcerning the rest of their persons.  Neither did they at all scruple,\\nwhile I was by, to discharge what they had drank, to the quantity of at\\nleast two hogsheads, in a vessel that held above three tuns.  The\\nhandsomest among these maids of honour, a pleasant, frolicsome girl of\\nsixteen, would sometimes set me astride upon one of her nipples, with\\nmany other tricks, wherein the reader will excuse me for not being over\\nparticular.  But I was so much displeased, that I entreated Glumdalclitch\\nto contrive some excuse for not seeing that young lady any more.\\n\\nOne day, a young gentleman, who was nephew to my nurse’s governess, came\\nand pressed them both to see an execution.  It was of a man, who had\\nmurdered one of that gentleman’s intimate acquaintance.  Glumdalclitch\\nwas prevailed on to be of the company, very much against her inclination,\\nfor she was naturally tender-hearted: and, as for myself, although I\\nabhorred such kind of spectacles, yet my curiosity tempted me to see\\nsomething that I thought must be extraordinary.  The malefactor was fixed\\nin a chair upon a scaffold erected for that purpose, and his head cut off\\nat one blow, with a sword of about forty feet long.  The veins and\\narteries spouted up such a prodigious quantity of blood, and so high in\\nthe air, that the great _jet d’eau_ at Versailles was not equal to it for\\nthe time it lasted: and the head, when it fell on the scaffold floor,\\ngave such a bounce as made me start, although I was at least half an\\nEnglish mile distant.\\n\\nThe queen, who often used to hear me talk of my sea-voyages, and took all\\noccasions to divert me when I was melancholy, asked me whether I\\nunderstood how to handle a sail or an oar, and whether a little exercise\\nof rowing might not be convenient for my health?  I answered, that I\\nunderstood both very well: for although my proper employment had been to\\nbe surgeon or doctor to the ship, yet often, upon a pinch, I was forced\\nto work like a common mariner.  But I could not see how this could be\\ndone in their country, where the smallest wherry was equal to a\\nfirst-rate man of war among us; and such a boat as I could manage would\\nnever live in any of their rivers.  Her majesty said, if I would contrive\\na boat, her own joiner should make it, and she would provide a place for\\nme to sail in.  The fellow was an ingenious workman, and by my\\ninstructions, in ten days, finished a pleasure-boat with all its\\ntackling, able conveniently to hold eight Europeans.  When it was\\nfinished, the queen was so delighted, that she ran with it in her lap to\\nthe king, who ordered it to be put into a cistern full of water, with me\\nin it, by way of trial, where I could not manage my two sculls, or little\\noars, for want of room.  But the queen had before contrived another\\nproject.  She ordered the joiner to make a wooden trough of three hundred\\nfeet long, fifty broad, and eight deep; which, being well pitched, to\\nprevent leaking, was placed on the floor, along the wall, in an outer\\nroom of the palace.  It had a cock near the bottom to let out the water,\\nwhen it began to grow stale; and two servants could easily fill it in\\nhalf an hour.  Here I often used to row for my own diversion, as well as\\nthat of the queen and her ladies, who thought themselves well entertained\\nwith my skill and agility.  Sometimes I would put up my sail, and then my\\nbusiness was only to steer, while the ladies gave me a gale with their\\nfans; and, when they were weary, some of their pages would blow my sail\\nforward with their breath, while I showed my art by steering starboard or\\nlarboard as I pleased.  When I had done, Glumdalclitch always carried\\nback my boat into her closet, and hung it on a nail to dry.\\n\\nIn this exercise I once met an accident, which had like to have cost me\\nmy life; for, one of the pages having put my boat into the trough, the\\ngoverness who attended Glumdalclitch very officiously lifted me up, to\\nplace me in the boat: but I happened to slip through her fingers, and\\nshould infallibly have fallen down forty feet upon the floor, if, by the\\nluckiest chance in the world, I had not been stopped by a corking-pin\\nthat stuck in the good gentlewoman’s stomacher; the head of the pin\\npassing between my shirt and the waistband of my breeches, and thus I was\\nheld by the middle in the air, till Glumdalclitch ran to my relief.\\n\\nAnother time, one of the servants, whose office it was to fill my trough\\nevery third day with fresh water, was so careless as to let a huge frog\\n(not perceiving it) slip out of his pail.  The frog lay concealed till I\\nwas put into my boat, but then, seeing a resting-place, climbed up, and\\nmade it lean so much on one side, that I was forced to balance it with\\nall my weight on the other, to prevent overturning.  When the frog was\\ngot in, it hopped at once half the length of the boat, and then over my\\nhead, backward and forward, daubing my face and clothes with its odious\\nslime.  The largeness of its features made it appear the most deformed\\nanimal that can be conceived.  However, I desired Glumdalclitch to let me\\ndeal with it alone.  I banged it a good while with one of my sculls, and\\nat last forced it to leap out of the boat.\\n\\nBut the greatest danger I ever underwent in that kingdom, was from a\\nmonkey, who belonged to one of the clerks of the kitchen.  Glumdalclitch\\nhad locked me up in her closet, while she went somewhere upon business,\\nor a visit.  The weather being very warm, the closet-window was left\\nopen, as well as the windows and the door of my bigger box, in which I\\nusually lived, because of its largeness and conveniency.  As I sat\\nquietly meditating at my table, I heard something bounce in at the\\ncloset-window, and skip about from one side to the other: whereat,\\nalthough I was much alarmed, yet I ventured to look out, but not stirring\\nfrom my seat; and then I saw this frolicsome animal frisking and leaping\\nup and down, till at last he came to my box, which he seemed to view with\\ngreat pleasure and curiosity, peeping in at the door and every window.  I\\nretreated to the farther corner of my room; or box; but the monkey\\nlooking in at every side, put me in such a fright, that I wanted presence\\nof mind to conceal myself under the bed, as I might easily have done.\\nAfter some time spent in peeping, grinning, and chattering, he at last\\nespied me; and reaching one of his paws in at the door, as a cat does\\nwhen she plays with a mouse, although I often shifted place to avoid him,\\nhe at length seized the lappet of my coat (which being made of that\\ncountry silk, was very thick and strong), and dragged me out.  He took me\\nup in his right fore-foot and held me as a nurse does a child she is\\ngoing to suckle, just as I have seen the same sort of creature do with a\\nkitten in Europe; and when I offered to struggle he squeezed me so hard,\\nthat I thought it more prudent to submit.  I have good reason to believe,\\nthat he took me for a young one of his own species, by his often stroking\\nmy face very gently with his other paw.  In these diversions he was\\ninterrupted by a noise at the closet door, as if somebody were opening\\nit: whereupon he suddenly leaped up to the window at which he had come\\nin, and thence upon the leads and gutters, walking upon three legs, and\\nholding me in the fourth, till he clambered up to a roof that was next to\\nours.  I heard Glumdalclitch give a shriek at the moment he was carrying\\nme out.  The poor girl was almost distracted: that quarter of the palace\\nwas all in an uproar; the servants ran for ladders; the monkey was seen\\nby hundreds in the court, sitting upon the ridge of a building, holding\\nme like a baby in one of his forepaws, and feeding me with the other, by\\ncramming into my mouth some victuals he had squeezed out of the bag on\\none side of his chaps, and patting me when I would not eat; whereat many\\nof the rabble below could not forbear laughing; neither do I think they\\njustly ought to be blamed, for, without question, the sight was\\nridiculous enough to every body but myself.  Some of the people threw up\\nstones, hoping to drive the monkey down; but this was strictly forbidden,\\nor else, very probably, my brains had been dashed out.\\n\\nThe ladders were now applied, and mounted by several men; which the\\nmonkey observing, and finding himself almost encompassed, not being able\\nto make speed enough with his three legs, let me drop on a ridge tile,\\nand made his escape.  Here I sat for some time, five hundred yards from\\nthe ground, expecting every moment to be blown down by the wind, or to\\nfall by my own giddiness, and come tumbling over and over from the ridge\\nto the eaves; but an honest lad, one of my nurse’s footmen, climbed up,\\nand putting me into his breeches pocket, brought me down safe.\\n\\nI was almost choked with the filthy stuff the monkey had crammed down my\\nthroat: but my dear little nurse picked it out of my mouth with a small\\nneedle, and then I fell a-vomiting, which gave me great relief.  Yet I\\nwas so weak and bruised in the sides with the squeezes given me by this\\nodious animal, that I was forced to keep my bed a fortnight.  The king,\\nqueen, and all the court, sent every day to inquire after my health; and\\nher majesty made me several visits during my sickness.  The monkey was\\nkilled, and an order made, that no such animal should be kept about the\\npalace.\\n\\nWhen I attended the king after my recovery, to return him thanks for his\\nfavours, he was pleased to rally me a good deal upon this adventure.  He\\nasked me, “what my thoughts and speculations were, while I lay in the\\nmonkey’s paw; how I liked the victuals he gave me; his manner of feeding;\\nand whether the fresh air on the roof had sharpened my stomach.”  He\\ndesired to know, “what I would have done upon such an occasion in my own\\ncountry.”  I told his majesty, “that in Europe we had no monkeys, except\\nsuch as were brought for curiosity from other places, and so small, that\\nI could deal with a dozen of them together, if they presumed to attack\\nme.  And as for that monstrous animal with whom I was so lately engaged\\n(it was indeed as large as an elephant), if my fears had suffered me to\\nthink so far as to make use of my hanger,” (looking fiercely, and\\nclapping my hand on the hilt, as I spoke) “when he poked his paw into my\\nchamber, perhaps I should have given him such a wound, as would have made\\nhim glad to withdraw it with more haste than he put it in.”  This I\\ndelivered in a firm tone, like a person who was jealous lest his courage\\nshould be called in question.  However, my speech produced nothing else\\nbeside a laud laughter, which all the respect due to his majesty from\\nthose about him could not make them contain.  This made me reflect, how\\nvain an attempt it is for a man to endeavour to do himself honour among\\nthose who are out of all degree of equality or comparison with him.  And\\nyet I have seen the moral of my own behaviour very frequent in England\\nsince my return; where a little contemptible varlet, without the least\\ntitle to birth, person, wit, or common sense, shall presume to look with\\nimportance, and put himself upon a foot with the greatest persons of the\\nkingdom.\\n\\nI was every day furnishing the court with some ridiculous story: and\\nGlumdalclitch, although she loved me to excess, yet was arch enough to\\ninform the queen, whenever I committed any folly that she thought would\\nbe diverting to her majesty.  The girl, who had been out of order, was\\ncarried by her governess to take the air about an hour’s distance, or\\nthirty miles from town.  They alighted out of the coach near a small\\nfoot-path in a field, and Glumdalclitch setting down my travelling box, I\\nwent out of it to walk.  There was a cow-dung in the path, and I must\\nneed try my activity by attempting to leap over it.  I took a run, but\\nunfortunately jumped short, and found myself just in the middle up to my\\nknees.  I waded through with some difficulty, and one of the footmen\\nwiped me as clean as he could with his handkerchief, for I was filthily\\nbemired; and my nurse confined me to my box, till we returned home; where\\nthe queen was soon informed of what had passed, and the footmen spread it\\nabout the court: so that all the mirth for some days was at my expense.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\n\\nSeveral contrivances of the author to please the king and queen.  He\\nshows his skill in music.  The king inquires into the state of England,\\nwhich the author relates to him.  The king’s observations thereon.\\n\\nI used to attend the king’s levee once or twice a week, and had often\\nseen him under the barber’s hand, which indeed was at first very terrible\\nto behold; for the razor was almost twice as long as an ordinary scythe.\\nHis majesty, according to the custom of the country, was only shaved\\ntwice a-week.  I once prevailed on the barber to give me some of the suds\\nor lather, out of which I picked forty or fifty of the strongest stumps\\nof hair.  I then took a piece of fine wood, and cut it like the back of a\\ncomb, making several holes in it at equal distances with as small a\\nneedle as I could get from Glumdalclitch.  I fixed in the stumps so\\nartificially, scraping and sloping them with my knife toward the points,\\nthat I made a very tolerable comb; which was a seasonable supply, my own\\nbeing so much broken in the teeth, that it was almost useless: neither\\ndid I know any artist in that country so nice and exact, as would\\nundertake to make me another.\\n\\nAnd this puts me in mind of an amusement, wherein I spent many of my\\nleisure hours.  I desired the queen’s woman to save for me the combings\\nof her majesty’s hair, whereof in time I got a good quantity; and\\nconsulting with my friend the cabinet-maker, who had received general\\norders to do little jobs for me, I directed him to make two chair-frames,\\nno larger than those I had in my box, and to bore little holes with a\\nfine awl, round those parts where I designed the backs and seats; through\\nthese holes I wove the strongest hairs I could pick out, just after the\\nmanner of cane chairs in England.  When they were finished, I made a\\npresent of them to her majesty; who kept them in her cabinet, and used to\\nshow them for curiosities, as indeed they were the wonder of every one\\nthat beheld them.  The queen would have me sit upon one of these chairs,\\nbut I absolutely refused to obey her, protesting I would rather die than\\nplace a dishonourable part of my body on those precious hairs, that once\\nadorned her majesty’s head.  Of these hairs (as I had always a mechanical\\ngenius) I likewise made a neat little purse, about five feet long, with\\nher majesty’s name deciphered in gold letters, which I gave to\\nGlumdalclitch, by the queen’s consent.  To say the truth, it was more for\\nshow than use, being not of strength to bear the weight of the larger\\ncoins, and therefore she kept nothing in it but some little toys that\\ngirls are fond of.\\n\\nThe king, who delighted in music, had frequent concerts at court, to\\nwhich I was sometimes carried, and set in my box on a table to hear them:\\nbut the noise was so great that I could hardly distinguish the tunes.  I\\nam confident that all the drums and trumpets of a royal army, beating and\\nsounding together just at your ears, could not equal it.  My practice was\\nto have my box removed from the place where the performers sat, as far as\\nI could, then to shut the doors and windows of it, and draw the window\\ncurtains; after which I found their music not disagreeable.\\n\\nI had learned in my youth to play a little upon the spinet.\\nGlumdalclitch kept one in her chamber, and a master attended twice a-week\\nto teach her: I called it a spinet, because it somewhat resembled that\\ninstrument, and was played upon in the same manner.  A fancy came into my\\nhead, that I would entertain the king and queen with an English tune upon\\nthis instrument.  But this appeared extremely difficult: for the spinet\\nwas near sixty feet long, each key being almost a foot wide, so that with\\nmy arms extended I could not reach to above five keys, and to press them\\ndown required a good smart stroke with my fist, which would be too great\\na labour, and to no purpose.  The method I contrived was this: I prepared\\ntwo round sticks, about the bigness of common cudgels; they were thicker\\nat one end than the other, and I covered the thicker ends with pieces of\\na mouse’s skin, that by rapping on them I might neither damage the tops\\nof the keys nor interrupt the sound.  Before the spinet a bench was\\nplaced, about four feet below the keys, and I was put upon the bench.  I\\nran sideling upon it, that way and this, as fast as I could, banging the\\nproper keys with my two sticks, and made a shift to play a jig, to the\\ngreat satisfaction of both their majesties; but it was the most violent\\nexercise I ever underwent; and yet I could not strike above sixteen keys,\\nnor consequently play the bass and treble together, as other artists do;\\nwhich was a great disadvantage to my performance.\\n\\nThe king, who, as I before observed, was a prince of excellent\\nunderstanding, would frequently order that I should be brought in my box,\\nand set upon the table in his closet: he would then command me to bring\\none of my chairs out of the box, and sit down within three yards distance\\nupon the top of the cabinet, which brought me almost to a level with his\\nface.  In this manner I had several conversations with him.  I one day\\ntook the freedom to tell his majesty, “that the contempt he discovered\\ntowards Europe, and the rest of the world, did not seem answerable to\\nthose excellent qualities of mind that he was master of; that reason did\\nnot extend itself with the bulk of the body; on the contrary, we observed\\nin our country, that the tallest persons were usually the least provided\\nwith it; that among other animals, bees and ants had the reputation of\\nmore industry, art, and sagacity, than many of the larger kinds; and\\nthat, as inconsiderable as he took me to be, I hoped I might live to do\\nhis majesty some signal service.”  The king heard me with attention, and\\nbegan to conceive a much better opinion of me than he had ever before.\\nHe desired “I would give him as exact an account of the government of\\nEngland as I possibly could; because, as fond as princes commonly are of\\ntheir own customs (for so he conjectured of other monarchs, by my former\\ndiscourses), he should be glad to hear of any thing that might deserve\\nimitation.”\\n\\nImagine with thyself, courteous reader, how often I then wished for the\\ntongue of Demosthenes or Cicero, that might have enabled me to celebrate\\nthe praise of my own dear native country in a style equal to its merits\\nand felicity.\\n\\nI began my discourse by informing his majesty, that our dominions\\nconsisted of two islands, which composed three mighty kingdoms, under one\\nsovereign, beside our plantations in America.  I dwelt long upon the\\nfertility of our soil, and the temperature of our climate.  I then spoke\\nat large upon the constitution of an English parliament; partly made up\\nof an illustrious body called the House of Peers; persons of the noblest\\nblood, and of the most ancient and ample patrimonies.  I described that\\nextraordinary care always taken of their education in arts and arms, to\\nqualify them for being counsellors both to the king and kingdom; to have\\na share in the legislature; to be members of the highest court of\\njudicature, whence there can be no appeal; and to be champions always\\nready for the defence of their prince and country, by their valour,\\nconduct, and fidelity.  That these were the ornament and bulwark of the\\nkingdom, worthy followers of their most renowned ancestors, whose honour\\nhad been the reward of their virtue, from which their posterity were\\nnever once known to degenerate.  To these were joined several holy\\npersons, as part of that assembly, under the title of bishops, whose\\npeculiar business is to take care of religion, and of those who instruct\\nthe people therein.  These were searched and sought out through the whole\\nnation, by the prince and his wisest counsellors, among such of the\\npriesthood as were most deservedly distinguished by the sanctity of their\\nlives, and the depth of their erudition; who were indeed the spiritual\\nfathers of the clergy and the people.\\n\\nThat the other part of the parliament consisted of an assembly called the\\nHouse of Commons, who were all principal gentlemen, freely picked and\\nculled out by the people themselves, for their great abilities and love\\nof their country, to represent the wisdom of the whole nation.  And that\\nthese two bodies made up the most august assembly in Europe; to whom, in\\nconjunction with the prince, the whole legislature is committed.\\n\\nI then descended to the courts of justice; over which the judges, those\\nvenerable sages and interpreters of the law, presided, for determining\\nthe disputed rights and properties of men, as well as for the punishment\\nof vice and protection of innocence.  I mentioned the prudent management\\nof our treasury; the valour and achievements of our forces, by sea and\\nland.  I computed the number of our people, by reckoning how many\\nmillions there might be of each religious sect, or political party among\\nus.  I did not omit even our sports and pastimes, or any other particular\\nwhich I thought might redound to the honour of my country.  And I\\nfinished all with a brief historical account of affairs and events in\\nEngland for about a hundred years past.\\n\\nThis conversation was not ended under five audiences, each of several\\nhours; and the king heard the whole with great attention, frequently\\ntaking notes of what I spoke, as well as memorandums of what questions he\\nintended to ask me.\\n\\nWhen I had put an end to these long discources, his majesty, in a sixth\\naudience, consulting his notes, proposed many doubts, queries, and\\nobjections, upon every article.  He asked, “What methods were used to\\ncultivate the minds and bodies of our young nobility, and in what kind of\\nbusiness they commonly spent the first and teachable parts of their\\nlives?  What course was taken to supply that assembly, when any noble\\nfamily became extinct?  What qualifications were necessary in those who\\nare to be created new lords: whether the humour of the prince, a sum of\\nmoney to a court lady, or a design of strengthening a party opposite to\\nthe public interest, ever happened to be the motive in those\\nadvancements?  What share of knowledge these lords had in the laws of\\ntheir country, and how they came by it, so as to enable them to decide\\nthe properties of their fellow-subjects in the last resort?  Whether they\\nwere always so free from avarice, partialities, or want, that a bribe, or\\nsome other sinister view, could have no place among them?  Whether those\\nholy lords I spoke of were always promoted to that rank upon account of\\ntheir knowledge in religious matters, and the sanctity of their lives;\\nhad never been compliers with the times, while they were common priests;\\nor slavish prostitute chaplains to some nobleman, whose opinions they\\ncontinued servilely to follow, after they were admitted into that\\nassembly?”\\n\\nHe then desired to know, “What arts were practised in electing those whom\\nI called commoners: whether a stranger, with a strong purse, might not\\ninfluence the vulgar voters to choose him before their own landlord, or\\nthe most considerable gentleman in the neighbourhood?  How it came to\\npass, that people were so violently bent upon getting into this assembly,\\nwhich I allowed to be a great trouble and expense, often to the ruin of\\ntheir families, without any salary or pension? because this appeared such\\nan exalted strain of virtue and public spirit, that his majesty seemed to\\ndoubt it might possibly not be always sincere.”  And he desired to know,\\n“Whether such zealous gentlemen could have any views of refunding\\nthemselves for the charges and trouble they were at by sacrificing the\\npublic good to the designs of a weak and vicious prince, in conjunction\\nwith a corrupted ministry?”  He multiplied his questions, and sifted me\\nthoroughly upon every part of this head, proposing numberless inquiries\\nand objections, which I think it not prudent or convenient to repeat.\\n\\nUpon what I said in relation to our courts of justice, his majesty\\ndesired to be satisfied in several points: and this I was the better able\\nto do, having been formerly almost ruined by a long suit in chancery,\\nwhich was decreed for me with costs.  He asked, “What time was usually\\nspent in determining between right and wrong, and what degree of expense?\\nWhether advocates and orators had liberty to plead in causes manifestly\\nknown to be unjust, vexatious, or oppressive?  Whether party, in religion\\nor politics, were observed to be of any weight in the scale of justice?\\nWhether those pleading orators were persons educated in the general\\nknowledge of equity, or only in provincial, national, and other local\\ncustoms?  Whether they or their judges had any part in penning those\\nlaws, which they assumed the liberty of interpreting, and glossing upon\\nat their pleasure?  Whether they had ever, at different times, pleaded\\nfor and against the same cause, and cited precedents to prove contrary\\nopinions?  Whether they were a rich or a poor corporation?  Whether they\\nreceived any pecuniary reward for pleading, or delivering their opinions?\\nAnd particularly, whether they were ever admitted as members in the lower\\nsenate?”\\n\\nHe fell next upon the management of our treasury; and said, “he thought\\nmy memory had failed me, because I computed our taxes at about five or\\nsix millions a-year, and when I came to mention the issues, he found they\\nsometimes amounted to more than double; for the notes he had taken were\\nvery particular in this point, because he hoped, as he told me, that the\\nknowledge of our conduct might be useful to him, and he could not be\\ndeceived in his calculations.  But, if what I told him were true, he was\\nstill at a loss how a kingdom could run out of its estate, like a private\\nperson.”  He asked me, “who were our creditors; and where we found money\\nto pay them?”  He wondered to hear me talk of such chargeable and\\nexpensive wars; “that certainly we must be a quarrelsome people, or live\\namong very bad neighbours, and that our generals must needs be richer\\nthan our kings.”  He asked, what business we had out of our own islands,\\nunless upon the score of trade, or treaty, or to defend the coasts with\\nour fleet?”  Above all, he was amazed to hear me talk of a mercenary\\nstanding army, in the midst of peace, and among a free people.  He said,\\n“if we were governed by our own consent, in the persons of our\\nrepresentatives, he could not imagine of whom we were afraid, or against\\nwhom we were to fight; and would hear my opinion, whether a private man’s\\nhouse might not be better defended by himself, his children, and family,\\nthan by half-a-dozen rascals, picked up at a venture in the streets for\\nsmall wages, who might get a hundred times more by cutting their\\nthroats?”\\n\\nHe laughed at my “odd kind of arithmetic,” as he was pleased to call it,\\n“in reckoning the numbers of our people, by a computation drawn from the\\nseveral sects among us, in religion and politics.”  He said, “he knew no\\nreason why those, who entertain opinions prejudicial to the public,\\nshould be obliged to change, or should not be obliged to conceal them.\\nAnd as it was tyranny in any government to require the first, so it was\\nweakness not to enforce the second: for a man may be allowed to keep\\npoisons in his closet, but not to vend them about for cordials.”\\n\\nHe observed, “that among the diversions of our nobility and gentry, I had\\nmentioned gaming: he desired to know at what age this entertainment was\\nusually taken up, and when it was laid down; how much of their time it\\nemployed; whether it ever went so high as to affect their fortunes;\\nwhether mean, vicious people, by their dexterity in that art, might not\\narrive at great riches, and sometimes keep our very nobles in dependence,\\nas well as habituate them to vile companions, wholly take them from the\\nimprovement of their minds, and force them, by the losses they received,\\nto learn and practise that infamous dexterity upon others?”\\n\\nHe was perfectly astonished with the historical account gave him of our\\naffairs during the last century; protesting “it was only a heap of\\nconspiracies, rebellions, murders, massacres, revolutions, banishments,\\nthe very worst effects that avarice, faction, hypocrisy, perfidiousness,\\ncruelty, rage, madness, hatred, envy, lust, malice, and ambition, could\\nproduce.”\\n\\nHis majesty, in another audience, was at the pains to recapitulate the\\nsum of all I had spoken; compared the questions he made with the answers\\nI had given; then taking me into his hands, and stroking me gently,\\ndelivered himself in these words, which I shall never forget, nor the\\nmanner he spoke them in: “My little friend Grildrig, you have made a most\\nadmirable panegyric upon your country; you have clearly proved, that\\nignorance, idleness, and vice, are the proper ingredients for qualifying\\na legislator; that laws are best explained, interpreted, and applied, by\\nthose whose interest and abilities lie in perverting, confounding, and\\neluding them.  I observe among you some lines of an institution, which,\\nin its original, might have been tolerable, but these half erased, and\\nthe rest wholly blurred and blotted by corruptions.  It does not appear,\\nfrom all you have said, how any one perfection is required toward the\\nprocurement of any one station among you; much less, that men are\\nennobled on account of their virtue; that priests are advanced for their\\npiety or learning; soldiers, for their conduct or valour; judges, for\\ntheir integrity; senators, for the love of their country; or counsellors\\nfor their wisdom.  As for yourself,” continued the king, “who have spent\\nthe greatest part of your life in travelling, I am well disposed to hope\\nyou may hitherto have escaped many vices of your country.  But by what I\\nhave gathered from your own relation, and the answers I have with much\\npains wrung and extorted from you, I cannot but conclude the bulk of your\\nnatives to be the most pernicious race of little odious vermin that\\nnature ever suffered to crawl upon the surface of the earth.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\n\\nThe author’s love of his country.  He makes a proposal of much advantage\\nto the king, which is rejected.  The king’s great ignorance in politics.\\nThe learning of that country very imperfect and confined.  The laws, and\\nmilitary affairs, and parties in the state.\\n\\nNothing but an extreme love of truth could have hindered me from\\nconcealing this part of my story.  It was in vain to discover my\\nresentments, which were always turned into ridicule; and I was forced to\\nrest with patience, while my noble and beloved country was so injuriously\\ntreated.  I am as heartily sorry as any of my readers can possibly be,\\nthat such an occasion was given: but this prince happened to be so\\ncurious and inquisitive upon every particular, that it could not consist\\neither with gratitude or good manners, to refuse giving him what\\nsatisfaction I was able.  Yet thus much I may be allowed to say in my own\\nvindication, that I artfully eluded many of his questions, and gave to\\nevery point a more favourable turn, by many degrees, than the strictness\\nof truth would allow.  For I have always borne that laudable partiality\\nto my own country, which Dionysius Halicarnassensis, with so much\\njustice, recommends to an historian: I would hide the frailties and\\ndeformities of my political mother, and place her virtues and beauties in\\nthe most advantageous light.  This was my sincere endeavour in those many\\ndiscourses I had with that monarch, although it unfortunately failed of\\nsuccess.\\n\\nBut great allowances should be given to a king, who lives wholly secluded\\nfrom the rest of the world, and must therefore be altogether unacquainted\\nwith the manners and customs that most prevail in other nations: the want\\nof which knowledge will ever produce many prejudices, and a certain\\nnarrowness of thinking, from which we, and the politer countries of\\nEurope, are wholly exempted.  And it would be hard indeed, if so remote a\\nprince’s notions of virtue and vice were to be offered as a standard for\\nall mankind.\\n\\nTo confirm what I have now said, and further to show the miserable\\neffects of a confined education, I shall here insert a passage, which\\nwill hardly obtain belief.  In hopes to ingratiate myself further into\\nhis majesty’s favour, I told him of “an invention, discovered between\\nthree and four hundred years ago, to make a certain powder, into a heap\\nof which, the smallest spark of fire falling, would kindle the whole in a\\nmoment, although it were as big as a mountain, and make it all fly up in\\nthe air together, with a noise and agitation greater than thunder.  That\\na proper quantity of this powder rammed into a hollow tube of brass or\\niron, according to its bigness, would drive a ball of iron or lead, with\\nsuch violence and speed, as nothing was able to sustain its force.  That\\nthe largest balls thus discharged, would not only destroy whole ranks of\\nan army at once, but batter the strongest walls to the ground, sink down\\nships, with a thousand men in each, to the bottom of the sea, and when\\nlinked together by a chain, would cut through masts and rigging, divide\\nhundreds of bodies in the middle, and lay all waste before them.  That we\\noften put this powder into large hollow balls of iron, and discharged\\nthem by an engine into some city we were besieging, which would rip up\\nthe pavements, tear the houses to pieces, burst and throw splinters on\\nevery side, dashing out the brains of all who came near.  That I knew the\\ningredients very well, which were cheap and common; I understood the\\nmanner of compounding them, and could direct his workmen how to make\\nthose tubes, of a size proportionable to all other things in his\\nmajesty’s kingdom, and the largest need not be above a hundred feet long;\\ntwenty or thirty of which tubes, charged with the proper quantity of\\npowder and balls, would batter down the walls of the strongest town in\\nhis dominions in a few hours, or destroy the whole metropolis, if ever it\\nshould pretend to dispute his absolute commands.”  This I humbly offered\\nto his majesty, as a small tribute of acknowledgment, in turn for so many\\nmarks that I had received, of his royal favour and protection.\\n\\nThe king was struck with horror at the description I had given of those\\nterrible engines, and the proposal I had made.  “He was amazed, how so\\nimpotent and grovelling an insect as I” (these were his expressions)\\n“could entertain such inhuman ideas, and in so familiar a manner, as to\\nappear wholly unmoved at all the scenes of blood and desolation which I\\nhad painted as the common effects of those destructive machines;\\nwhereof,” he said, “some evil genius, enemy to mankind, must have been\\nthe first contriver.  As for himself, he protested, that although few\\nthings delighted him so much as new discoveries in art or in nature, yet\\nhe would rather lose half his kingdom, than be privy to such a secret;\\nwhich he commanded me, as I valued any life, never to mention any more.”\\n\\nA strange effect of narrow principles and views! that a prince possessed\\nof every quality which procures veneration, love, and esteem; of strong\\nparts, great wisdom, and profound learning, endowed with admirable\\ntalents, and almost adored by his subjects, should, from a nice,\\nunnecessary scruple, whereof in Europe we can have no conception, let\\nslip an opportunity put into his hands that would have made him absolute\\nmaster of the lives, the liberties, and the fortunes of his people!\\nNeither do I say this, with the least intention to detract from the many\\nvirtues of that excellent king, whose character, I am sensible, will, on\\nthis account, be very much lessened in the opinion of an English reader:\\nbut I take this defect among them to have risen from their ignorance, by\\nnot having hitherto reduced politics into a science, as the more acute\\nwits of Europe have done.  For, I remember very well, in a discourse one\\nday with the king, when I happened to say, “there were several thousand\\nbooks among us written upon the art of government,” it gave him (directly\\ncontrary to my intention) a very mean opinion of our understandings.  He\\nprofessed both to abominate and despise all mystery, refinement, and\\nintrigue, either in a prince or a minister.  He could not tell what I\\nmeant by secrets of state, where an enemy, or some rival nation, were not\\nin the case.  He confined the knowledge of governing within very narrow\\nbounds, to common sense and reason, to justice and lenity, to the speedy\\ndetermination of civil and criminal causes; with some other obvious\\ntopics, which are not worth considering.  And he gave it for his opinion,\\n“that whoever could make two ears of corn, or two blades of grass, to\\ngrow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before, would deserve\\nbetter of mankind, and do more essential service to his country, than the\\nwhole race of politicians put together.”\\n\\nThe learning of this people is very defective, consisting only in\\nmorality, history, poetry, and mathematics, wherein they must be allowed\\nto excel.  But the last of these is wholly applied to what may be useful\\nin life, to the improvement of agriculture, and all mechanical arts; so\\nthat among us, it would be little esteemed.  And as to ideas, entities,\\nabstractions, and transcendentals, I could never drive the least\\nconception into their heads.\\n\\nNo law in that country must exceed in words the number of letters in\\ntheir alphabet, which consists only of two and twenty.  But indeed few of\\nthem extend even to that length.  They are expressed in the most plain\\nand simple terms, wherein those people are not mercurial enough to\\ndiscover above one interpretation: and to write a comment upon any law,\\nis a capital crime.  As to the decision of civil causes, or proceedings\\nagainst criminals, their precedents are so few, that they have little\\nreason to boast of any extraordinary skill in either.\\n\\nThey have had the art of printing, as well as the Chinese, time out of\\nmind: but their libraries are not very large; for that of the king, which\\nis reckoned the largest, does not amount to above a thousand volumes,\\nplaced in a gallery of twelve hundred feet long, whence I had liberty to\\nborrow what books I pleased.  The queen’s joiner had contrived in one of\\nGlumdalclitch’s rooms, a kind of wooden machine five-and-twenty feet\\nhigh, formed like a standing ladder; the steps were each fifty feet long.\\nIt was indeed a moveable pair of stairs, the lowest end placed at ten\\nfeet distance from the wall of the chamber.  The book I had a mind to\\nread, was put up leaning against the wall: I first mounted to the upper\\nstep of the ladder, and turning my face towards the book, began at the\\ntop of the page, and so walking to the right and left about eight or ten\\npaces, according to the length of the lines, till I had gotten a little\\nbelow the level of mine eyes, and then descending gradually till I came\\nto the bottom: after which I mounted again, and began the other page in\\nthe same manner, and so turned over the leaf, which I could easily do\\nwith both my hands, for it was as thick and stiff as a pasteboard, and in\\nthe largest folios not above eighteen or twenty feet long.\\n\\nTheir style is clear, masculine, and smooth, but not florid; for they\\navoid nothing more than multiplying unnecessary words, or using various\\nexpressions.  I have perused many of their books, especially those in\\nhistory and morality.  Among the rest, I was much diverted with a little\\nold treatise, which always lay in Glumdalclitch’s bed chamber, and\\nbelonged to her governess, a grave elderly gentlewoman, who dealt in\\nwritings of morality and devotion.  The book treats of the weakness of\\nhuman kind, and is in little esteem, except among the women and the\\nvulgar.  However, I was curious to see what an author of that country\\ncould say upon such a subject.  This writer went through all the usual\\ntopics of European moralists, showing “how diminutive, contemptible, and\\nhelpless an animal was man in his own nature; how unable to defend\\nhimself from inclemencies of the air, or the fury of wild beasts: how\\nmuch he was excelled by one creature in strength, by another in speed, by\\na third in foresight, by a fourth in industry.”  He added, “that nature\\nwas degenerated in these latter declining ages of the world, and could\\nnow produce only small abortive births, in comparison of those in ancient\\ntimes.”  He said “it was very reasonable to think, not only that the\\nspecies of men were originally much larger, but also that there must have\\nbeen giants in former ages; which, as it is asserted by history and\\ntradition, so it has been confirmed by huge bones and skulls, casually\\ndug up in several parts of the kingdom, far exceeding the common dwindled\\nrace of men in our days.”  He argued, “that the very laws of nature\\nabsolutely required we should have been made, in the beginning of a size\\nmore large and robust; not so liable to destruction from every little\\naccident, of a tile falling from a house, or a stone cast from the hand\\nof a boy, or being drowned in a little brook.”  From this way of\\nreasoning, the author drew several moral applications, useful in the\\nconduct of life, but needless here to repeat.  For my own part, I could\\nnot avoid reflecting how universally this talent was spread, of drawing\\nlectures in morality, or indeed rather matter of discontent and repining,\\nfrom the quarrels we raise with nature.  And I believe, upon a strict\\ninquiry, those quarrels might be shown as ill-grounded among us as they\\nare among that people.\\n\\nAs to their military affairs, they boast that the king’s army consists of\\na hundred and seventy-six thousand foot, and thirty-two thousand horse:\\nif that may be called an army, which is made up of tradesmen in the\\nseveral cities, and farmers in the country, whose commanders are only the\\nnobility and gentry, without pay or reward.  They are indeed perfect\\nenough in their exercises, and under very good discipline, wherein I saw\\nno great merit; for how should it be otherwise, where every farmer is\\nunder the command of his own landlord, and every citizen under that of\\nthe principal men in his own city, chosen after the manner of Venice, by\\nballot?\\n\\nI have often seen the militia of Lorbrulgrud drawn out to exercise, in a\\ngreat field near the city of twenty miles square.  They were in all not\\nabove twenty-five thousand foot, and six thousand horse; but it was\\nimpossible for me to compute their number, considering the space of\\nground they took up.  A cavalier, mounted on a large steed, might be\\nabout ninety feet high.  I have seen this whole body of horse, upon a\\nword of command, draw their swords at once, and brandish them in the air.\\nImagination can figure nothing so grand, so surprising, and so\\nastonishing! it looked as if ten thousand flashes of lightning were\\ndarting at the same time from every quarter of the sky.\\n\\nI was curious to know how this prince, to whose dominions there is no\\naccess from any other country, came to think of armies, or to teach his\\npeople the practice of military discipline.  But I was soon informed,\\nboth by conversation and reading their histories; for, in the course of\\nmany ages, they have been troubled with the same disease to which the\\nwhole race of mankind is subject; the nobility often contending for\\npower, the people for liberty, and the king for absolute dominion.  All\\nwhich, however happily tempered by the laws of that kingdom, have been\\nsometimes violated by each of the three parties, and have more than once\\noccasioned civil wars; the last whereof was happily put an end to by this\\nprince’s grand-father, in a general composition; and the militia, then\\nsettled with common consent, has been ever since kept in the strictest\\nduty.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\n\\nThe king and queen make a progress to the frontiers.  The author attends\\nthem.  The manner in which he leaves the country very particularly\\nrelated.  He returns to England.\\n\\nI had always a strong impulse that I should some time recover my liberty,\\nthough it was impossible to conjecture by what means, or to form any\\nproject with the least hope of succeeding.  The ship in which I sailed,\\nwas the first ever known to be driven within sight of that coast, and the\\nking had given strict orders, that if at any time another appeared, it\\nshould be taken ashore, and with all its crew and passengers brought in a\\ntumbril to Lorbrulgrud.  He was strongly bent to get me a woman of my own\\nsize, by whom I might propagate the breed: but I think I should rather\\nhave died than undergone the disgrace of leaving a posterity to be kept\\nin cages, like tame canary-birds, and perhaps, in time, sold about the\\nkingdom, to persons of quality, for curiosities.  I was indeed treated\\nwith much kindness: I was the favourite of a great king and queen, and\\nthe delight of the whole court; but it was upon such a foot as ill became\\nthe dignity of humankind.  I could never forget those domestic pledges I\\nhad left behind me.  I wanted to be among people, with whom I could\\nconverse upon even terms, and walk about the streets and fields without\\nbeing afraid of being trod to death like a frog or a young puppy.  But my\\ndeliverance came sooner than I expected, and in a manner not very common;\\nthe whole story and circumstances of which I shall faithfully relate.\\n\\nI had now been two years in this country; and about the beginning of the\\nthird, Glumdalclitch and I attended the king and queen, in a progress to\\nthe south coast of the kingdom.  I was carried, as usual, in my\\ntravelling-box, which as I have already described, was a very convenient\\ncloset, of twelve feet wide.  And I had ordered a hammock to be fixed, by\\nsilken ropes from the four corners at the top, to break the jolts, when a\\nservant carried me before him on horseback, as I sometimes desired; and\\nwould often sleep in my hammock, while we were upon the road.  On the\\nroof of my closet, not directly over the middle of the hammock, I ordered\\nthe joiner to cut out a hole of a foot square, to give me air in hot\\nweather, as I slept; which hole I shut at pleasure with a board that drew\\nbackward and forward through a groove.\\n\\nWhen we came to our journey’s end, the king thought proper to pass a few\\ndays at a palace he has near Flanflasnic, a city within eighteen English\\nmiles of the seaside.  Glumdalclitch and I were much fatigued: I had\\ngotten a small cold, but the poor girl was so ill as to be confined to\\nher chamber.  I longed to see the ocean, which must be the only scene of\\nmy escape, if ever it should happen.  I pretended to be worse than I\\nreally was, and desired leave to take the fresh air of the sea, with a\\npage, whom I was very fond of, and who had sometimes been trusted with\\nme.  I shall never forget with what unwillingness Glumdalclitch\\nconsented, nor the strict charge she gave the page to be careful of me,\\nbursting at the same time into a flood of tears, as if she had some\\nforboding of what was to happen.  The boy took me out in my box, about\\nhalf an hours walk from the palace, towards the rocks on the sea-shore.\\nI ordered him to set me down, and lifting up one of my sashes, cast many\\na wistful melancholy look towards the sea.  I found myself not very well,\\nand told the page that I had a mind to take a nap in my hammock, which I\\nhoped would do me good.  I got in, and the boy shut the window close\\ndown, to keep out the cold.  I soon fell asleep, and all I can conjecture\\nis, while I slept, the page, thinking no danger could happen, went among\\nthe rocks to look for birds’ eggs, having before observed him from my\\nwindow searching about, and picking up one or two in the clefts.  Be that\\nas it will, I found myself suddenly awaked with a violent pull upon the\\nring, which was fastened at the top of my box for the conveniency of\\ncarriage.  I felt my box raised very high in the air, and then borne\\nforward with prodigious speed.  The first jolt had like to have shaken me\\nout of my hammock, but afterward the motion was easy enough.  I called\\nout several times, as loud as I could raise my voice, but all to no\\npurpose.  I looked towards my windows, and could see nothing but the\\nclouds and sky.  I heard a noise just over my head, like the clapping of\\nwings, and then began to perceive the woful condition I was in; that some\\neagle had got the ring of my box in his beak, with an intent to let it\\nfall on a rock, like a tortoise in a shell, and then pick out my body,\\nand devour it: for the sagacity and smell of this bird enables him to\\ndiscover his quarry at a great distance, though better concealed than I\\ncould be within a two-inch board.\\n\\nIn a little time, I observed the noise and flutter of wings to increase\\nvery fast, and my box was tossed up and down, like a sign in a windy day.\\nI heard several bangs or buffets, as I thought given to the eagle (for\\nsuch I am certain it must have been that held the ring of my box in his\\nbeak), and then, all on a sudden, felt myself falling perpendicularly\\ndown, for above a minute, but with such incredible swiftness, that I\\nalmost lost my breath.  My fall was stopped by a terrible squash, that\\nsounded louder to my ears than the cataract of Niagara; after which, I\\nwas quite in the dark for another minute, and then my box began to rise\\nso high, that I could see light from the tops of the windows.  I now\\nperceived I was fallen into the sea.  My box, by the weight of my body,\\nthe goods that were in, and the broad plates of iron fixed for strength\\nat the four corners of the top and bottom, floated about five feet deep\\nin water.  I did then, and do now suppose, that the eagle which flew away\\nwith my box was pursued by two or three others, and forced to let me\\ndrop, while he defended himself against the rest, who hoped to share in\\nthe prey.  The plates of iron fastened at the bottom of the box (for\\nthose were the strongest) preserved the balance while it fell, and\\nhindered it from being broken on the surface of the water. Every joint of\\nit was well grooved; and the door did not move on hinges, but up and down\\nlike a sash, which kept my closet so tight that very little water came\\nin.  I got with much difficulty out of my hammock, having first ventured\\nto draw back the slip-board on the roof already mentioned, contrived on\\npurpose to let in air, for want of which I found myself almost stifled.\\n\\nHow often did I then wish myself with my dear Glumdalclitch, from whom\\none single hour had so far divided me!  And I may say with truth, that in\\nthe midst of my own misfortunes I could not forbear lamenting my poor\\nnurse, the grief she would suffer for my loss, the displeasure of the\\nqueen, and the ruin of her fortune.  Perhaps many travellers have not\\nbeen under greater difficulties and distress than I was at this juncture,\\nexpecting every moment to see my box dashed to pieces, or at least\\noverset by the first violent blast, or rising wave.  A breach in one\\nsingle pane of glass would have been immediate death: nor could any thing\\nhave preserved the windows, but the strong lattice wires placed on the\\noutside, against accidents in travelling.  I saw the water ooze in at\\nseveral crannies, although the leaks were not considerable, and I\\nendeavoured to stop them as well as I could.  I was not able to lift up\\nthe roof of my closet, which otherwise I certainly should have done, and\\nsat on the top of it; where I might at least preserve myself some hours\\nlonger, than by being shut up (as I may call it) in the hold.  Or if I\\nescaped these dangers for a day or two, what could I expect but a\\nmiserable death of cold and hunger?  I was four hours under these\\ncircumstances, expecting, and indeed wishing, every moment to be my last.\\n\\nI have already told the reader that there were two strong staples fixed\\nupon that side of my box which had no window, and into which the servant,\\nwho used to carry me on horseback, would put a leathern belt, and buckle\\nit about his waist.  Being in this disconsolate state, I heard, or at\\nleast thought I heard, some kind of grating noise on that side of my box\\nwhere the staples were fixed; and soon after I began to fancy that the\\nbox was pulled or towed along the sea; for I now and then felt a sort of\\ntugging, which made the waves rise near the tops of my windows, leaving\\nme almost in the dark.  This gave me some faint hopes of relief, although\\nI was not able to imagine how it could be brought about.  I ventured to\\nunscrew one of my chairs, which were always fastened to the floor; and\\nhaving made a hard shift to screw it down again, directly under the\\nslipping-board that I had lately opened, I mounted on the chair, and\\nputting my mouth as near as I could to the hole, I called for help in a\\nloud voice, and in all the languages I understood.  I then fastened my\\nhandkerchief to a stick I usually carried, and thrusting it up the hole,\\nwaved it several times in the air, that if any boat or ship were near,\\nthe seamen might conjecture some unhappy mortal to be shut up in the box.\\n\\nI found no effect from all I could do, but plainly perceived my closet to\\nbe moved along; and in the space of an hour, or better, that side of the\\nbox where the staples were, and had no windows, struck against something\\nthat was hard.  I apprehended it to be a rock, and found myself tossed\\nmore than ever.  I plainly heard a noise upon the cover of my closet,\\nlike that of a cable, and the grating of it as it passed through the\\nring.  I then found myself hoisted up, by degrees, at least three feet\\nhigher than I was before.  Whereupon I again thrust up my stick and\\nhandkerchief, calling for help till I was almost hoarse.  In return to\\nwhich, I heard a great shout repeated three times, giving me such\\ntransports of joy as are not to be conceived but by those who feel them.\\nI now heard a trampling over my head, and somebody calling through the\\nhole with a loud voice, in the English tongue, “If there be any body\\nbelow, let them speak.”  I answered, “I was an Englishman, drawn by ill\\nfortune into the greatest calamity that ever any creature underwent, and\\nbegged, by all that was moving, to be delivered out of the dungeon I was\\nin.”  The voice replied, “I was safe, for my box was fastened to their\\nship; and the carpenter should immediately come and saw a hole in the\\ncover, large enough to pull me out.”  I answered, “that was needless, and\\nwould take up too much time; for there was no more to be done, but let\\none of the crew put his finger into the ring, and take the box out of the\\nsea into the ship, and so into the captain’s cabin.”  Some of them, upon\\nhearing me talk so wildly, thought I was mad: others laughed; for indeed\\nit never came into my head, that I was now got among people of my own\\nstature and strength.  The carpenter came, and in a few minutes sawed a\\npassage about four feet square, then let down a small ladder, upon which\\nI mounted, and thence was taken into the ship in a very weak condition.\\n\\nThe sailors were all in amazement, and asked me a thousand questions,\\nwhich I had no inclination to answer.  I was equally confounded at the\\nsight of so many pigmies, for such I took them to be, after having so\\nlong accustomed mine eyes to the monstrous objects I had left.  But the\\ncaptain, Mr. Thomas Wilcocks, an honest worthy Shropshire man, observing\\nI was ready to faint, took me into his cabin, gave me a cordial to\\ncomfort me, and made me turn in upon his own bed, advising me to take a\\nlittle rest, of which I had great need.  Before I went to sleep, I gave\\nhim to understand that I had some valuable furniture in my box, too good\\nto be lost: a fine hammock, a handsome field-bed, two chairs, a table,\\nand a cabinet; that my closet was hung on all sides, or rather quilted,\\nwith silk and cotton; that if he would let one of the crew bring my\\ncloset into his cabin, I would open it there before him, and show him my\\ngoods.  The captain, hearing me utter these absurdities, concluded I was\\nraving; however (I suppose to pacify me) he promised to give order as I\\ndesired, and going upon deck, sent some of his men down into my closet,\\nwhence (as I afterwards found) they drew up all my goods, and stripped\\noff the quilting; but the chairs, cabinet, and bedstead, being screwed to\\nthe floor, were much damaged by the ignorance of the seamen, who tore\\nthem up by force.  Then they knocked off some of the boards for the use\\nof the ship, and when they had got all they had a mind for, let the hull\\ndrop into the sea, which by reason of many breaches made in the bottom\\nand sides, sunk to rights.  And, indeed, I was glad not to have been a\\nspectator of the havoc they made, because I am confident it would have\\nsensibly touched me, by bringing former passages into my mind, which I\\nwould rather have forgot.\\n\\nI slept some hours, but perpetually disturbed with dreams of the place I\\nhad left, and the dangers I had escaped.  However, upon waking, I found\\nmyself much recovered.  It was now about eight o’clock at night, and the\\ncaptain ordered supper immediately, thinking I had already fasted too\\nlong.  He entertained me with great kindness, observing me not to look\\nwildly, or talk inconsistently: and, when we were left alone, desired I\\nwould give him a relation of my travels, and by what accident I came to\\nbe set adrift, in that monstrous wooden chest.  He said “that about\\ntwelve o’clock at noon, as he was looking through his glass, he spied it\\nat a distance, and thought it was a sail, which he had a mind to make,\\nbeing not much out of his course, in hopes of buying some biscuit, his\\nown beginning to fall short.  That upon coming nearer, and finding his\\nerror, he sent out his long-boat to discover what it was; that his men\\ncame back in a fright, swearing they had seen a swimming house.  That he\\nlaughed at their folly, and went himself in the boat, ordering his men to\\ntake a strong cable along with them.  That the weather being calm, he\\nrowed round me several times, observed my windows and wire lattices that\\ndefended them.  That he discovered two staples upon one side, which was\\nall of boards, without any passage for light.  He then commanded his men\\nto row up to that side, and fastening a cable to one of the staples,\\nordered them to tow my chest, as they called it, toward the ship.  When\\nit was there, he gave directions to fasten another cable to the ring\\nfixed in the cover, and to raise up my chest with pulleys, which all the\\nsailors were not able to do above two or three feet.”  He said, “they saw\\nmy stick and handkerchief thrust out of the hole, and concluded that some\\nunhappy man must be shut up in the cavity.”  I asked, “whether he or the\\ncrew had seen any prodigious birds in the air, about the time he first\\ndiscovered me.”  To which he answered, “that discoursing this matter with\\nthe sailors while I was asleep, one of them said, he had observed three\\neagles flying towards the north, but remarked nothing of their being\\nlarger than the usual size:” which I suppose must be imputed to the great\\nheight they were at; and he could not guess the reason of my question.  I\\nthen asked the captain, “how far he reckoned we might be from land?”  He\\nsaid, “by the best computation he could make, we were at least a hundred\\nleagues.”  I assured him, “that he must be mistaken by almost half, for I\\nhad not left the country whence I came above two hours before I dropped\\ninto the sea.”  Whereupon he began again to think that my brain was\\ndisturbed, of which he gave me a hint, and advised me to go to bed in a\\ncabin he had provided.  I assured him, “I was well refreshed with his\\ngood entertainment and company, and as much in my senses as ever I was in\\nmy life.”  He then grew serious, and desired to ask me freely, “whether I\\nwere not troubled in my mind by the consciousness of some enormous crime,\\nfor which I was punished, at the command of some prince, by exposing me\\nin that chest; as great criminals, in other countries, have been forced\\nto sea in a leaky vessel, without provisions: for although he should be\\nsorry to have taken so ill a man into his ship, yet he would engage his\\nword to set me safe ashore, in the first port where we arrived.”  He\\nadded, “that his suspicions were much increased by some very absurd\\nspeeches I had delivered at first to his sailors, and afterwards to\\nhimself, in relation to my closet or chest, as well as by my odd looks\\nand behaviour while I was at supper.”\\n\\nI begged his patience to hear me tell my story, which I faithfully did,\\nfrom the last time I left England, to the moment he first discovered me.\\nAnd, as truth always forces its way into rational minds, so this honest\\nworthy gentleman, who had some tincture of learning, and very good sense,\\nwas immediately convinced of my candour and veracity.  But further to\\nconfirm all I had said, I entreated him to give order that my cabinet\\nshould be brought, of which I had the key in my pocket; for he had\\nalready informed me how the seamen disposed of my closet.  I opened it in\\nhis own presence, and showed him the small collection of rarities I made\\nin the country from which I had been so strangely delivered.  There was\\nthe comb I had contrived out of the stumps of the king’s beard, and\\nanother of the same materials, but fixed into a paring of her majesty’s\\nthumb-nail, which served for the back.  There was a collection of needles\\nand pins, from a foot to half a yard long; four wasp stings, like\\njoiner’s tacks; some combings of the queen’s hair; a gold ring, which one\\nday she made me a present of, in a most obliging manner, taking it from\\nher little finger, and throwing it over my head like a collar.  I desired\\nthe captain would please to accept this ring in return for his\\ncivilities; which he absolutely refused.  I showed him a corn that I had\\ncut off with my own hand, from a maid of honour’s toe; it was about the\\nbigness of Kentish pippin, and grown so hard, that when I returned\\nEngland, I got it hollowed into a cup, and set in silver.  Lastly, I\\ndesired him to see the breeches I had then on, which were made of a\\nmouse’s skin.\\n\\nI could force nothing on him but a footman’s tooth, which I observed him\\nto examine with great curiosity, and found he had a fancy for it.  He\\nreceived it with abundance of thanks, more than such a trifle could\\ndeserve.  It was drawn by an unskilful surgeon, in a mistake, from one of\\nGlumdalclitch’s men, who was afflicted with the tooth-ache, but it was as\\nsound as any in his head.  I got it cleaned, and put it into my cabinet.\\nIt was about a foot long, and four inches in diameter.\\n\\nThe captain was very well satisfied with this plain relation I had given\\nhim, and said, “he hoped, when we returned to England, I would oblige the\\nworld by putting it on paper, and making it public.”  My answer was,\\n“that we were overstocked with books of travels: that nothing could now\\npass which was not extraordinary; wherein I doubted some authors less\\nconsulted truth, than their own vanity, or interest, or the diversion of\\nignorant readers; that my story could contain little beside common\\nevents, without those ornamental descriptions of strange plants, trees,\\nbirds, and other animals; or of the barbarous customs and idolatry of\\nsavage people, with which most writers abound.  However, I thanked him\\nfor his good opinion, and promised to take the matter into my thoughts.”\\n\\nHe said “he wondered at one thing very much, which was, to hear me speak\\nso loud;” asking me “whether the king or queen of that country were thick\\nof hearing?”  I told him, “it was what I had been used to for above two\\nyears past, and that I admired as much at the voices of him and his men,\\nwho seemed to me only to whisper, and yet I could hear them well enough.\\nBut, when I spoke in that country, it was like a man talking in the\\nstreets, to another looking out from the top of a steeple, unless when I\\nwas placed on a table, or held in any person’s hand.”  I told him, “I had\\nlikewise observed another thing, that, when I first got into the ship,\\nand the sailors stood all about me, I thought they were the most little\\ncontemptible creatures I had ever beheld.”  For indeed, while I was in\\nthat prince’s country, I could never endure to look in a glass, after\\nmine eyes had been accustomed to such prodigious objects, because the\\ncomparison gave me so despicable a conceit of myself.  The captain said,\\n“that while we were at supper, he observed me to look at every thing with\\na sort of wonder, and that I often seemed hardly able to contain my\\nlaughter, which he knew not well how to take, but imputed it to some\\ndisorder in my brain.”  I answered, “it was very true; and I wondered how\\nI could forbear, when I saw his dishes of the size of a silver\\nthree-pence, a leg of pork hardly a mouthful, a cup not so big as a\\nnut-shell;” and so I went on, describing the rest of his household-stuff\\nand provisions, after the same manner.  For, although he queen had\\nordered a little equipage of all things necessary for me, while I was in\\nher service, yet my ideas were wholly taken up with what I saw on every\\nside of me, and I winked at my own littleness, as people do at their own\\nfaults.  The captain understood my raillery very well, and merrily\\nreplied with the old English proverb, “that he doubted mine eyes were\\nbigger than my belly, for he did not observe my stomach so good, although\\nI had fasted all day;” and, continuing in his mirth, protested “he would\\nhave gladly given a hundred pounds, to have seen my closet in the eagle’s\\nbill, and afterwards in its fall from so great a height into the sea;\\nwhich would certainly have been a most astonishing object, worthy to have\\nthe description of it transmitted to future ages:” and the comparison of\\nPhaëton was so obvious, that he could not forbear applying it, although I\\ndid not much admire the conceit.\\n\\nThe captain having been at Tonquin, was, in his return to England, driven\\nnorth-eastward to the latitude of 44 degrees, and longitude of 143.  But\\nmeeting a trade-wind two days after I came on board him, we sailed\\nsouthward a long time, and coasting New Holland, kept our course\\nwest-south-west, and then south-south-west, till we doubled the Cape of\\nGood Hope.  Our voyage was very prosperous, but I shall not trouble the\\nreader with a journal of it.  The captain called in at one or two ports,\\nand sent in his long-boat for provisions and fresh water; but I never\\nwent out of the ship till we came into the Downs, which was on the third\\nday of June, 1706, about nine months after my escape.  I offered to leave\\nmy goods in security for payment of my freight: but the captain protested\\nhe would not receive one farthing.  We took a kind leave of each other,\\nand I made him promise he would come to see me at my house in Redriff.  I\\nhired a horse and guide for five shillings, which I borrowed of the\\ncaptain.\\n\\nAs I was on the road, observing the littleness of the houses, the trees,\\nthe cattle, and the people, I began to think myself in Lilliput.  I was\\nafraid of trampling on every traveller I met, and often called aloud to\\nhave them stand out of the way, so that I had like to have gotten one or\\ntwo broken heads for my impertinence.\\n\\nWhen I came to my own house, for which I was forced to inquire, one of\\nthe servants opening the door, I bent down to go in, (like a goose under\\na gate,) for fear of striking my head.  My wife run out to embrace me,\\nbut I stooped lower than her knees, thinking she could otherwise never be\\nable to reach my mouth.  My daughter kneeled to ask my blessing, but I\\ncould not see her till she arose, having been so long used to stand with\\nmy head and eyes erect to above sixty feet; and then I went to take her\\nup with one hand by the waist.  I looked down upon the servants, and one\\nor two friends who were in the house, as if they had been pigmies and I a\\ngiant.  I told my wife, “she had been too thrifty, for I found she had\\nstarved herself and her daughter to nothing.”  In short, I behaved myself\\nso unaccountably, that they were all of the captain’s opinion when he\\nfirst saw me, and concluded I had lost my wits.  This I mention as an\\ninstance of the great power of habit and prejudice.\\n\\nIn a little time, I and my family and friends came to a right\\nunderstanding: but my wife protested “I should never go to sea any more;”\\nalthough my evil destiny so ordered, that she had not power to hinder me,\\nas the reader may know hereafter.  In the mean time, I here conclude the\\nsecond part of my unfortunate voyages.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART III.  A VOYAGE TO LAPUTA, BALNIBARBI, LUGGNAGG, GLUBBDUBDRIB, AND\\nJAPAN.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\n\\n\\nThe author sets out on his third voyage.  Is taken by pirates.  The\\nmalice of a Dutchman.  His arrival at an island.  He is received into\\nLaputa.\\n\\nI had not been at home above ten days, when Captain William Robinson, a\\nCornish man, commander of the Hopewell, a stout ship of three hundred\\ntons, came to my house.  I had formerly been surgeon of another ship\\nwhere he was master, and a fourth part owner, in a voyage to the Levant.\\nHe had always treated me more like a brother, than an inferior officer;\\nand, hearing of my arrival, made me a visit, as I apprehended only out of\\nfriendship, for nothing passed more than what is usual after long\\nabsences.  But repeating his visits often, expressing his joy to find I\\nme in good health, asking, “whether I were now settled for life?” adding,\\n“that he intended a voyage to the East Indies in two months,” at last he\\nplainly invited me, though with some apologies, to be surgeon of the\\nship; “that I should have another surgeon under me, beside our two mates;\\nthat my salary should be double to the usual pay; and that having\\nexperienced my knowledge in sea-affairs to be at least equal to his, he\\nwould enter into any engagement to follow my advice, as much as if I had\\nshared in the command.”\\n\\nHe said so many other obliging things, and I knew him to be so honest a\\nman, that I could not reject this proposal; the thirst I had of seeing\\nthe world, notwithstanding my past misfortunes, continuing as violent as\\never.  The only difficulty that remained, was to persuade my wife, whose\\nconsent however I at last obtained, by the prospect of advantage she\\nproposed to her children.\\n\\nWe set out the 5th day of August, 1706, and arrived at Fort St. George\\nthe 11th of April, 1707.  We staid there three weeks to refresh our crew,\\nmany of whom were sick.  From thence we went to Tonquin, where the\\ncaptain resolved to continue some time, because many of the goods he\\nintended to buy were not ready, nor could he expect to be dispatched in\\nseveral months.  Therefore, in hopes to defray some of the charges he\\nmust be at, he bought a sloop, loaded it with several sorts of goods,\\nwherewith the Tonquinese usually trade to the neighbouring islands, and\\nputting fourteen men on board, whereof three were of the country, he\\nappointed me master of the sloop, and gave me power to traffic, while he\\ntransacted his affairs at Tonquin.\\n\\nWe had not sailed above three days, when a great storm arising, we were\\ndriven five days to the north-north-east, and then to the east: after\\nwhich we had fair weather, but still with a pretty strong gale from the\\nwest.  Upon the tenth day we were chased by two pirates, who soon\\novertook us; for my sloop was so deep laden, that she sailed very slow,\\nneither were we in a condition to defend ourselves.\\n\\nWe were boarded about the same time by both the pirates, who entered\\nfuriously at the head of their men; but finding us all prostrate upon our\\nfaces (for so I gave order), they pinioned us with strong ropes, and\\nsetting guard upon us, went to search the sloop.\\n\\nI observed among them a Dutchman, who seemed to be of some authority,\\nthough he was not commander of either ship.  He knew us by our\\ncountenances to be Englishmen, and jabbering to us in his own language,\\nswore we should be tied back to back and thrown into the sea.  I spoken\\nDutch tolerably well; I told him who we were, and begged him, in\\nconsideration of our being Christians and Protestants, of neighbouring\\ncountries in strict alliance, that he would move the captains to take\\nsome pity on us.  This inflamed his rage; he repeated his threatenings,\\nand turning to his companions, spoke with great vehemence in the Japanese\\nlanguage, as I suppose, often using the word _Christianos_.\\n\\nThe largest of the two pirate ships was commanded by a Japanese captain,\\nwho spoke a little Dutch, but very imperfectly.  He came up to me, and\\nafter several questions, which I answered in great humility, he said, “we\\nshould not die.”  I made the captain a very low bow, and then, turning to\\nthe Dutchman, said, “I was sorry to find more mercy in a heathen, than in\\na brother christian.”  But I had soon reason to repent those foolish\\nwords: for that malicious reprobate, having often endeavoured in vain to\\npersuade both the captains that I might be thrown into the sea (which\\nthey would not yield to, after the promise made me that I should not\\ndie), however, prevailed so far, as to have a punishment inflicted on me,\\nworse, in all human appearance, than death itself.  My men were sent by\\nan equal division into both the pirate ships, and my sloop new manned.\\nAs to myself, it was determined that I should be set adrift in a small\\ncanoe, with paddles and a sail, and four days’ provisions; which last,\\nthe Japanese captain was so kind to double out of his own stores, and\\nwould permit no man to search me.  I got down into the canoe, while the\\nDutchman, standing upon the deck, loaded me with all the curses and\\ninjurious terms his language could afford.\\n\\nAbout an hour before we saw the pirates I had taken an observation, and\\nfound we were in the latitude of 46 N. and longitude of 183.  When I was\\nat some distance from the pirates, I discovered, by my pocket-glass,\\nseveral islands to the south-east.  I set up my sail, the wind being\\nfair, with a design to reach the nearest of those islands, which I made a\\nshift to do, in about three hours.  It was all rocky: however I got many\\nbirds’ eggs; and, striking fire, I kindled some heath and dry sea-weed,\\nby which I roasted my eggs.  I ate no other supper, being resolved to\\nspare my provisions as much as I could.  I passed the night under the\\nshelter of a rock, strewing some heath under me, and slept pretty well.\\n\\nThe next day I sailed to another island, and thence to a third and\\nfourth, sometimes using my sail, and sometimes my paddles.  But, not to\\ntrouble the reader with a particular account of my distresses, let it\\nsuffice, that on the fifth day I arrived at the last island in my sight,\\nwhich lay south-south-east to the former.\\n\\nThis island was at a greater distance than I expected, and I did not\\nreach it in less than five hours.  I encompassed it almost round, before\\nI could find a convenient place to land in; which was a small creek,\\nabout three times the wideness of my canoe.  I found the island to be all\\nrocky, only a little intermingled with tufts of grass, and sweet-smelling\\nherbs.  I took out my small provisions and after having refreshed myself,\\nI secured the remainder in a cave, whereof there were great numbers; I\\ngathered plenty of eggs upon the rocks, and got a quantity of dry\\nsea-weed, and parched grass, which I designed to kindle the next day, and\\nroast my eggs as well as I could, for I had about me my flint, steel,\\nmatch, and burning-glass.  I lay all night in the cave where I had lodged\\nmy provisions.  My bed was the same dry grass and sea-weed which I\\nintended for fuel.  I slept very little, for the disquiets of my mind\\nprevailed over my weariness, and kept me awake.  I considered how\\nimpossible it was to preserve my life in so desolate a place, and how\\nmiserable my end must be: yet found myself so listless and desponding,\\nthat I had not the heart to rise; and before I could get spirits enough\\nto creep out of my cave, the day was far advanced.  I walked awhile among\\nthe rocks: the sky was perfectly clear, and the sun so hot, that I was\\nforced to turn my face from it: when all on a sudden it became obscure,\\nas I thought, in a manner very different from what happens by the\\ninterposition of a cloud.  I turned back, and perceived a vast opaque\\nbody between me and the sun moving forwards towards the island: it seemed\\nto be about two miles high, and hid the sun six or seven minutes; but I\\ndid not observe the air to be much colder, or the sky more darkened, than\\nif I had stood under the shade of a mountain.  As it approached nearer\\nover the place where I was, it appeared to be a firm substance, the\\nbottom flat, smooth, and shining very bright, from the reflection of the\\nsea below.  I stood upon a height about two hundred yards from the shore,\\nand saw this vast body descending almost to a parallel with me, at less\\nthan an English mile distance.  I took out my pocket perspective, and\\ncould plainly discover numbers of people moving up and down the sides of\\nit, which appeared to be sloping; but what those people where doing I was\\nnot able to distinguish.\\n\\nThe natural love of life gave me some inward motion of joy, and I was\\nready to entertain a hope that this adventure might, some way or other,\\nhelp to deliver me from the desolate place and condition I was in.  But\\nat the same time the reader can hardly conceive my astonishment, to\\nbehold an island in the air, inhabited by men, who were able (as it\\nshould seem) to raise or sink, or put it into progressive motion, as they\\npleased.  But not being at that time in a disposition to philosophise\\nupon this phenomenon, I rather chose to observe what course the island\\nwould take, because it seemed for awhile to stand still.  Yet soon after,\\nit advanced nearer, and I could see the sides of it encompassed with\\nseveral gradations of galleries, and stairs, at certain intervals, to\\ndescend from one to the other.  In the lowest gallery, I beheld some\\npeople fishing with long angling rods, and others looking on.  I waved my\\ncap (for my hat was long since worn out) and my handkerchief toward the\\nisland; and upon its nearer approach, I called and shouted with the\\nutmost strength of my voice; and then looking circumspectly, I beheld a\\ncrowd gather to that side which was most in my view.  I found by their\\npointing towards me and to each other, that they plainly discovered me,\\nalthough they made no return to my shouting.  But I could see four or\\nfive men running in great haste, up the stairs, to the top of the island,\\nwho then disappeared.  I happened rightly to conjecture, that these were\\nsent for orders to some person in authority upon this occasion.\\n\\nThe number of people increased, and, in less than half all hour, the\\nisland was moved and raised in such a manner, that the lowest gallery\\nappeared in a parallel of less then a hundred yards distance from the\\nheight where I stood.  I then put myself in the most supplicating\\nposture, and spoke in the humblest accent, but received no answer.  Those\\nwho stood nearest over against me, seemed to be persons of distinction,\\nas I supposed by their habit.  They conferred earnestly with each other,\\nlooking often upon me.  At length one of them called out in a clear,\\npolite, smooth dialect, not unlike in sound to the Italian: and therefore\\nI returned an answer in that language, hoping at least that the cadence\\nmight be more agreeable to his ears.  Although neither of us understood\\nthe other, yet my meaning was easily known, for the people saw the\\ndistress I was in.\\n\\nThey made signs for me to come down from the rock, and go towards the\\nshore, which I accordingly did; and the flying island being raised to a\\nconvenient height, the verge directly over me, a chain was let down from\\nthe lowest gallery, with a seat fastened to the bottom, to which I fixed\\nmyself, and was drawn up by pulleys.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\n\\nThe humours and dispositions of the Laputians described.  An account of\\ntheir learning.  Of the king and his court.  The author’s reception\\nthere.  The inhabitants subject to fear and disquietudes.  An account of\\nthe women.\\n\\nAt my alighting, I was surrounded with a crowd of people, but those who\\nstood nearest seemed to be of better quality.  They beheld me with all\\nthe marks and circumstances of wonder; neither indeed was I much in their\\ndebt, having never till then seen a race of mortals so singular in their\\nshapes, habits, and countenances.  Their heads were all reclined, either\\nto the right, or the left; one of their eyes turned inward, and the other\\ndirectly up to the zenith.  Their outward garments were adorned with the\\nfigures of suns, moons, and stars; interwoven with those of fiddles,\\nflutes, harps, trumpets, guitars, harpsichords, and many other\\ninstruments of music, unknown to us in Europe.  I observed, here and\\nthere, many in the habit of servants, with a blown bladder, fastened like\\na flail to the end of a stick, which they carried in their hands.  In\\neach bladder was a small quantity of dried peas, or little pebbles, as I\\nwas afterwards informed.  With these bladders, they now and then flapped\\nthe mouths and ears of those who stood near them, of which practice I\\ncould not then conceive the meaning.  It seems the minds of these people\\nare so taken up with intense speculations, that they neither can speak,\\nnor attend to the discourses of others, without being roused by some\\nexternal taction upon the organs of speech and hearing; for which reason,\\nthose persons who are able to afford it always keep a flapper (the\\noriginal is _climenole_) in their family, as one of their domestics; nor\\never walk abroad, or make visits, without him.  And the business of this\\nofficer is, when two, three, or more persons are in company, gently to\\nstrike with his bladder the mouth of him who is to speak, and the right\\near of him or them to whom the speaker addresses himself.  This flapper\\nis likewise employed diligently to attend his master in his walks, and\\nupon occasion to give him a soft flap on his eyes; because he is always\\nso wrapped up in cogitation, that he is in manifest danger of falling\\ndown every precipice, and bouncing his head against every post; and in\\nthe streets, of justling others, or being justled himself into the\\nkennel.\\n\\nIt was necessary to give the reader this information, without which he\\nwould be at the same loss with me to understand the proceedings of these\\npeople, as they conducted me up the stairs to the top of the island, and\\nfrom thence to the royal palace.  While we were ascending, they forgot\\nseveral times what they were about, and left me to myself, till their\\nmemories were again roused by their flappers; for they appeared\\naltogether unmoved by the sight of my foreign habit and countenance, and\\nby the shouts of the vulgar, whose thoughts and minds were more\\ndisengaged.\\n\\nAt last we entered the palace, and proceeded into the chamber of\\npresence, where I saw the king seated on his throne, attended on each\\nside by persons of prime quality.  Before the throne, was a large table\\nfilled with globes and spheres, and mathematical instruments of all\\nkinds.  His majesty took not the least notice of us, although our\\nentrance was not without sufficient noise, by the concourse of all\\npersons belonging to the court.  But he was then deep in a problem; and\\nwe attended at least an hour, before he could solve it.  There stood by\\nhim, on each side, a young page with flaps in their hands, and when they\\nsaw he was at leisure, one of them gently struck his mouth, and the other\\nhis right ear; at which he startled like one awaked on the sudden, and\\nlooking towards me and the company I was in, recollected the occasion of\\nour coming, whereof he had been informed before.  He spoke some words,\\nwhereupon immediately a young man with a flap came up to my side, and\\nflapped me gently on the right ear; but I made signs, as well as I could,\\nthat I had no occasion for such an instrument; which, as I afterwards\\nfound, gave his majesty, and the whole court, a very mean opinion of my\\nunderstanding.  The king, as far as I could conjecture, asked me several\\nquestions, and I addressed myself to him in all the languages I had.\\nWhen it was found I could neither understand nor be understood, I was\\nconducted by his order to an apartment in his palace (this prince being\\ndistinguished above all his predecessors for his hospitality to\\nstrangers), where two servants were appointed to attend me.  My dinner\\nwas brought, and four persons of quality, whom I remembered to have seen\\nvery near the king’s person, did me the honour to dine with me.  We had\\ntwo courses, of three dishes each.  In the first course, there was a\\nshoulder of mutton cut into an equilateral triangle, a piece of beef into\\na rhomboides, and a pudding into a cycloid.  The second course was two\\nducks trussed up in the form of fiddles; sausages and puddings resembling\\nflutes and hautboys, and a breast of veal in the shape of a harp.  The\\nservants cut our bread into cones, cylinders, parallelograms, and several\\nother mathematical figures.\\n\\nWhile we were at dinner, I made bold to ask the names of several things\\nin their language, and those noble persons, by the assistance of their\\nflappers, delighted to give me answers, hoping to raise my admiration of\\ntheir great abilities if I could be brought to converse with them.  I was\\nsoon able to call for bread and drink, or whatever else I wanted.\\n\\nAfter dinner my company withdrew, and a person was sent to me by the\\nking’s order, attended by a flapper.  He brought with him pen, ink, and\\npaper, and three or four books, giving me to understand by signs, that he\\nwas sent to teach me the language.  We sat together four hours, in which\\ntime I wrote down a great number of words in columns, with the\\ntranslations over against them; I likewise made a shift to learn several\\nshort sentences; for my tutor would order one of my servants to fetch\\nsomething, to turn about, to make a bow, to sit, or to stand, or walk,\\nand the like.  Then I took down the sentence in writing.  He showed me\\nalso, in one of his books, the figures of the sun, moon, and stars, the\\nzodiac, the tropics, and polar circles, together with the denominations\\nof many plains and solids.  He gave me the names and descriptions of all\\nthe musical instruments, and the general terms of art in playing on each\\nof them.  After he had left me, I placed all my words, with their\\ninterpretations, in alphabetical order.  And thus, in a few days, by the\\nhelp of a very faithful memory, I got some insight into their language.\\nThe word, which I interpret the flying or floating island, is in the\\noriginal _Laputa_, whereof I could never learn the true etymology.\\n_Lap_, in the old obsolete language, signifies high; and _untuh_, a\\ngovernor; from which they say, by corruption, was derived _Laputa_, from\\n_Lapuntuh_.  But I do not approve of this derivation, which seems to be a\\nlittle strained.  I ventured to offer to the learned among them a\\nconjecture of my own, that Laputa was _quasi lap outed_; _lap_,\\nsignifying properly, the dancing of the sunbeams in the sea, and _outed_,\\na wing; which, however, I shall not obtrude, but submit to the judicious\\nreader.\\n\\nThose to whom the king had entrusted me, observing how ill I was clad,\\nordered a tailor to come next morning, and take measure for a suit of\\nclothes.  This operator did his office after a different manner from\\nthose of his trade in Europe.  He first took my altitude by a quadrant,\\nand then, with a rule and compasses, described the dimensions and\\noutlines of my whole body, all which he entered upon paper; and in six\\ndays brought my clothes very ill made, and quite out of shape, by\\nhappening to mistake a figure in the calculation.  But my comfort was,\\nthat I observed such accidents very frequent, and little regarded.\\n\\nDuring my confinement for want of clothes, and by an indisposition that\\nheld me some days longer, I much enlarged my dictionary; and when I went\\nnext to court, was able to understand many things the king spoke, and to\\nreturn him some kind of answers.  His majesty had given orders, that the\\nisland should move north-east and by east, to the vertical point over\\nLagado, the metropolis of the whole kingdom below, upon the firm earth.\\nIt was about ninety leagues distant, and our voyage lasted four days and\\na half.  I was not in the least sensible of the progressive motion made\\nin the air by the island.  On the second morning, about eleven o’clock,\\nthe king himself in person, attended by his nobility, courtiers, and\\nofficers, having prepared all their musical instruments, played on them\\nfor three hours without intermission, so that I was quite stunned with\\nthe noise; neither could I possibly guess the meaning, till my tutor\\ninformed me.  He said that, the people of their island had their ears\\nadapted to hear “the music of the spheres, which always played at certain\\nperiods, and the court was now prepared to bear their part, in whatever\\ninstrument they most excelled.”\\n\\nIn our journey towards Lagado, the capital city, his majesty ordered that\\nthe island should stop over certain towns and villages, from whence he\\nmight receive the petitions of his subjects.  And to this purpose,\\nseveral packthreads were let down, with small weights at the bottom.  On\\nthese packthreads the people strung their petitions, which mounted up\\ndirectly, like the scraps of paper fastened by school boys at the end of\\nthe string that holds their kite.  Sometimes we received wine and\\nvictuals from below, which were drawn up by pulleys.\\n\\nThe knowledge I had in mathematics, gave me great assistance in acquiring\\ntheir phraseology, which depended much upon that science, and music; and\\nin the latter I was not unskilled.  Their ideas are perpetually\\nconversant in lines and figures.  If they would, for example, praise the\\nbeauty of a woman, or any other animal, they describe it by rhombs,\\ncircles, parallelograms, ellipses, and other geometrical terms, or by\\nwords of art drawn from music, needless here to repeat.  I observed in\\nthe king’s kitchen all sorts of mathematical and musical instruments,\\nafter the figures of which they cut up the joints that were served to his\\nmajesty’s table.\\n\\nTheir houses are very ill built, the walls bevil, without one right angle\\nin any apartment; and this defect arises from the contempt they bear to\\npractical geometry, which they despise as vulgar and mechanic; those\\ninstructions they give being too refined for the intellects of their\\nworkmen, which occasions perpetual mistakes.  And although they are\\ndexterous enough upon a piece of paper, in the management of the rule,\\nthe pencil, and the divider, yet in the common actions and behaviour of\\nlife, I have not seen a more clumsy, awkward, and unhandy people, nor so\\nslow and perplexed in their conceptions upon all other subjects, except\\nthose of mathematics and music.  They are very bad reasoners, and\\nvehemently given to opposition, unless when they happen to be of the\\nright opinion, which is seldom their case.  Imagination, fancy, and\\ninvention, they are wholly strangers to, nor have any words in their\\nlanguage, by which those ideas can be expressed; the whole compass of\\ntheir thoughts and mind being shut up within the two forementioned\\nsciences.\\n\\nMost of them, and especially those who deal in the astronomical part,\\nhave great faith in judicial astrology, although they are ashamed to own\\nit publicly.  But what I chiefly admired, and thought altogether\\nunaccountable, was the strong disposition I observed in them towards news\\nand politics, perpetually inquiring into public affairs, giving their\\njudgments in matters of state, and passionately disputing every inch of a\\nparty opinion.  I have indeed observed the same disposition among most of\\nthe mathematicians I have known in Europe, although I could never\\ndiscover the least analogy between the two sciences; unless those people\\nsuppose, that because the smallest circle has as many degrees as the\\nlargest, therefore the regulation and management of the world require no\\nmore abilities than the handling and turning of a globe; but I rather\\ntake this quality to spring from a very common infirmity of human nature,\\ninclining us to be most curious and conceited in matters where we have\\nleast concern, and for which we are least adapted by study or nature.\\n\\nThese people are under continual disquietudes, never enjoying a minutes\\npeace of mind; and their disturbances proceed from causes which very\\nlittle affect the rest of mortals.  Their apprehensions arise from\\nseveral changes they dread in the celestial bodies: for instance, that\\nthe earth, by the continual approaches of the sun towards it, must, in\\ncourse of time, be absorbed, or swallowed up; that the face of the sun,\\nwill, by degrees, be encrusted with its own effluvia, and give no more\\nlight to the world; that the earth very narrowly escaped a brush from the\\ntail of the last comet, which would have infallibly reduced it to ashes;\\nand that the next, which they have calculated for one-and-thirty years\\nhence, will probably destroy us.  For if, in its perihelion, it should\\napproach within a certain degree of the sun (as by their calculations\\nthey have reason to dread) it will receive a degree of heat ten thousand\\ntimes more intense than that of red hot glowing iron, and in its absence\\nfrom the sun, carry a blazing tail ten hundred thousand and fourteen\\nmiles long, through which, if the earth should pass at the distance of\\none hundred thousand miles from the nucleus, or main body of the comet,\\nit must in its passage be set on fire, and reduced to ashes: that the\\nsun, daily spending its rays without any nutriment to supply them, will\\nat last be wholly consumed and annihilated; which must be attended with\\nthe destruction of this earth, and of all the planets that receive their\\nlight from it.\\n\\nThey are so perpetually alarmed with the apprehensions of these, and the\\nlike impending dangers, that they can neither sleep quietly in their\\nbeds, nor have any relish for the common pleasures and amusements of\\nlife.  When they meet an acquaintance in the morning, the first question\\nis about the sun’s health, how he looked at his setting and rising, and\\nwhat hopes they have to avoid the stroke of the approaching comet.  This\\nconversation they are apt to run into with the same temper that boys\\ndiscover in delighting to hear terrible stories of spirits and\\nhobgoblins, which they greedily listen to, and dare not go to bed for\\nfear.\\n\\nThe women of the island have abundance of vivacity: they, contemn their\\nhusbands, and are exceedingly fond of strangers, whereof there is always\\na considerable number from the continent below, attending at court,\\neither upon affairs of the several towns and corporations, or their own\\nparticular occasions, but are much despised, because they want the same\\nendowments.  Among these the ladies choose their gallants: but the\\nvexation is, that they act with too much ease and security; for the\\nhusband is always so rapt in speculation, that the mistress and lover may\\nproceed to the greatest familiarities before his face, if he be but\\nprovided with paper and implements, and without his flapper at his side.\\n\\nThe wives and daughters lament their confinement to the island, although\\nI think it the most delicious spot of ground in the world; and although\\nthey live here in the greatest plenty and magnificence, and are allowed\\nto do whatever they please, they long to see the world, and take the\\ndiversions of the metropolis, which they are not allowed to do without a\\nparticular license from the king; and this is not easy to be obtained,\\nbecause the people of quality have found, by frequent experience, how\\nhard it is to persuade their women to return from below.  I was told that\\na great court lady, who had several children,—is married to the prime\\nminister, the richest subject in the kingdom, a very graceful person,\\nextremely fond of her, and lives in the finest palace of the island,—went\\ndown to Lagado on the pretence of health, there hid herself for several\\nmonths, till the king sent a warrant to search for her; and she was found\\nin an obscure eating-house all in rags, having pawned her clothes to\\nmaintain an old deformed footman, who beat her every day, and in whose\\ncompany she was taken, much against her will.  And although her husband\\nreceived her with all possible kindness, and without the least reproach,\\nshe soon after contrived to steal down again, with all her jewels, to the\\nsame gallant, and has not been heard of since.\\n\\nThis may perhaps pass with the reader rather for an European or English\\nstory, than for one of a country so remote.  But he may please to\\nconsider, that the caprices of womankind are not limited by any climate\\nor nation, and that they are much more uniform, than can be easily\\nimagined.\\n\\nIn about a month’s time, I had made a tolerable proficiency in their\\nlanguage, and was able to answer most of the king’s questions, when I had\\nthe honour to attend him.  His majesty discovered not the least curiosity\\nto inquire into the laws, government, history, religion, or manners of\\nthe countries where I had been; but confined his questions to the state\\nof mathematics, and received the account I gave him with great contempt\\nand indifference, though often roused by his flapper on each side.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\n\\nA phenomenon solved by modern philosophy and astronomy.  The Laputians’\\ngreat improvements in the latter.  The king’s method of suppressing\\ninsurrections.\\n\\nI desired leave of this prince to see the curiosities of the island,\\nwhich he was graciously pleased to grant, and ordered my tutor to attend\\nme.  I chiefly wanted to know, to what cause, in art or in nature, it\\nowed its several motions, whereof I will now give a philosophical account\\nto the reader.\\n\\nThe flying or floating island is exactly circular, its diameter 7837\\nyards, or about four miles and a half, and consequently contains ten\\nthousand acres.  It is three hundred yards thick.  The bottom, or under\\nsurface, which appears to those who view it below, is one even regular\\nplate of adamant, shooting up to the height of about two hundred yards.\\nAbove it lie the several minerals in their usual order, and over all is a\\ncoat of rich mould, ten or twelve feet deep.  The declivity of the upper\\nsurface, from the circumference to the centre, is the natural cause why\\nall the dews and rains, which fall upon the island, are conveyed in small\\nrivulets toward the middle, where they are emptied into four large\\nbasins, each of about half a mile in circuit, and two hundred yards\\ndistant from the centre.  From these basins the water is continually\\nexhaled by the sun in the daytime, which effectually prevents their\\noverflowing.  Besides, as it is in the power of the monarch to raise the\\nisland above the region of clouds and vapours, he can prevent the falling\\nof dews and rain whenever he pleases.  For the highest clouds cannot rise\\nabove two miles, as naturalists agree, at least they were never known to\\ndo so in that country.\\n\\nAt the centre of the island there is a chasm about fifty yards in\\ndiameter, whence the astronomers descend into a large dome, which is\\ntherefore called _flandona gagnole_, or the astronomer’s cave, situated\\nat the depth of a hundred yards beneath the upper surface of the adamant.\\nIn this cave are twenty lamps continually burning, which, from the\\nreflection of the adamant, cast a strong light into every part.  The\\nplace is stored with great variety of sextants, quadrants, telescopes,\\nastrolabes, and other astronomical instruments.  But the greatest\\ncuriosity, upon which the fate of the island depends, is a loadstone of a\\nprodigious size, in shape resembling a weaver’s shuttle.  It is in length\\nsix yards, and in the thickest part at least three yards over.  This\\nmagnet is sustained by a very strong axle of adamant passing through its\\nmiddle, upon which it plays, and is poised so exactly that the weakest\\nhand can turn it.  It is hooped round with a hollow cylinder of adamant,\\nfour feet yards in diameter, placed horizontally, and supported by eight\\nadamantine feet, each six yards high.  In the middle of the concave side,\\nthere is a groove twelve inches deep, in which the extremities of the\\naxle are lodged, and turned round as there is occasion.\\n\\nThe stone cannot be removed from its place by any force, because the hoop\\nand its feet are one continued piece with that body of adamant which\\nconstitutes the bottom of the island.\\n\\nBy means of this loadstone, the island is made to rise and fall, and move\\nfrom one place to another.  For, with respect to that part of the earth\\nover which the monarch presides, the stone is endued at one of its sides\\nwith an attractive power, and at the other with a repulsive.  Upon\\nplacing the magnet erect, with its attracting end towards the earth, the\\nisland descends; but when the repelling extremity points downwards, the\\nisland mounts directly upwards.  When the position of the stone is\\noblique, the motion of the island is so too: for in this magnet, the\\nforces always act in lines parallel to its direction.\\n\\nBy this oblique motion, the island is conveyed to different parts of the\\nmonarch’s dominions.  To explain the manner of its progress, let _A_ _B_\\nrepresent a line drawn across the dominions of Balnibarbi, let the line\\n_c_ _d_ represent the loadstone, of which let _d_ be the repelling end,\\nand _c_ the attracting end, the island being over _C_: let the stone be\\nplaced in position _c_ _d_, with its repelling end downwards; then the\\nisland will be driven upwards obliquely towards _D_.  When it is arrived\\nat _D_, let the stone be turned upon its axle, till its attracting end\\npoints towards _E_, and then the island will be carried obliquely towards\\n_E_; where, if the stone be again turned upon its axle till it stands in\\nthe position _E_ _F_, with its repelling point downwards, the island will\\nrise obliquely towards _F_, where, by directing the attracting end\\ntowards _G_, the island may be carried to _G_, and from _G_ to _H_, by\\nturning the stone, so as to make its repelling extremity to point\\ndirectly downward.  And thus, by changing the situation of the stone, as\\noften as there is occasion, the island is made to rise and fall by turns\\nin an oblique direction, and by those alternate risings and fallings (the\\nobliquity being not considerable) is conveyed from one part of the\\ndominions to the other.\\n\\nBut it must be observed, that this island cannot move beyond the extent\\nof the dominions below, nor can it rise above the height of four miles.\\nFor which the astronomers (who have written large systems concerning the\\nstone) assign the following reason: that the magnetic virtue does not\\nextend beyond the distance of four miles, and that the mineral, which\\nacts upon the stone in the bowels of the earth, and in the sea about six\\nleagues distant from the shore, is not diffused through the whole globe,\\nbut terminated with the limits of the king’s dominions; and it was easy,\\nfrom the great advantage of such a superior situation, for a prince to\\nbring under his obedience whatever country lay within the attraction of\\nthat magnet.\\n\\nWhen the stone is put parallel to the plane of the horizon, the island\\nstands still; for in that case the extremities of it, being at equal\\ndistance from the earth, act with equal force, the one in drawing\\ndownwards, the other in pushing upwards, and consequently no motion can\\nensue.\\n\\nThis loadstone is under the care of certain astronomers, who, from time\\nto time, give it such positions as the monarch directs.  They spend the\\ngreatest part of their lives in observing the celestial bodies, which\\nthey do by the assistance of glasses, far excelling ours in goodness.\\nFor, although their largest telescopes do not exceed three feet, they\\nmagnify much more than those of a hundred with us, and show the stars\\nwith greater clearness.  This advantage has enabled them to extend their\\ndiscoveries much further than our astronomers in Europe; for they have\\nmade a catalogue of ten thousand fixed stars, whereas the largest of ours\\ndo not contain above one third part of that number.  They have likewise\\ndiscovered two lesser stars, or satellites, which revolve about Mars;\\nwhereof the innermost is distant from the centre of the primary planet\\nexactly three of his diameters, and the outermost, five; the former\\nrevolves in the space of ten hours, and the latter in twenty-one and a\\nhalf; so that the squares of their periodical times are very near in the\\nsame proportion with the cubes of their distance from the centre of Mars;\\nwhich evidently shows them to be governed by the same law of gravitation\\nthat influences the other heavenly bodies.\\n\\nThey have observed ninety-three different comets, and settled their\\nperiods with great exactness.  If this be true (and they affirm it with\\ngreat confidence) it is much to be wished, that their observations were\\nmade public, whereby the theory of comets, which at present is very lame\\nand defective, might be brought to the same perfection with other arts of\\nastronomy.\\n\\nThe king would be the most absolute prince in the universe, if he could\\nbut prevail on a ministry to join with him; but these having their\\nestates below on the continent, and considering that the office of a\\nfavourite has a very uncertain tenure, would never consent to the\\nenslaving of their country.\\n\\nIf any town should engage in rebellion or mutiny, fall into violent\\nfactions, or refuse to pay the usual tribute, the king has two methods of\\nreducing them to obedience.  The first and the mildest course is, by\\nkeeping the island hovering over such a town, and the lands about it,\\nwhereby he can deprive them of the benefit of the sun and the rain, and\\nconsequently afflict the inhabitants with dearth and diseases: and if the\\ncrime deserve it, they are at the same time pelted from above with great\\nstones, against which they have no defence but by creeping into cellars\\nor caves, while the roofs of their houses are beaten to pieces.  But if\\nthey still continue obstinate, or offer to raise insurrections, he\\nproceeds to the last remedy, by letting the island drop directly upon\\ntheir heads, which makes a universal destruction both of houses and men.\\nHowever, this is an extremity to which the prince is seldom driven,\\nneither indeed is he willing to put it in execution; nor dare his\\nministers advise him to an action, which, as it would render them odious\\nto the people, so it would be a great damage to their own estates, which\\nall lie below; for the island is the king’s demesne.\\n\\nBut there is still indeed a more weighty reason, why the kings of this\\ncountry have been always averse from executing so terrible an action,\\nunless upon the utmost necessity.  For, if the town intended to be\\ndestroyed should have in it any tall rocks, as it generally falls out in\\nthe larger cities, a situation probably chosen at first with a view to\\nprevent such a catastrophe; or if it abound in high spires, or pillars of\\nstone, a sudden fall might endanger the bottom or under surface of the\\nisland, which, although it consist, as I have said, of one entire\\nadamant, two hundred yards thick, might happen to crack by too great a\\nshock, or burst by approaching too near the fires from the houses below,\\nas the backs, both of iron and stone, will often do in our chimneys.  Of\\nall this the people are well apprised, and understand how far to carry\\ntheir obstinacy, where their liberty or property is concerned.  And the\\nking, when he is highest provoked, and most determined to press a city to\\nrubbish, orders the island to descend with great gentleness, out of a\\npretence of tenderness to his people, but, indeed, for fear of breaking\\nthe adamantine bottom; in which case, it is the opinion of all their\\nphilosophers, that the loadstone could no longer hold it up, and the\\nwhole mass would fall to the ground.\\n\\nBy a fundamental law of this realm, neither the king, nor either of his\\ntwo eldest sons, are permitted to leave the island; nor the queen, till\\nshe is past child-bearing.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\n\\nThe author leaves Laputa; is conveyed to Balnibarbi; arrives at the\\nmetropolis.  A description of the metropolis, and the country adjoining.\\nThe author hospitably received by a great lord.  His conversation with\\nthat lord.\\n\\nAlthough I cannot say that I was ill treated in this island, yet I must\\nconfess I thought myself too much neglected, not without some degree of\\ncontempt; for neither prince nor people appeared to be curious in any\\npart of knowledge, except mathematics and music, wherein I was far their\\ninferior, and upon that account very little regarded.\\n\\nOn the other side, after having seen all the curiosities of the island, I\\nwas very desirous to leave it, being heartily weary of those people.\\nThey were indeed excellent in two sciences for which I have great esteem,\\nand wherein I am not unversed; but, at the same time, so abstracted and\\ninvolved in speculation, that I never met with such disagreeable\\ncompanions.  I conversed only with women, tradesmen, flappers, and\\ncourt-pages, during two months of my abode there; by which, at last, I\\nrendered myself extremely contemptible; yet these were the only people\\nfrom whom I could ever receive a reasonable answer.\\n\\nI had obtained, by hard study, a good degree of knowledge in their\\nlanguage: I was weary of being confined to an island where I received so\\nlittle countenance, and resolved to leave it with the first opportunity.\\n\\nThere was a great lord at court, nearly related to the king, and for that\\nreason alone used with respect.  He was universally reckoned the most\\nignorant and stupid person among them.  He had performed many eminent\\nservices for the crown, had great natural and acquired parts, adorned\\nwith integrity and honour; but so ill an ear for music, that his\\ndetractors reported, “he had been often known to beat time in the wrong\\nplace;” neither could his tutors, without extreme difficulty, teach him\\nto demonstrate the most easy proposition in the mathematics.  He was\\npleased to show me many marks of favour, often did me the honour of a\\nvisit, desired to be informed in the affairs of Europe, the laws and\\ncustoms, the manners and learning of the several countries where I had\\ntravelled.  He listened to me with great attention, and made very wise\\nobservations on all I spoke.  He had two flappers attending him for\\nstate, but never made use of them, except at court and in visits of\\nceremony, and would always command them to withdraw, when we were alone\\ntogether.\\n\\nI entreated this illustrious person, to intercede in my behalf with his\\nmajesty, for leave to depart; which he accordingly did, as he was pleased\\nto tell me, with regret: for indeed he had made me several offers very\\nadvantageous, which, however, I refused, with expressions of the highest\\nacknowledgment.\\n\\nOn the 16th of February I took leave of his majesty and the court.  The\\nking made me a present to the value of about two hundred pounds English,\\nand my protector, his kinsman, as much more, together with a letter of\\nrecommendation to a friend of his in Lagado, the metropolis.  The island\\nbeing then hovering over a mountain about two miles from it, I was let\\ndown from the lowest gallery, in the same manner as I had been taken up.\\n\\nThe continent, as far as it is subject to the monarch of the flying\\nisland, passes under the general name of _Balnibarbi_; and the\\nmetropolis, as I said before, is called _Lagado_.  I felt some little\\nsatisfaction in finding myself on firm ground.  I walked to the city\\nwithout any concern, being clad like one of the natives, and sufficiently\\ninstructed to converse with them.  I soon found out the person’s house to\\nwhom I was recommended, presented my letter from his friend the grandee\\nin the island, and was received with much kindness.  This great lord,\\nwhose name was Munodi, ordered me an apartment in his own house, where I\\ncontinued during my stay, and was entertained in a most hospitable\\nmanner.\\n\\nThe next morning after my arrival, he took me in his chariot to see the\\ntown, which is about half the bigness of London; but the houses very\\nstrangely built, and most of them out of repair.  The people in the\\nstreets walked fast, looked wild, their eyes fixed, and were generally in\\nrags.  We passed through one of the town gates, and went about three\\nmiles into the country, where I saw many labourers working with several\\nsorts of tools in the ground, but was not able to conjecture what they\\nwere about: neither did observe any expectation either of corn or grass,\\nalthough the soil appeared to be excellent.  I could not forbear admiring\\nat these odd appearances, both in town and country; and I made bold to\\ndesire my conductor, that he would be pleased to explain to me, what\\ncould be meant by so many busy heads, hands, and faces, both in the\\nstreets and the fields, because I did not discover any good effects they\\nproduced; but, on the contrary, I never knew a soil so unhappily\\ncultivated, houses so ill contrived and so ruinous, or a people whose\\ncountenances and habit expressed so much misery and want.\\n\\nThis lord Munodi was a person of the first rank, and had been some years\\ngovernor of Lagado; but, by a cabal of ministers, was discharged for\\ninsufficiency.  However, the king treated him with tenderness, as a\\nwell-meaning man, but of a low contemptible understanding.\\n\\nWhen I gave that free censure of the country and its inhabitants, he made\\nno further answer than by telling me, “that I had not been long enough\\namong them to form a judgment; and that the different nations of the\\nworld had different customs;” with other common topics to the same\\npurpose.  But, when we returned to his palace, he asked me “how I liked\\nthe building, what absurdities I observed, and what quarrel I had with\\nthe dress or looks of his domestics?”  This he might safely do; because\\nevery thing about him was magnificent, regular, and polite.  I answered,\\n“that his excellency’s prudence, quality, and fortune, had exempted him\\nfrom those defects, which folly and beggary had produced in others.”  He\\nsaid, “if I would go with him to his country-house, about twenty miles\\ndistant, where his estate lay, there would be more leisure for this kind\\nof conversation.”  I told his excellency “that I was entirely at his\\ndisposal;” and accordingly we set out next morning.\\n\\nDuring our journey he made me observe the several methods used by farmers\\nin managing their lands, which to me were wholly unaccountable; for,\\nexcept in some very few places, I could not discover one ear of corn or\\nblade of grass.  But, in three hours travelling, the scene was wholly\\naltered; we came into a most beautiful country; farmers’ houses, at small\\ndistances, neatly built; the fields enclosed, containing vineyards,\\ncorn-grounds, and meadows.  Neither do I remember to have seen a more\\ndelightful prospect.  His excellency observed my countenance to clear up;\\nhe told me, with a sigh, “that there his estate began, and would continue\\nthe same, till we should come to his house: that his countrymen ridiculed\\nand despised him, for managing his affairs no better, and for setting so\\nill an example to the kingdom; which, however, was followed by very few,\\nsuch as were old, and wilful, and weak like himself.”\\n\\nWe came at length to the house, which was indeed a noble structure, built\\naccording to the best rules of ancient architecture.  The fountains,\\ngardens, walks, avenues, and groves, were all disposed with exact\\njudgment and taste.  I gave due praises to every thing I saw, whereof his\\nexcellency took not the least notice till after supper; when, there being\\nno third companion, he told me with a very melancholy air “that he\\ndoubted he must throw down his houses in town and country, to rebuild\\nthem after the present mode; destroy all his plantations, and cast others\\ninto such a form as modern usage required, and give the same directions\\nto all his tenants, unless he would submit to incur the censure of pride,\\nsingularity, affectation, ignorance, caprice, and perhaps increase his\\nmajesty’s displeasure; that the admiration I appeared to be under would\\ncease or diminish, when he had informed me of some particulars which,\\nprobably, I never heard of at court, the people there being too much\\ntaken up in their own speculations, to have regard to what passed here\\nbelow.”\\n\\nThe sum of his discourse was to this effect: “That about forty years ago,\\ncertain persons went up to Laputa, either upon business or diversion,\\nand, after five months continuance, came back with a very little\\nsmattering in mathematics, but full of volatile spirits acquired in that\\nairy region: that these persons, upon their return, began to dislike the\\nmanagement of every thing below, and fell into schemes of putting all\\narts, sciences, languages, and mechanics, upon a new foot.  To this end,\\nthey procured a royal patent for erecting an academy of projectors in\\nLagado; and the humour prevailed so strongly among the people, that there\\nis not a town of any consequence in the kingdom without such an academy.\\nIn these colleges the professors contrive new rules and methods of\\nagriculture and building, and new instruments, and tools for all trades\\nand manufactures; whereby, as they undertake, one man shall do the work\\nof ten; a palace may be built in a week, of materials so durable as to\\nlast for ever without repairing.  All the fruits of the earth shall come\\nto maturity at whatever season we think fit to choose, and increase a\\nhundred fold more than they do at present; with innumerable other happy\\nproposals.  The only inconvenience is, that none of these projects are\\nyet brought to perfection; and in the mean time, the whole country lies\\nmiserably waste, the houses in ruins, and the people without food or\\nclothes.  By all which, instead of being discouraged, they are fifty\\ntimes more violently bent upon prosecuting their schemes, driven equally\\non by hope and despair: that as for himself, being not of an enterprising\\nspirit, he was content to go on in the old forms, to live in the houses\\nhis ancestors had built, and act as they did, in every part of life,\\nwithout innovation: that some few other persons of quality and gentry had\\ndone the same, but were looked on with an eye of contempt and ill-will,\\nas enemies to art, ignorant, and ill common-wealth’s men, preferring\\ntheir own ease and sloth before the general improvement of their\\ncountry.”\\n\\nHis lordship added, “That he would not, by any further particulars,\\nprevent the pleasure I should certainly take in viewing the grand\\nacademy, whither he was resolved I should go.”  He only desired me to\\nobserve a ruined building, upon the side of a mountain about three miles\\ndistant, of which he gave me this account: “That he had a very convenient\\nmill within half a mile of his house, turned by a current from a large\\nriver, and sufficient for his own family, as well as a great number of\\nhis tenants; that about seven years ago, a club of those projectors came\\nto him with proposals to destroy this mill, and build another on the side\\nof that mountain, on the long ridge whereof a long canal must be cut, for\\na repository of water, to be conveyed up by pipes and engines to supply\\nthe mill, because the wind and air upon a height agitated the water, and\\nthereby made it fitter for motion, and because the water, descending down\\na declivity, would turn the mill with half the current of a river whose\\ncourse is more upon a level.”  He said, “that being then not very well\\nwith the court, and pressed by many of his friends, he complied with the\\nproposal; and after employing a hundred men for two years, the work\\nmiscarried, the projectors went off, laying the blame entirely upon him,\\nrailing at him ever since, and putting others upon the same experiment,\\nwith equal assurance of success, as well as equal disappointment.”\\n\\nIn a few days we came back to town; and his excellency, considering the\\nbad character he had in the academy, would not go with me himself, but\\nrecommended me to a friend of his, to bear me company thither.  My lord\\nwas pleased to represent me as a great admirer of projects, and a person\\nof much curiosity and easy belief; which, indeed, was not without truth;\\nfor I had myself been a sort of projector in my younger days.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\n\\nThe author permitted to see the grand academy of Lagado.  The academy\\nlargely described.  The arts wherein the professors employ themselves.\\n\\nThis academy is not an entire single building, but a continuation of\\nseveral houses on both sides of a street, which growing waste, was\\npurchased and applied to that use.\\n\\nI was received very kindly by the warden, and went for many days to the\\nacademy.  Every room has in it one or more projectors; and I believe I\\ncould not be in fewer than five hundred rooms.\\n\\nThe first man I saw was of a meagre aspect, with sooty hands and face,\\nhis hair and beard long, ragged, and singed in several places.  His\\nclothes, shirt, and skin, were all of the same colour.  He has been eight\\nyears upon a project for extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers, which were\\nto be put in phials hermetically sealed, and let out to warm the air in\\nraw inclement summers.  He told me, he did not doubt, that, in eight\\nyears more, he should be able to supply the governor’s gardens with\\nsunshine, at a reasonable rate: but he complained that his stock was low,\\nand entreated me “to give him something as an encouragement to ingenuity,\\nespecially since this had been a very dear season for cucumbers.”  I made\\nhim a small present, for my lord had furnished me with money on purpose,\\nbecause he knew their practice of begging from all who go to see them.\\n\\nI went into another chamber, but was ready to hasten back, being almost\\novercome with a horrible stink.  My conductor pressed me forward,\\nconjuring me in a whisper “to give no offence, which would be highly\\nresented;” and therefore I durst not so much as stop my nose.  The\\nprojector of this cell was the most ancient student of the academy; his\\nface and beard were of a pale yellow; his hands and clothes daubed over\\nwith filth.  When I was presented to him, he gave me a close embrace, a\\ncompliment I could well have excused.  His employment, from his first\\ncoming into the academy, was an operation to reduce human excrement to\\nits original food, by separating the several parts, removing the tincture\\nwhich it receives from the gall, making the odour exhale, and scumming\\noff the saliva.  He had a weekly allowance, from the society, of a vessel\\nfilled with human ordure, about the bigness of a Bristol barrel.\\n\\nI saw another at work to calcine ice into gunpowder; who likewise showed\\nme a treatise he had written concerning the malleability of fire, which\\nhe intended to publish.\\n\\nThere was a most ingenious architect, who had contrived a new method for\\nbuilding houses, by beginning at the roof, and working downward to the\\nfoundation; which he justified to me, by the like practice of those two\\nprudent insects, the bee and the spider.\\n\\nThere was a man born blind, who had several apprentices in his own\\ncondition: their employment was to mix colours for painters, which their\\nmaster taught them to distinguish by feeling and smelling.  It was indeed\\nmy misfortune to find them at that time not very perfect in their\\nlessons, and the professor himself happened to be generally mistaken.\\nThis artist is much encouraged and esteemed by the whole fraternity.\\n\\nIn another apartment I was highly pleased with a projector who had found\\na device of ploughing the ground with hogs, to save the charges of\\nploughs, cattle, and labour.  The method is this: in an acre of ground\\nyou bury, at six inches distance and eight deep, a quantity of acorns,\\ndates, chestnuts, and other mast or vegetables, whereof these animals are\\nfondest; then you drive six hundred or more of them into the field,\\nwhere, in a few days, they will root up the whole ground in search of\\ntheir food, and make it fit for sowing, at the same time manuring it with\\ntheir dung: it is true, upon experiment, they found the charge and\\ntrouble very great, and they had little or no crop.  However it is not\\ndoubted, that this invention may be capable of great improvement.\\n\\nI went into another room, where the walls and ceiling were all hung round\\nwith cobwebs, except a narrow passage for the artist to go in and out.\\nAt my entrance, he called aloud to me, “not to disturb his webs.”  He\\nlamented “the fatal mistake the world had been so long in, of using\\nsilkworms, while we had such plenty of domestic insects who infinitely\\nexcelled the former, because they understood how to weave, as well as\\nspin.”  And he proposed further, “that by employing spiders, the charge\\nof dyeing silks should be wholly saved;” whereof I was fully convinced,\\nwhen he showed me a vast number of flies most beautifully coloured,\\nwherewith he fed his spiders, assuring us “that the webs would take a\\ntincture from them; and as he had them of all hues, he hoped to fit\\neverybody’s fancy, as soon as he could find proper food for the flies, of\\ncertain gums, oils, and other glutinous matter, to give a strength and\\nconsistence to the threads.”\\n\\nThere was an astronomer, who had undertaken to place a sun-dial upon the\\ngreat weathercock on the town-house, by adjusting the annual and diurnal\\nmotions of the earth and sun, so as to answer and coincide with all\\naccidental turnings of the wind.\\n\\nI was complaining of a small fit of the colic, upon which my conductor\\nled me into a room where a great physician resided, who was famous for\\ncuring that disease, by contrary operations from the same instrument.  He\\nhad a large pair of bellows, with a long slender muzzle of ivory: this he\\nconveyed eight inches up the anus, and drawing in the wind, he affirmed\\nhe could make the guts as lank as a dried bladder.  But when the disease\\nwas more stubborn and violent, he let in the muzzle while the bellows\\nwere full of wind, which he discharged into the body of the patient; then\\nwithdrew the instrument to replenish it, clapping his thumb strongly\\nagainst the orifice of then fundament; and this being repeated three or\\nfour times, the adventitious wind would rush out, bringing the noxious\\nalong with it, (like water put into a pump), and the patient recovered.\\nI saw him try both experiments upon a dog, but could not discern any\\neffect from the former.  After the latter the animal was ready to burst,\\nand made so violent a discharge as was very offensive to me and my\\ncompanion.  The dog died on the spot, and we left the doctor endeavouring\\nto recover him, by the same operation.\\n\\nI visited many other apartments, but shall not trouble my reader with all\\nthe curiosities I observed, being studious of brevity.\\n\\nI had hitherto seen only one side of the academy, the other being\\nappropriated to the advancers of speculative learning, of whom I shall\\nsay something, when I have mentioned one illustrious person more, who is\\ncalled among them “the universal artist.”  He told us “he had been thirty\\nyears employing his thoughts for the improvement of human life.”  He had\\ntwo large rooms full of wonderful curiosities, and fifty men at work.\\nSome were condensing air into a dry tangible substance, by extracting the\\nnitre, and letting the aqueous or fluid particles percolate; others\\nsoftening marble, for pillows and pin-cushions; others petrifying the\\nhoofs of a living horse, to preserve them from foundering.  The artist\\nhimself was at that time busy upon two great designs; the first, to sow\\nland with chaff, wherein he affirmed the true seminal virtue to be\\ncontained, as he demonstrated by several experiments, which I was not\\nskilful enough to comprehend.  The other was, by a certain composition of\\ngums, minerals, and vegetables, outwardly applied, to prevent the growth\\nof wool upon two young lambs; and he hoped, in a reasonable time to\\npropagate the breed of naked sheep, all over the kingdom.\\n\\nWe crossed a walk to the other part of the academy, where, as I have\\nalready said, the projectors in speculative learning resided.\\n\\nThe first professor I saw, was in a very large room, with forty pupils\\nabout him.  After salutation, observing me to look earnestly upon a\\nframe, which took up the greatest part of both the length and breadth of\\nthe room, he said, “Perhaps I might wonder to see him employed in a\\nproject for improving speculative knowledge, by practical and mechanical\\noperations.  But the world would soon be sensible of its usefulness; and\\nhe flattered himself, that a more noble, exalted thought never sprang in\\nany other man’s head.  Every one knew how laborious the usual method is\\nof attaining to arts and sciences; whereas, by his contrivance, the most\\nignorant person, at a reasonable charge, and with a little bodily labour,\\nmight write books in philosophy, poetry, politics, laws, mathematics, and\\ntheology, without the least assistance from genius or study.”  He then\\nled me to the frame, about the sides, whereof all his pupils stood in\\nranks.  It was twenty feet square, placed in the middle of the room.  The\\nsuperfices was composed of several bits of wood, about the bigness of a\\ndie, but some larger than others.  They were all linked together by\\nslender wires.  These bits of wood were covered, on every square, with\\npaper pasted on them; and on these papers were written all the words of\\ntheir language, in their several moods, tenses, and declensions; but\\nwithout any order.  The professor then desired me “to observe; for he was\\ngoing to set his engine at work.”  The pupils, at his command, took each\\nof them hold of an iron handle, whereof there were forty fixed round the\\nedges of the frame; and giving them a sudden turn, the whole disposition\\nof the words was entirely changed.  He then commanded six-and-thirty of\\nthe lads, to read the several lines softly, as they appeared upon the\\nframe; and where they found three or four words together that might make\\npart of a sentence, they dictated to the four remaining boys, who were\\nscribes.  This work was repeated three or four times, and at every turn,\\nthe engine was so contrived, that the words shifted into new places, as\\nthe square bits of wood moved upside down.\\n\\n                           [Picture: The frame]\\n\\nSix hours a day the young students were employed in this labour; and the\\nprofessor showed me several volumes in large folio, already collected, of\\nbroken sentences, which he intended to piece together, and out of those\\nrich materials, to give the world a complete body of all arts and\\nsciences; which, however, might be still improved, and much expedited, if\\nthe public would raise a fund for making and employing five hundred such\\nframes in Lagado, and oblige the managers to contribute in common their\\nseveral collections.\\n\\nHe assured me “that this invention had employed all his thoughts from his\\nyouth; that he had emptied the whole vocabulary into his frame, and made\\nthe strictest computation of the general proportion there is in books\\nbetween the numbers of particles, nouns, and verbs, and other parts of\\nspeech.”\\n\\nI made my humblest acknowledgment to this illustrious person, for his\\ngreat communicativeness; and promised, “if ever I had the good fortune to\\nreturn to my native country, that I would do him justice, as the sole\\ninventor of this wonderful machine;” the form and contrivance of which I\\ndesired leave to delineate on paper, as in the figure here annexed.  I\\ntold him, “although it were the custom of our learned in Europe to steal\\ninventions from each other, who had thereby at least this advantage, that\\nit became a controversy which was the right owner; yet I would take such\\ncaution, that he should have the honour entire, without a rival.”\\n\\nWe next went to the school of languages, where three professors sat in\\nconsultation upon improving that of their own country.\\n\\nThe first project was, to shorten discourse, by cutting polysyllables\\ninto one, and leaving out verbs and participles, because, in reality, all\\nthings imaginable are but norms.\\n\\nThe other project was, a scheme for entirely abolishing all words\\nwhatsoever; and this was urged as a great advantage in point of health,\\nas well as brevity.  For it is plain, that every word we speak is, in\\nsome degree, a diminution of our lunge by corrosion, and, consequently,\\ncontributes to the shortening of our lives.  An expedient was therefore\\noffered, “that since words are only names for things, it would be more\\nconvenient for all men to carry about them such things as were necessary\\nto express a particular business they are to discourse on.”  And this\\ninvention would certainly have taken place, to the great ease as well as\\nhealth of the subject, if the women, in conjunction with the vulgar and\\nilliterate, had not threatened to raise a rebellion unless they might be\\nallowed the liberty to speak with their tongues, after the manner of\\ntheir forefathers; such constant irreconcilable enemies to science are\\nthe common people.  However, many of the most learned and wise adhere to\\nthe new scheme of expressing themselves by things; which has only this\\ninconvenience attending it, that if a man’s business be very great, and\\nof various kinds, he must be obliged, in proportion, to carry a greater\\nbundle of things upon his back, unless he can afford one or two strong\\nservants to attend him.  I have often beheld two of those sages almost\\nsinking under the weight of their packs, like pedlars among us, who, when\\nthey met in the street, would lay down their loads, open their sacks, and\\nhold conversation for an hour together; then put up their implements,\\nhelp each other to resume their burdens, and take their leave.\\n\\nBut for short conversations, a man may carry implements in his pockets,\\nand under his arms, enough to supply him; and in his house, he cannot be\\nat a loss.  Therefore the room where company meet who practise this art,\\nis full of all things, ready at hand, requisite to furnish matter for\\nthis kind of artificial converse.\\n\\nAnother great advantage proposed by this invention was, that it would\\nserve as a universal language, to be understood in all civilised nations,\\nwhose goods and utensils are generally of the same kind, or nearly\\nresembling, so that their uses might easily be comprehended.  And thus\\nambassadors would be qualified to treat with foreign princes, or\\nministers of state, to whose tongues they were utter strangers.\\n\\nI was at the mathematical school, where the master taught his pupils\\nafter a method scarce imaginable to us in Europe.  The proposition, and\\ndemonstration, were fairly written on a thin wafer, with ink composed of\\na cephalic tincture.  This, the student was to swallow upon a fasting\\nstomach, and for three days following, eat nothing but bread and water.\\nAs the wafer digested, the tincture mounted to his brain, bearing the\\nproposition along with it.  But the success has not hitherto been\\nanswerable, partly by some error in the _quantum_ or composition, and\\npartly by the perverseness of lads, to whom this bolus is so nauseous,\\nthat they generally steal aside, and discharge it upwards, before it can\\noperate; neither have they been yet persuaded to use so long an\\nabstinence, as the prescription requires.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\n\\nA further account of the academy.  The author proposes some improvements,\\nwhich are honourably received.\\n\\nIn the school of political projectors, I was but ill entertained; the\\nprofessors appearing, in my judgment, wholly out of their senses, which\\nis a scene that never fails to make me melancholy.  These unhappy people\\nwere proposing schemes for persuading monarchs to choose favourites upon\\nthe score of their wisdom, capacity, and virtue; of teaching ministers to\\nconsult the public good; of rewarding merit, great abilities, eminent\\nservices; of instructing princes to know their true interest, by placing\\nit on the same foundation with that of their people; of choosing for\\nemployments persons qualified to exercise them, with many other wild,\\nimpossible chimeras, that never entered before into the heart of man to\\nconceive; and confirmed in me the old observation, “that there is nothing\\nso extravagant and irrational, which some philosophers have not\\nmaintained for truth.”\\n\\nBut, however, I shall so far do justice to this part of the Academy, as\\nto acknowledge that all of them were not so visionary.  There was a most\\ningenious doctor, who seemed to be perfectly versed in the whole nature\\nand system of government.  This illustrious person had very usefully\\nemployed his studies, in finding out effectual remedies for all diseases\\nand corruptions to which the several kinds of public administration are\\nsubject, by the vices or infirmities of those who govern, as well as by\\nthe licentiousness of those who are to obey.  For instance: whereas all\\nwriters and reasoners have agreed, that there is a strict universal\\nresemblance between the natural and the political body; can there be any\\nthing more evident, than that the health of both must be preserved, and\\nthe diseases cured, by the same prescriptions?  It is allowed, that\\nsenates and great councils are often troubled with redundant, ebullient,\\nand other peccant humours; with many diseases of the head, and more of\\nthe heart; with strong convulsions, with grievous contractions of the\\nnerves and sinews in both hands, but especially the right; with spleen,\\nflatus, vertigos, and deliriums; with scrofulous tumours, full of fetid\\npurulent matter; with sour frothy ructations: with canine appetites, and\\ncrudeness of digestion, besides many others, needless to mention.  This\\ndoctor therefore proposed, “that upon the meeting of the senate, certain\\nphysicians should attend it the three first days of their sitting, and at\\nthe close of each day’s debate feel the pulses of every senator; after\\nwhich, having maturely considered and consulted upon the nature of the\\nseveral maladies, and the methods of cure, they should on the fourth day\\nreturn to the senate house, attended by their apothecaries stored with\\nproper medicines; and before the members sat, administer to each of them\\nlenitives, aperitives, abstersives, corrosives, restringents,\\npalliatives, laxatives, cephalalgics, icterics, apophlegmatics,\\nacoustics, as their several cases required; and, according as these\\nmedicines should operate, repeat, alter, or omit them, at the next\\nmeeting.”\\n\\nThis project could not be of any great expense to the public; and might\\nin my poor opinion, be of much use for the despatch of business, in those\\ncountries where senates have any share in the legislative power; beget\\nunanimity, shorten debates, open a few mouths which are now closed, and\\nclose many more which are now open; curb the petulancy of the young, and\\ncorrect the positiveness of the old; rouse the stupid, and damp the pert.\\n\\nAgain: because it is a general complaint, that the favourites of princes\\nare troubled with short and weak memories; the same doctor proposed,\\n“that whoever attended a first minister, after having told his business,\\nwith the utmost brevity and in the plainest words, should, at his\\ndeparture, give the said minister a tweak by the nose, or a kick in the\\nbelly, or tread on his corns, or lug him thrice by both ears, or run a\\npin into his breech; or pinch his arm black and blue, to prevent\\nforgetfulness; and at every levee day, repeat the same operation, till\\nthe business were done, or absolutely refused.”\\n\\nHe likewise directed, “that every senator in the great council of a\\nnation, after he had delivered his opinion, and argued in the defence of\\nit, should be obliged to give his vote directly contrary; because if that\\nwere done, the result would infallibly terminate in the good of the\\npublic.”\\n\\nWhen parties in a state are violent, he offered a wonderful contrivance\\nto reconcile them.  The method is this: You take a hundred leaders of\\neach party; you dispose them into couples of such whose heads are nearest\\nof a size; then let two nice operators saw off the occiput of each couple\\nat the same time, in such a manner that the brain may be equally divided.\\nLet the occiputs, thus cut off, be interchanged, applying each to the\\nhead of his opposite party-man.  It seems indeed to be a work that\\nrequires some exactness, but the professor assured us, “that if it were\\ndexterously performed, the cure would be infallible.”  For he argued\\nthus: “that the two half brains being left to debate the matter between\\nthemselves within the space of one skull, would soon come to a good\\nunderstanding, and produce that moderation, as well as regularity of\\nthinking, so much to be wished for in the heads of those, who imagine\\nthey come into the world only to watch and govern its motion: and as to\\nthe difference of brains, in quantity or quality, among those who are\\ndirectors in faction, the doctor assured us, from his own knowledge, that\\n“it was a perfect trifle.”\\n\\nI heard a very warm debate between two professors, about the most\\ncommodious and effectual ways and means of raising money, without\\ngrieving the subject.  The first affirmed, “the justest method would be,\\nto lay a certain tax upon vices and folly; and the sum fixed upon every\\nman to be rated, after the fairest manner, by a jury of his neighbours.”\\nThe second was of an opinion directly contrary; “to tax those qualities\\nof body and mind, for which men chiefly value themselves; the rate to be\\nmore or less, according to the degrees of excelling; the decision whereof\\nshould be left entirely to their own breast.”  The highest tax was upon\\nmen who are the greatest favourites of the other sex, and the\\nassessments, according to the number and nature of the favours they have\\nreceived; for which, they are allowed to be their own vouchers.  Wit,\\nvalour, and politeness, were likewise proposed to be largely taxed, and\\ncollected in the same manner, by every person’s giving his own word for\\nthe quantum of what he possessed.  But as to honour, justice, wisdom, and\\nlearning, they should not be taxed at all; because they are\\nqualifications of so singular a kind, that no man will either allow them\\nin his neighbour or value them in himself.\\n\\nThe women were proposed to be taxed according to their beauty and skill\\nin dressing, wherein they had the same privilege with the men, to be\\ndetermined by their own judgment.  But constancy, chastity, good sense,\\nand good nature, were not rated, because they would not bear the charge\\nof collecting.\\n\\nTo keep senators in the interest of the crown, it was proposed that the\\nmembers should raffle for employment; every man first taking an oath, and\\ngiving security, that he would vote for the court, whether he won or not;\\nafter which, the losers had, in their turn, the liberty of raffling upon\\nthe next vacancy.  Thus, hope and expectation would be kept alive; none\\nwould complain of broken promises, but impute their disappointments\\nwholly to fortune, whose shoulders are broader and stronger than those of\\na ministry.\\n\\nAnother professor showed me a large paper of instructions for discovering\\nplots and conspiracies against the government.  He advised great\\nstatesmen to examine into the diet of all suspected persons; their times\\nof eating; upon which side they lay in bed; with which hand they wipe\\ntheir posteriors; take a strict view of their excrements, and, from the\\ncolour, the odour, the taste, the consistence, the crudeness or maturity\\nof digestion, form a judgment of their thoughts and designs; because men\\nare never so serious, thoughtful, and intent, as when they are at stool,\\nwhich he found by frequent experiment; for, in such conjunctures, when he\\nused, merely as a trial, to consider which was the best way of murdering\\nthe king, his ordure would have a tincture of green; but quite different,\\nwhen he thought only of raising an insurrection, or burning the\\nmetropolis.\\n\\nThe whole discourse was written with great acuteness, containing many\\nobservations, both curious and useful for politicians; but, as I\\nconceived, not altogether complete.  This I ventured to tell the author,\\nand offered, if he pleased, to supply him with some additions.  He\\nreceived my proposition with more compliance than is usual among writers,\\nespecially those of the projecting species, professing “he would be glad\\nto receive further information.”\\n\\nI told him, “that in the kingdom of Tribnia, {454a} by the natives called\\nLangdon, {454b} where I had sojourned some time in my travels, the bulk\\nof the people consist in a manner wholly of discoverers, witnesses,\\ninformers, accusers, prosecutors, evidences, swearers, together with\\ntheir several subservient and subaltern instruments, all under the\\ncolours, the conduct, and the pay of ministers of state, and their\\ndeputies.  The plots, in that kingdom, are usually the workmanship of\\nthose persons who desire to raise their own characters of profound\\npoliticians; to restore new vigour to a crazy administration; to stifle\\nor divert general discontents; to fill their coffers with forfeitures;\\nand raise, or sink the opinion of public credit, as either shall best\\nanswer their private advantage.  It is first agreed and settled among\\nthem, what suspected persons shall be accused of a plot; then, effectual\\ncare is taken to secure all their letters and papers, and put the owners\\nin chains.  These papers are delivered to a set of artists, very\\ndexterous in finding out the mysterious meanings of words, syllables, and\\nletters: for instance, they can discover a close stool, to signify a\\nprivy council; a flock of geese, a senate; a lame dog, an invader; the\\nplague, a standing army; a buzzard, a prime minister; the gout, a high\\npriest; a gibbet, a secretary of state; a chamber pot, a committee of\\ngrandees; a sieve, a court lady; a broom, a revolution; a mouse-trap, an\\nemployment; a bottomless pit, a treasury; a sink, a court; a cap and\\nbells, a favourite; a broken reed, a court of justice; an empty tun, a\\ngeneral; a running sore, the administration. {455}\\n\\n“When this method fails, they have two others more effectual, which the\\nlearned among them call acrostics and anagrams.  First, they can decipher\\nall initial letters into political meanings.  Thus _N_, shall signify a\\nplot; _B_, a regiment of horse; _L_, a fleet at sea; or, secondly, by\\ntransposing the letters of the alphabet in any suspected paper, they can\\nlay open the deepest designs of a discontented party.  So, for example,\\nif I should say, in a letter to a friend, ‘Our brother Tom has just got\\nthe piles,’ a skilful decipherer would discover, that the same letters\\nwhich compose that sentence, may be analysed into the following words,\\n‘Resist ---, a plot is brought home—The tour.’  And this is the\\nanagrammatic method.”\\n\\nThe professor made me great acknowledgments for communicating these\\nobservations, and promised to make honourable mention of me in his\\ntreatise.\\n\\nI saw nothing in this country that could invite me to a longer\\ncontinuance, and began to think of returning home to England.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\n\\nThe author leaves Lagado: arrives at Maldonada.  No ship ready.  He takes\\na short voyage to Glubbdubdrib.  His reception by the governor.\\n\\nThe continent, of which this kingdom is apart, extends itself, as I have\\nreason to believe, eastward, to that unknown tract of America westward of\\nCalifornia; and north, to the Pacific Ocean, which is not above a hundred\\nand fifty miles from Lagado; where there is a good port, and much\\ncommerce with the great island of Luggnagg, situated to the north-west\\nabout 29 degrees north latitude, and 140 longitude.  This island of\\nLuggnagg stands south-eastward of Japan, about a hundred leagues distant.\\nThere is a strict alliance between the Japanese emperor and the king of\\nLuggnagg; which affords frequent opportunities of sailing from one island\\nto the other.  I determined therefore to direct my course this way, in\\norder to my return to Europe.  I hired two mules, with a guide, to show\\nme the way, and carry my small baggage.  I took leave of my noble\\nprotector, who had shown me so much favour, and made me a generous\\npresent at my departure.\\n\\nMy journey was without any accident or adventure worth relating.  When I\\narrived at the port of Maldonada (for so it is called) there was no ship\\nin the harbour bound for Luggnagg, nor likely to be in some time.  The\\ntown is about as large as Portsmouth.  I soon fell into some\\nacquaintance, and was very hospitably received.  A gentleman of\\ndistinction said to me, “that since the ships bound for Luggnagg could\\nnot be ready in less than a month, it might be no disagreeable amusement\\nfor me to take a trip to the little island of Glubbdubdrib, about five\\nleagues off to the south-west.”  He offered himself and a friend to\\naccompany me, and that I should be provided with a small convenient bark\\nfor the voyage.\\n\\nGlubbdubdrib, as nearly as I can interpret the word, signifies the island\\nof sorcerers or magicians.  It is about one third as large as the Isle of\\nWight, and extremely fruitful: it is governed by the head of a certain\\ntribe, who are all magicians.  This tribe marries only among each other,\\nand the eldest in succession is prince or governor.  He has a noble\\npalace, and a park of about three thousand acres, surrounded by a wall of\\nhewn stone twenty feet high.  In this park are several small enclosures\\nfor cattle, corn, and gardening.\\n\\nThe governor and his family are served and attended by domestics of a\\nkind somewhat unusual.  By his skill in necromancy he has a power of\\ncalling whom he pleases from the dead, and commanding their service for\\ntwenty-four hours, but no longer; nor can he call the same persons up\\nagain in less than three months, except upon very extraordinary\\noccasions.\\n\\nWhen we arrived at the island, which was about eleven in the morning, one\\nof the gentlemen who accompanied me went to the governor, and desired\\nadmittance for a stranger, who came on purpose to have the honour of\\nattending on his highness.  This was immediately granted, and we all\\nthree entered the gate of the palace between two rows of guards, armed\\nand dressed after a very antic manner, and with something in their\\ncountenances that made my flesh creep with a horror I cannot express.  We\\npassed through several apartments, between servants of the same sort,\\nranked on each side as before, till we came to the chamber of presence;\\nwhere, after three profound obeisances, and a few general questions, we\\nwere permitted to sit on three stools, near the lowest step of his\\nhighness’s throne.  He understood the language of Balnibarbi, although it\\nwas different from that of this island.  He desired me to give him some\\naccount of my travels; and, to let me see that I should be treated\\nwithout ceremony, he dismissed all his attendants with a turn of his\\nfinger; at which, to my great astonishment, they vanished in an instant,\\nlike visions in a dream when we awake on a sudden.  I could not recover\\nmyself in some time, till the governor assured me, “that I should receive\\nno hurt:” and observing my two companions to be under no concern, who had\\nbeen often entertained in the same manner, I began to take courage, and\\nrelated to his highness a short history of my several adventures; yet not\\nwithout some hesitation, and frequently looking behind me to the place\\nwhere I had seen those domestic spectres.  I had the honour to dine with\\nthe governor, where a new set of ghosts served up the meat, and waited at\\ntable.  I now observed myself to be less terrified than I had been in the\\nmorning.  I stayed till sunset, but humbly desired his highness to excuse\\nme for not accepting his invitation of lodging in the palace.  My two\\nfriends and I lay at a private house in the town adjoining, which is the\\ncapital of this little island; and the next morning we returned to pay\\nour duty to the governor, as he was pleased to command us.\\n\\nAfter this manner we continued in the island for ten days, most part of\\nevery day with the governor, and at night in our lodging.  I soon grew so\\nfamiliarized to the sight of spirits, that after the third or fourth time\\nthey gave me no emotion at all: or, if I had any apprehensions left, my\\ncuriosity prevailed over them.  For his highness the governor ordered me\\n“to call up whatever persons I would choose to name, and in whatever\\nnumbers, among all the dead from the beginning of the world to the\\npresent time, and command them to answer any questions I should think fit\\nto ask; with this condition, that my questions must be confined within\\nthe compass of the times they lived in.  And one thing I might depend\\nupon, that they would certainly tell me the truth, for lying was a talent\\nof no use in the lower world.”\\n\\nI made my humble acknowledgments to his highness for so great a favour.\\nWe were in a chamber, from whence there was a fair prospect into the\\npark.  And because my first inclination was to be entertained with scenes\\nof pomp and magnificence, I desired to see Alexander the Great at the\\nhead of his army, just after the battle of Arbela: which, upon a motion\\nof the governor’s finger, immediately appeared in a large field, under\\nthe window where we stood.  Alexander was called up into the room: it was\\nwith great difficulty that I understood his Greek, and had but little of\\nmy own.  He assured me upon his honour “that he was not poisoned, but\\ndied of a bad fever by excessive drinking.”\\n\\nNext, I saw Hannibal passing the Alps, who told me “he had not a drop of\\nvinegar in his camp.”\\n\\nI saw Cæsar and Pompey at the head of their troops, just ready to engage.\\nI saw the former, in his last great triumph.  I desired that the senate\\nof Rome might appear before me, in one large chamber, and an assembly of\\nsomewhat a later age in counterview, in another.  The first seemed to be\\nan assembly of heroes and demigods; the other, a knot of pedlars,\\npick-pockets, highwayman, and bullies.\\n\\nThe governor, at my request, gave the sign for Cæsar and Brutus to\\nadvance towards us.  I was struck with a profound veneration at the sight\\nof Brutus, and could easily discover the most consummate virtue, the\\ngreatest intrepidity and firmness of mind, the truest love of his\\ncountry, and general benevolence for mankind, in every lineament of his\\ncountenance.  I observed, with much pleasure, that these two persons were\\nin good intelligence with each other; and Cæsar freely confessed to me,\\n“that the greatest actions of his own life were not equal, by many\\ndegrees, to the glory of taking it away.”  I had the honour to have much\\nconversation with Brutus; and was told, “that his ancestor Junius,\\nSocrates, Epaminondas, Cato the younger, Sir Thomas More, and himself\\nwere perpetually together:” a sextumvirate, to which all the ages of the\\nworld cannot add a seventh.\\n\\nIt would be tedious to trouble the reader with relating what vast numbers\\nof illustrious persons were called up to gratify that insatiable desire I\\nhad to see the world in every period of antiquity placed before me.  I\\nchiefly fed mine eyes with beholding the destroyers of tyrants and\\nusurpers, and the restorers of liberty to oppressed and injured nations.\\nBut it is impossible to express the satisfaction I received in my own\\nmind, after such a manner as to make it a suitable entertainment to the\\nreader.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\n\\nA further account of Glubbdubdrib.  Ancient and modern history corrected.\\n\\nHaving a desire to see those ancients who were most renowned for wit and\\nlearning, I set apart one day on purpose.  I proposed that Homer and\\nAristotle might appear at the head of all their commentators; but these\\nwere so numerous, that some hundreds were forced to attend in the court,\\nand outward rooms of the palace.  I knew, and could distinguish those two\\nheroes, at first sight, not only from the crowd, but from each other.\\nHomer was the taller and comelier person of the two, walked very erect\\nfor one of his age, and his eyes were the most quick and piercing I ever\\nbeheld.  Aristotle stooped much, and made use of a staff.  His visage was\\nmeagre, his hair lank and thin, and his voice hollow.  I soon discovered\\nthat both of them were perfect strangers to the rest of the company, and\\nhad never seen or heard of them before; and I had a whisper from a ghost\\nwho shall be nameless, “that these commentators always kept in the most\\ndistant quarters from their principals, in the lower world, through a\\nconsciousness of shame and guilt, because they had so horribly\\nmisrepresented the meaning of those authors to posterity.”  I introduced\\nDidymus and Eustathius to Homer, and prevailed on him to treat them\\nbetter than perhaps they deserved, for he soon found they wanted a genius\\nto enter into the spirit of a poet.  But Aristotle was out of all\\npatience with the account I gave him of Scotus and Ramus, as I presented\\nthem to him; and he asked them, “whether the rest of the tribe were as\\ngreat dunces as themselves?”\\n\\nI then desired the governor to call up Descartes and Gassendi, with whom\\nI prevailed to explain their systems to Aristotle.  This great\\nphilosopher freely acknowledged his own mistakes in natural philosophy,\\nbecause he proceeded in many things upon conjecture, as all men must do;\\nand he found that Gassendi, who had made the doctrine of Epicurus as\\npalatable as he could, and the vortices of Descartes, were equally to be\\nexploded.  He predicted the same fate to _attraction_, whereof the\\npresent learned are such zealous asserters.  He said, “that new systems\\nof nature were but new fashions, which would vary in every age; and even\\nthose, who pretend to demonstrate them from mathematical principles,\\nwould flourish but a short period of time, and be out of vogue when that\\nwas determined.”\\n\\nI spent five days in conversing with many others of the ancient learned.\\nI saw most of the first Roman emperors.  I prevailed on the governor to\\ncall up Heliogabalus’s cooks to dress us a dinner, but they could not\\nshow us much of their skill, for want of materials.  A helot of Agesilaus\\nmade us a dish of Spartan broth, but I was not able to get down a second\\nspoonful.\\n\\nThe two gentlemen, who conducted me to the island, were pressed by their\\nprivate affairs to return in three days, which I employed in seeing some\\nof the modern dead, who had made the greatest figure, for two or three\\nhundred years past, in our own and other countries of Europe; and having\\nbeen always a great admirer of old illustrious families, I desired the\\ngovernor would call up a dozen or two of kings, with their ancestors in\\norder for eight or nine generations.  But my disappointment was grievous\\nand unexpected.  For, instead of a long train with royal diadems, I saw\\nin one family two fiddlers, three spruce courtiers, and an Italian\\nprelate.  In another, a barber, an abbot, and two cardinals.  I have too\\ngreat a veneration for crowned heads, to dwell any longer on so nice a\\nsubject.  But as to counts, marquises, dukes, earls, and the like, I was\\nnot so scrupulous.  And I confess, it was not without some pleasure, that\\nI found myself able to trace the particular features, by which certain\\nfamilies are distinguished, up to their originals.  I could plainly\\ndiscover whence one family derives a long chin; why a second has abounded\\nwith knaves for two generations, and fools for two more; why a third\\nhappened to be crack-brained, and a fourth to be sharpers; whence it\\ncame, what Polydore Virgil says of a certain great house, _Nec vir\\nfortis_, _nec foemina casta_; how cruelty, falsehood, and cowardice, grew\\nto be characteristics by which certain families are distinguished as much\\nas by their coats of arms; who first brought the pox into a noble house,\\nwhich has lineally descended scrofulous tumours to their posterity.\\nNeither could I wonder at all this, when I saw such an interruption of\\nlineages, by pages, lackeys, valets, coachmen, gamesters, fiddlers,\\nplayers, captains, and pickpockets.\\n\\nI was chiefly disgusted with modern history.  For having strictly\\nexamined all the persons of greatest name in the courts of princes, for a\\nhundred years past, I found how the world had been misled by prostitute\\nwriters, to ascribe the greatest exploits in war, to cowards; the wisest\\ncounsel, to fools; sincerity, to flatterers; Roman virtue, to betrayers\\nof their country; piety, to atheists; chastity, to sodomites; truth, to\\ninformers: how many innocent and excellent persons had been condemned to\\ndeath or banishment by the practising of great ministers upon the\\ncorruption of judges, and the malice of factions: how many villains had\\nbeen exalted to the highest places of trust, power, dignity, and profit:\\nhow great a share in the motions and events of courts, councils, and\\nsenates might be challenged by bawds, whores, pimps, parasites, and\\nbuffoons.  How low an opinion I had of human wisdom and integrity, when I\\nwas truly informed of the springs and motives of great enterprises and\\nrevolutions in the world, and of the contemptible accidents to which they\\nowed their success.\\n\\nHere I discovered the roguery and ignorance of those who pretend to write\\nanecdotes, or secret history; who send so many kings to their graves with\\na cup of poison; will repeat the discourse between a prince and chief\\nminister, where no witness was by; unlock the thoughts and cabinets of\\nambassadors and secretaries of state; and have the perpetual misfortune\\nto be mistaken.  Here I discovered the true causes of many great events\\nthat have surprised the world; how a whore can govern the back-stairs,\\nthe back-stairs a council, and the council a senate.  A general\\nconfessed, in my presence, “that he got a victory purely by the force of\\ncowardice and ill conduct;” and an admiral, “that, for want of proper\\nintelligence, he beat the enemy, to whom he intended to betray the\\nfleet.”  Three kings protested to me, “that in their whole reigns they\\nnever did once prefer any person of merit, unless by mistake, or\\ntreachery of some minister in whom they confided; neither would they do\\nit if they were to live again:” and they showed, with great strength of\\nreason, “that the royal throne could not be supported without corruption,\\nbecause that positive, confident, restiff temper, which virtue infused\\ninto a man, was a perpetual clog to public business.”\\n\\nI had the curiosity to inquire in a particular manner, by what methods\\ngreat numbers had procured to themselves high titles of honour, and\\nprodigious estates; and I confined my inquiry to a very modern period:\\nhowever, without grating upon present times, because I would be sure to\\ngive no offence even to foreigners (for I hope the reader need not be\\ntold, that I do not in the least intend my own country, in what I say\\nupon this occasion,) a great number of persons concerned were called up;\\nand, upon a very slight examination, discovered such a scene of infamy,\\nthat I cannot reflect upon it without some seriousness.  Perjury,\\noppression, subornation, fraud, pandarism, and the like infirmities, were\\namong the most excusable arts they had to mention; and for these I gave,\\nas it was reasonable, great allowance.  But when some confessed they owed\\ntheir greatness and wealth to sodomy, or incest; others, to the\\nprostituting of their own wives and daughters; others, to the betraying\\nof their country or their prince; some, to poisoning; more to the\\nperverting of justice, in order to destroy the innocent, I hope I may be\\npardoned, if these discoveries inclined me a little to abate of that\\nprofound veneration, which I am naturally apt to pay to persons of high\\nrank, who ought to be treated with the utmost respect due to their\\nsublime dignity, by us their inferiors.\\n\\nI had often read of some great services done to princes and states, and\\ndesired to see the persons by whom those services were performed.  Upon\\ninquiry I was told, “that their names were to be found on no record,\\nexcept a few of them, whom history has represented as the vilest of\\nrogues and traitors.”  As to the rest, I had never once heard of them.\\nThey all appeared with dejected looks, and in the meanest habit; most of\\nthem telling me, “they died in poverty and disgrace, and the rest on a\\nscaffold or a gibbet.”\\n\\nAmong others, there was one person, whose case appeared a little\\nsingular.  He had a youth about eighteen years old standing by his side.\\nHe told me, “he had for many years been commander of a ship; and in the\\nsea fight at Actium had the good fortune to break through the enemy’s\\ngreat line of battle, sink three of their capital ships, and take a\\nfourth, which was the sole cause of Antony’s flight, and of the victory\\nthat ensued; that the youth standing by him, his only son, was killed in\\nthe action.”  He added, “that upon the confidence of some merit, the war\\nbeing at an end, he went to Rome, and solicited at the court of Augustus\\nto be preferred to a greater ship, whose commander had been killed; but,\\nwithout any regard to his pretensions, it was given to a boy who had\\nnever seen the sea, the son of Libertina, who waited on one of the\\nemperor’s mistresses.  Returning back to his own vessel, he was charged\\nwith neglect of duty, and the ship given to a favourite page of\\nPublicola, the vice-admiral; whereupon he retired to a poor farm at a\\ngreat distance from Rome, and there ended his life.”  I was so curious to\\nknow the truth of this story, that I desired Agrippa might be called, who\\nwas admiral in that fight.  He appeared, and confirmed the whole account:\\nbut with much more advantage to the captain, whose modesty had extenuated\\nor concealed a great part of his merit.\\n\\nI was surprised to find corruption grown so high and so quick in that\\nempire, by the force of luxury so lately introduced; which made me less\\nwonder at many parallel cases in other countries, where vices of all\\nkinds have reigned so much longer, and where the whole praise, as well as\\npillage, has been engrossed by the chief commander, who perhaps had the\\nleast title to either.\\n\\nAs every person called up made exactly the same appearance he had done in\\nthe world, it gave me melancholy reflections to observe how much the race\\nof human kind was degenerated among us within these hundred years past;\\nhow the pox, under all its consequences and denominations had altered\\nevery lineament of an English countenance; shortened the size of bodies,\\nunbraced the nerves, relaxed the sinews and muscles, introduced a sallow\\ncomplexion, and rendered the flesh loose and rancid.\\n\\nI descended so low, as to desire some English yeoman of the old stamp\\nmight be summoned to appear; once so famous for the simplicity of their\\nmanners, diet, and dress; for justice in their dealings; for their true\\nspirit of liberty; for their valour, and love of their country.  Neither\\ncould I be wholly unmoved, after comparing the living with the dead, when\\nI considered how all these pure native virtues were prostituted for a\\npiece of money by their grand-children; who, in selling their votes and\\nmanaging at elections, have acquired every vice and corruption that can\\npossibly be learned in a court.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\n\\n\\nThe author returns to Maldonada.  Sails to the kingdom of Luggnagg.  The\\nauthor confined.  He is sent for to court.  The manner of his admittance.\\nThe king’s great lenity to his subjects.\\n\\nThe day of our departure being come, I took leave of his highness, the\\nGovernor of Glubbdubdrib, and returned with my two companions to\\nMaldonada, where, after a fortnight’s waiting, a ship was ready to sail\\nfor Luggnagg.  The two gentlemen, and some others, were so generous and\\nkind as to furnish me with provisions, and see me on board.  I was a\\nmonth in this voyage.  We had one violent storm, and were under a\\nnecessity of steering westward to get into the trade wind, which holds\\nfor above sixty leagues.  On the 21st of April, 1708, we sailed into the\\nriver of Clumegnig, which is a seaport town, at the south-east point of\\nLuggnagg.  We cast anchor within a league of the town, and made a signal\\nfor a pilot.  Two of them came on board in less than half an hour, by\\nwhom we were guided between certain shoals and rocks, which are very\\ndangerous in the passage, to a large basin, where a fleet may ride in\\nsafety within a cable’s length of the town-wall.\\n\\nSome of our sailors, whether out of treachery or inadvertence, had\\ninformed the pilots “that I was a stranger, and great traveller;” whereof\\nthese gave notice to a custom-house officer, by whom I was examined very\\nstrictly upon my landing.  This officer spoke to me in the language of\\nBalnibarbi, which, by the force of much commerce, is generally understood\\nin that town, especially by seamen and those employed in the customs.  I\\ngave him a short account of some particulars, and made my story as\\nplausible and consistent as I could; but I thought it necessary to\\ndisguise my country, and call myself a Hollander; because my intentions\\nwere for Japan, and I knew the Dutch were the only Europeans permitted to\\nenter into that kingdom.  I therefore told the officer, “that having been\\nshipwrecked on the coast of Balnibarbi, and cast on a rock, I was\\nreceived up into Laputa, or the flying island (of which he had often\\nheard), and was now endeavouring to get to Japan, whence I might find a\\nconvenience of returning to my own country.”  The officer said, “I must\\nbe confined till he could receive orders from court, for which he would\\nwrite immediately, and hoped to receive an answer in a fortnight.”  I was\\ncarried to a convenient lodging with a sentry placed at the door;\\nhowever, I had the liberty of a large garden, and was treated with\\nhumanity enough, being maintained all the time at the king’s charge.  I\\nwas invited by several persons, chiefly out of curiosity, because it was\\nreported that I came from countries very remote, of which they had never\\nheard.\\n\\nI hired a young man, who came in the same ship, to be an interpreter; he\\nwas a native of Luggnagg, but had lived some years at Maldonada, and was\\na perfect master of both languages.  By his assistance, I was able to\\nhold a conversation with those who came to visit me; but this consisted\\nonly of their questions, and my answers.\\n\\nThe despatch came from court about the time we expected.  It contained a\\nwarrant for conducting me and my retinue to _Traldragdubh_, or\\n_Trildrogdrib_ (for it is pronounced both ways as near as I can\\nremember), by a party of ten horse.  All my retinue was that poor lad for\\nan interpreter, whom I persuaded into my service, and, at my humble\\nrequest, we had each of us a mule to ride on.  A messenger was despatched\\nhalf a day’s journey before us, to give the king notice of my approach,\\nand to desire, “that his majesty would please to appoint a day and hour,\\nwhen it would by his gracious pleasure that I might have the honour to\\nlick the dust before his footstool.”  This is the court style, and I\\nfound it to be more than matter of form: for, upon my admittance two days\\nafter my arrival, I was commanded to crawl upon my belly, and lick the\\nfloor as I advanced; but, on account of my being a stranger, care was\\ntaken to have it made so clean, that the dust was not offensive.\\nHowever, this was a peculiar grace, not allowed to any but persons of the\\nhighest rank, when they desire an admittance.  Nay, sometimes the floor\\nis strewed with dust on purpose, when the person to be admitted happens\\nto have powerful enemies at court; and I have seen a great lord with his\\nmouth so crammed, that when he had crept to the proper distance from the\\nthrone; he was not able to speak a word.  Neither is there any remedy;\\nbecause it is capital for those, who receive an audience to spit or wipe\\ntheir mouths in his majesty’s presence.  There is indeed another custom,\\nwhich I cannot altogether approve of: when the king has a mind to put any\\nof his nobles to death in a gentle indulgent manner, he commands the\\nfloor to be strewed with a certain brown powder of a deadly composition,\\nwhich being licked up, infallibly kills him in twenty-four hours.  But in\\njustice to this prince’s great clemency, and the care he has of his\\nsubjects’ lives (wherein it were much to be wished that the Monarchs of\\nEurope would imitate him), it must be mentioned for his honour, that\\nstrict orders are given to have the infected parts of the floor well\\nwashed after every such execution, which, if his domestics neglect, they\\nare in danger of incurring his royal displeasure.  I myself heard him\\ngive directions, that one of his pages should be whipped, whose turn it\\nwas to give notice about washing the floor after an execution, but\\nmaliciously had omitted it; by which neglect a young lord of great hopes,\\ncoming to an audience, was unfortunately poisoned, although the king at\\nthat time had no design against his life.  But this good prince was so\\ngracious as to forgive the poor page his whipping, upon promise that he\\nwould do so no more, without special orders.\\n\\nTo return from this digression.  When I had crept within four yards of\\nthe throne, I raised myself gently upon my knees, and then striking my\\nforehead seven times against the ground, I pronounced the following\\nwords, as they had been taught me the night before, _Inckpling\\ngloffthrobb squut serummblhiop mlashnalt zwin tnodbalkuffh slhiophad\\ngurdlubh asht_.  This is the compliment, established by the laws of the\\nland, for all persons admitted to the king’s presence.  It may be\\nrendered into English thus: “May your celestial majesty outlive the sun,\\neleven moons and a half!”  To this the king returned some answer, which,\\nalthough I could not understand, yet I replied as I had been directed:\\n_Fluft drin yalerick dwuldom prastrad mirpush_, which properly signifies,\\n“My tongue is in the mouth of my friend;” and by this expression was\\nmeant, that I desired leave to bring my interpreter; whereupon the young\\nman already mentioned was accordingly introduced, by whose intervention I\\nanswered as many questions as his majesty could put in above an hour.  I\\nspoke in the Balnibarbian tongue, and my interpreter delivered my meaning\\nin that of Luggnagg.\\n\\nThe king was much delighted with my company, and ordered his\\n_bliffmarklub_, or high-chamberlain, to appoint a lodging in the court\\nfor me and my interpreter; with a daily allowance for my table, and a\\nlarge purse of gold for my common expenses.\\n\\nI staid three months in this country, out of perfect obedience to his\\nmajesty; who was pleased highly to favour me, and made me very honourable\\noffers.  But I thought it more consistent with prudence and justice to\\npass the remainder of my days with my wife and family.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\n\\n\\nThe Luggnaggians commended.  A particular description of the Struldbrugs,\\nwith many conversations between the author and some eminent persons upon\\nthat subject.\\n\\nThe Luggnaggians are a polite and generous people; and although they are\\nnot without some share of that pride which is peculiar to all Eastern\\ncountries, yet they show themselves courteous to strangers, especially\\nsuch who are countenanced by the court.  I had many acquaintance, and\\namong persons of the best fashion; and being always attended by my\\ninterpreter, the conversation we had was not disagreeable.\\n\\nOne day, in much good company, I was asked by a person of quality,\\n“whether I had seen any of their _struldbrugs_, or immortals?”  I said,\\n“I had not;” and desired he would explain to me “what he meant by such an\\nappellation, applied to a mortal creature.”  He told me “that sometimes,\\nthough very rarely, a child happened to be born in a family, with a red\\ncircular spot in the forehead, directly over the left eyebrow, which was\\nan infallible mark that it should never die.”  The spot, as he described\\nit, “was about the compass of a silver threepence, but in the course of\\ntime grew larger, and changed its colour; for at twelve years old it\\nbecame green, so continued till five and twenty, then turned to a deep\\nblue: at five and forty it grew coal black, and as large as an English\\nshilling; but never admitted any further alteration.”  He said, “these\\nbirths were so rare, that he did not believe there could be above eleven\\nhundred struldbrugs, of both sexes, in the whole kingdom; of which he\\ncomputed about fifty in the metropolis, and, among the rest, a young girl\\nborn; about three years ago: that these productions were not peculiar to\\nany family, but a mere effect of chance; and the children of the\\n_struldbrugs_ themselves were equally mortal with the rest of the\\npeople.”\\n\\nI freely own myself to have been struck with inexpressible delight, upon\\nhearing this account: and the person who gave it me happening to\\nunderstand the Balnibarbian language, which I spoke very well, I could\\nnot forbear breaking out into expressions, perhaps a little too\\nextravagant.  I cried out, as in a rapture, “Happy nation, where every\\nchild hath at least a chance for being immortal!  Happy people, who enjoy\\nso many living examples of ancient virtue, and have masters ready to\\ninstruct them in the wisdom of all former ages! but happiest, beyond all\\ncomparison, are those excellent _struldbrugs_, who, being born exempt\\nfrom that universal calamity of human nature, have their minds free and\\ndisengaged, without the weight and depression of spirits caused by the\\ncontinual apprehensions of death!”  I discovered my admiration that I had\\nnot observed any of these illustrious persons at court; the black spot on\\nthe forehead being so remarkable a distinction, that I could not have\\neasily overlooked it: and it was impossible that his majesty, a most\\njudicious prince, should not provide himself with a good number of such\\nwise and able counsellors.  Yet perhaps the virtue of those reverend\\nsages was too strict for the corrupt and libertine manners of a court:\\nand we often find by experience, that young men are too opinionated and\\nvolatile to be guided by the sober dictates of their seniors.  However,\\nsince the king was pleased to allow me access to his royal person, I was\\nresolved, upon the very first occasion, to deliver my opinion to him on\\nthis matter freely and at large, by the help of my interpreter; and\\nwhether he would please to take my advice or not, yet in one thing I was\\ndetermined, that his majesty having frequently offered me an\\nestablishment in this country, I would, with great thankfulness, accept\\nthe favour, and pass my life here in the conversation of those superior\\nbeings the _struldbrugs_, if they would please to admit me.”\\n\\nThe gentleman to whom I addressed my discourse, because (as I have\\nalready observed) he spoke the language of Balnibarbi, said to me, with a\\nsort of a smile which usually arises from pity to the ignorant, “that he\\nwas glad of any occasion to keep me among them, and desired my permission\\nto explain to the company what I had spoke.”  He did so, and they talked\\ntogether for some time in their own language, whereof I understood not a\\nsyllable, neither could I observe by their countenances, what impression\\nmy discourse had made on them.  After a short silence, the same person\\ntold me, “that his friends and mine (so he thought fit to express\\nhimself) were very much pleased with the judicious remarks I had made on\\nthe great happiness and advantages of immortal life, and they were\\ndesirous to know, in a particular manner, what scheme of living I should\\nhave formed to myself, if it had fallen to my lot to have been born a\\n_struldbrug_.”\\n\\nI answered, “it was easy to be eloquent on so copious and delightful a\\nsubject, especially to me, who had been often apt to amuse myself with\\nvisions of what I should do, if I were a king, a general, or a great\\nlord: and upon this very case, I had frequently run over the whole system\\nhow I should employ myself, and pass the time, if I were sure to live for\\never.\\n\\n“That, if it had been my good fortune to come into the world a\\n_struldbrug_, as soon as I could discover my own happiness, by\\nunderstanding the difference between life and death, I would first\\nresolve, by all arts and methods, whatsoever, to procure myself riches.\\nIn the pursuit of which, by thrift and management, I might reasonably\\nexpect, in about two hundred years, to be the wealthiest man in the\\nkingdom.  In the second place, I would, from my earliest youth, apply\\nmyself to the study of arts and sciences, by which I should arrive in\\ntime to excel all others in learning.  Lastly, I would carefully record\\nevery action and event of consequence, that happened in the public,\\nimpartially draw the characters of the several successions of princes and\\ngreat ministers of state, with my own observations on every point.  I\\nwould exactly set down the several changes in customs, language, fashions\\nof dress, diet, and diversions.  By all which acquirements, I should be a\\nliving treasure of knowledge and wisdom, and certainly become the oracle\\nof the nation.\\n\\n“I would never marry after threescore, but live in a hospitable manner,\\nyet still on the saving side.  I would entertain myself in forming and\\ndirecting the minds of hopeful young men, by convincing them, from my own\\nremembrance, experience, and observation, fortified by numerous examples,\\nof the usefulness of virtue in public and private life.  But my choice\\nand constant companions should be a set of my own immortal brotherhood;\\namong whom, I would elect a dozen from the most ancient, down to my own\\ncontemporaries.  Where any of these wanted fortunes, I would provide them\\nwith convenient lodges round my own estate, and have some of them always\\nat my table; only mingling a few of the most valuable among you mortals,\\nwhom length of time would harden me to lose with little or no reluctance,\\nand treat your posterity after the same manner; just as a man diverts\\nhimself with the annual succession of pinks and tulips in his garden,\\nwithout regretting the loss of those which withered the preceding year.\\n\\n“These _struldbrugs_ and I would mutually communicate our observations\\nand memorials, through the course of time; remark the several gradations\\nby which corruption steals into the world, and oppose it in every step,\\nby giving perpetual warning and instruction to mankind; which, added to\\nthe strong influence of our own example, would probably prevent that\\ncontinual degeneracy of human nature so justly complained of in all ages.\\n\\n“Add to this, the pleasure of seeing the various revolutions of states\\nand empires; the changes in the lower and upper world; ancient cities in\\nruins, and obscure villages become the seats of kings; famous rivers\\nlessening into shallow brooks; the ocean leaving one coast dry, and\\noverwhelming another; the discovery of many countries yet unknown;\\nbarbarity overrunning the politest nations, and the most barbarous become\\ncivilized.  I should then see the discovery of the longitude, the\\nperpetual motion, the universal medicine, and many other great\\ninventions, brought to the utmost perfection.\\n\\n“What wonderful discoveries should we make in astronomy, by outliving and\\nconfirming our own predictions; by observing the progress and return of\\ncomets, with the changes of motion in the sun, moon, and stars!”\\n\\nI enlarged upon many other topics, which the natural desire of endless\\nlife, and sublunary happiness, could easily furnish me with.  When I had\\nended, and the sum of my discourse had been interpreted, as before, to\\nthe rest of the company, there was a good deal of talk among them in the\\nlanguage of the country, not without some laughter at my expense.  At\\nlast, the same gentleman who had been my interpreter, said, “he was\\ndesired by the rest to set me right in a few mistakes, which I had fallen\\ninto through the common imbecility of human nature, and upon that\\nallowance was less answerable for them.  That this breed of _struldbrugs_\\nwas peculiar to their country, for there were no such people either in\\nBalnibarbi or Japan, where he had the honour to be ambassador from his\\nmajesty, and found the natives in both those kingdoms very hard to\\nbelieve that the fact was possible: and it appeared from my astonishment\\nwhen he first mentioned the matter to me, that I received it as a thing\\nwholly new, and scarcely to be credited.  That in the two kingdoms above\\nmentioned, where, during his residence, he had conversed very much, he\\nobserved long life to be the universal desire and wish of mankind.  That\\nwhoever had one foot in the grave was sure to hold back the other as\\nstrongly as he could.  That the oldest had still hopes of living one day\\nlonger, and looked on death as the greatest evil, from which nature\\nalways prompted him to retreat.  Only in this island of Luggnagg the\\nappetite for living was not so eager, from the continual example of the\\n_struldbrugs_ before their eyes.\\n\\n“That the system of living contrived by me, was unreasonable and unjust;\\nbecause it supposed a perpetuity of youth, health, and vigour, which no\\nman could be so foolish to hope, however extravagant he may be in his\\nwishes.  That the question therefore was not, whether a man would choose\\nto be always in the prime of youth, attended with prosperity and health;\\nbut how he would pass a perpetual life under all the usual disadvantages\\nwhich old age brings along with it.  For although few men will avow their\\ndesires of being immortal, upon such hard conditions, yet in the two\\nkingdoms before mentioned, of Balnibarbi and Japan, he observed that\\nevery man desired to put off death some time longer, let it approach ever\\nso late: and he rarely heard of any man who died willingly, except he\\nwere incited by the extremity of grief or torture.  And he appealed to\\nme, whether in those countries I had travelled, as well as my own, I had\\nnot observed the same general disposition.”\\n\\nAfter this preface, he gave me a particular account of the _struldbrugs_\\namong them.  He said, “they commonly acted like mortals till about thirty\\nyears old; after which, by degrees, they grew melancholy and dejected,\\nincreasing in both till they came to fourscore.  This he learned from\\ntheir own confession: for otherwise, there not being above two or three\\nof that species born in an age, they were too few to form a general\\nobservation by.  When they came to fourscore years, which is reckoned the\\nextremity of living in this country, they had not only all the follies\\nand infirmities of other old men, but many more which arose from the\\ndreadful prospect of never dying.  They were not only opinionative,\\npeevish, covetous, morose, vain, talkative, but incapable of friendship,\\nand dead to all natural affection, which never descended below their\\ngrandchildren.  Envy and impotent desires are their prevailing passions.\\nBut those objects against which their envy seems principally directed,\\nare the vices of the younger sort and the deaths of the old.  By\\nreflecting on the former, they find themselves cut off from all\\npossibility of pleasure; and whenever they see a funeral, they lament and\\nrepine that others have gone to a harbour of rest to which they\\nthemselves never can hope to arrive.  They have no remembrance of\\nanything but what they learned and observed in their youth and\\nmiddle-age, and even that is very imperfect; and for the truth or\\nparticulars of any fact, it is safer to depend on common tradition, than\\nupon their best recollections.  The least miserable among them appear to\\nbe those who turn to dotage, and entirely lose their memories; these meet\\nwith more pity and assistance, because they want many bad qualities which\\nabound in others.\\n\\n“If a _struldbrug_ happen to marry one of his own kind, the marriage is\\ndissolved of course, by the courtesy of the kingdom, as soon as the\\nyounger of the two comes to be fourscore; for the law thinks it a\\nreasonable indulgence, that those who are condemned, without any fault of\\ntheir own, to a perpetual continuance in the world, should not have their\\nmisery doubled by the load of a wife.\\n\\n“As soon as they have completed the term of eighty years, they are looked\\non as dead in law; their heirs immediately succeed to their estates; only\\na small pittance is reserved for their support; and the poor ones are\\nmaintained at the public charge.  After that period, they are held\\nincapable of any employment of trust or profit; they cannot purchase\\nlands, or take leases; neither are they allowed to be witnesses in any\\ncause, either civil or criminal, not even for the decision of meers and\\nbounds.\\n\\n“At ninety, they lose their teeth and hair; they have at that age no\\ndistinction of taste, but eat and drink whatever they can get, without\\nrelish or appetite.  The diseases they were subject to still continue,\\nwithout increasing or diminishing.  In talking, they forget the common\\nappellation of things, and the names of persons, even of those who are\\ntheir nearest friends and relations.  For the same reason, they never can\\namuse themselves with reading, because their memory will not serve to\\ncarry them from the beginning of a sentence to the end; and by this\\ndefect, they are deprived of the only entertainment whereof they might\\notherwise be capable.\\n\\n“The language of this country being always upon the flux, the\\n_struldbrugs_ of one age do not understand those of another; neither are\\nthey able, after two hundred years, to hold any conversation (farther\\nthan by a few general words) with their neighbours the mortals; and thus\\nthey lie under the disadvantage of living like foreigners in their own\\ncountry.”\\n\\nThis was the account given me of the _struldbrugs_, as near as I can\\nremember.  I afterwards saw five or six of different ages, the youngest\\nnot above two hundred years old, who were brought to me at several times\\nby some of my friends; but although they were told, “that I was a great\\ntraveller, and had seen all the world,” they had not the least curiosity\\nto ask me a question; only desired “I would give them _slumskudask_,” or\\na token of remembrance; which is a modest way of begging, to avoid the\\nlaw, that strictly forbids it, because they are provided for by the\\npublic, although indeed with a very scanty allowance.\\n\\nThey are despised and hated by all sorts of people.  When one of them is\\nborn, it is reckoned ominous, and their birth is recorded very\\nparticularly so that you may know their age by consulting the register,\\nwhich, however, has not been kept above a thousand years past, or at\\nleast has been destroyed by time or public disturbances.  But the usual\\nway of computing how old they are, is by asking them what kings or great\\npersons they can remember, and then consulting history; for infallibly\\nthe last prince in their mind did not begin his reign after they were\\nfourscore years old.\\n\\nThey were the most mortifying sight I ever beheld; and the women more\\nhorrible than the men.  Besides the usual deformities in extreme old age,\\nthey acquired an additional ghastliness, in proportion to their number of\\nyears, which is not to be described; and among half a dozen, I soon\\ndistinguished which was the eldest, although there was not above a\\ncentury or two between them.\\n\\nThe reader will easily believe, that from what I had hear and seen, my\\nkeen appetite for perpetuity of life was much abated.  I grew heartily\\nashamed of the pleasing visions I had formed; and thought no tyrant could\\ninvent a death into which I would not run with pleasure, from such a\\nlife.  The king heard of all that had passed between me and my friends\\nupon this occasion, and rallied me very pleasantly; wishing I could send\\na couple of _struldbrugs_ to my own country, to arm our people against\\nthe fear of death; but this, it seems, is forbidden by the fundamental\\nlaws of the kingdom, or else I should have been well content with the\\ntrouble and expense of transporting them.\\n\\nI could not but agree, that the laws of this kingdom relative to the\\n_struldbrugs_ were founded upon the strongest reasons, and such as any\\nother country would be under the necessity of enacting, in the like\\ncircumstances.  Otherwise, as avarice is the necessary consequence of old\\nage, those immortals would in time become proprietors of the whole\\nnation, and engross the civil power, which, for want of abilities to\\nmanage, must end in the ruin of the public.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\n\\nThe author leaves Luggnagg, and sails to Japan.  From thence he returns\\nin a Dutch ship to Amsterdam, and from Amsterdam to England.\\n\\nI thought this account of the _struldbrugs_ might be some entertainment\\nto the reader, because it seems to be a little out of the common way; at\\nleast I do not remember to have met the like in any book of travels that\\nhas come to my hands: and if I am deceived, my excuse must be, that it is\\nnecessary for travellers who describe the same country, very often to\\nagree in dwelling on the same particulars, without deserving the censure\\nof having borrowed or transcribed from those who wrote before them.\\n\\nThere is indeed a perpetual commerce between this kingdom and the great\\nempire of Japan; and it is very probable, that the Japanese authors may\\nhave given some account of the _struldbrugs_; but my stay in Japan was so\\nshort, and I was so entirely a stranger to the language, that I was not\\nqualified to make any inquiries.  But I hope the Dutch, upon this notice,\\nwill be curious and able enough to supply my defects.\\n\\nHis majesty having often pressed me to accept some employment in his\\ncourt, and finding me absolutely determined to return to my native\\ncountry, was pleased to give me his license to depart; and honoured me\\nwith a letter of recommendation, under his own hand, to the Emperor of\\nJapan.  He likewise presented me with four hundred and forty-four large\\npieces of gold (this nation delighting in even numbers), and a red\\ndiamond, which I sold in England for eleven hundred pounds.\\n\\nOn the 6th of May, 1709, I took a solemn leave of his majesty, and all my\\nfriends.  This prince was so gracious as to order a guard to conduct me\\nto Glanguenstald, which is a royal port to the south-west part of the\\nisland.  In six days I found a vessel ready to carry me to Japan, and\\nspent fifteen days in the voyage.  We landed at a small port-town called\\nXamoschi, situated on the south-east part of Japan; the town lies on the\\nwestern point, where there is a narrow strait leading northward into\\nalong arm of the sea, upon the north-west part of which, Yedo, the\\nmetropolis, stands.  At landing, I showed the custom-house officers my\\nletter from the king of Luggnagg to his imperial majesty.  They knew the\\nseal perfectly well; it was as broad as the palm of my hand.  The\\nimpression was, _A king lifting up a lame beggar from the earth_.  The\\nmagistrates of the town, hearing of my letter, received me as a public\\nminister.  They provided me with carriages and servants, and bore my\\ncharges to Yedo; where I was admitted to an audience, and delivered my\\nletter, which was opened with great ceremony, and explained to the\\nEmperor by an interpreter, who then gave me notice, by his majesty’s\\norder, “that I should signify my request, and, whatever it were, it\\nshould be granted, for the sake of his royal brother of Luggnagg.”  This\\ninterpreter was a person employed to transact affairs with the\\nHollanders.  He soon conjectured, by my countenance, that I was a\\nEuropean, and therefore repeated his majesty’s commands in Low Dutch,\\nwhich he spoke perfectly well.  I answered, as I had before determined,\\n“that I was a Dutch merchant, shipwrecked in a very remote country,\\nwhence I had travelled by sea and land to Luggnagg, and then took\\nshipping for Japan; where I knew my countrymen often traded, and with\\nsome of these I hoped to get an opportunity of returning into Europe: I\\ntherefore most humbly entreated his royal favour, to give order that I\\nshould be conducted in safety to Nangasac.”  To this I added another\\npetition, “that for the sake of my patron the king of Luggnagg, his\\nmajesty would condescend to excuse my performing the ceremony imposed on\\nmy countrymen, of trampling upon the crucifix: because I had been thrown\\ninto his kingdom by my misfortunes, without any intention of trading.”\\nWhen this latter petition was interpreted to the Emperor, he seemed a\\nlittle surprised; and said, “he believed I was the first of my countrymen\\nwho ever made any scruple in this point; and that he began to doubt,\\nwhether I was a real Hollander, or not; but rather suspected I must be a\\nChristian.  However, for the reasons I had offered, but chiefly to\\ngratify the king of Luggnagg by an uncommon mark of his favour, he would\\ncomply with the singularity of my humour; but the affair must be managed\\nwith dexterity, and his officers should be commanded to let me pass, as\\nit were by forgetfulness.  For he assured me, that if the secret should\\nbe discovered by my countrymen the Dutch, they would cut my throat in the\\nvoyage.”  I returned my thanks, by the interpreter, for so unusual a\\nfavour; and some troops being at that time on their march to Nangasac,\\nthe commanding officer had orders to convey me safe thither, with\\nparticular instructions about the business of the crucifix.\\n\\nOn the 9th day of June, 1709, I arrived at Nangasac, after a very long\\nand troublesome journey.  I soon fell into the company of some Dutch\\nsailors belonging to the Amboyna, of Amsterdam, a stout ship of 450 tons.\\nI had lived long in Holland, pursuing my studies at Leyden, and I spoke\\nDutch well.  The seamen soon knew whence I came last: they were curious\\nto inquire into my voyages and course of life.  I made up a story as\\nshort and probable as I could, but concealed the greatest part.  I knew\\nmany persons in Holland.  I was able to invent names for my parents, whom\\nI pretended to be obscure people in the province of Gelderland.  I would\\nhave given the captain (one Theodorus Vangrult) what he pleased to ask\\nfor my voyage to Holland; but understanding I was a surgeon, he was\\ncontented to take half the usual rate, on condition that I would serve\\nhim in the way of my calling.  Before we took shipping, I was often asked\\nby some of the crew, whether I had performed the ceremony above\\nmentioned?  I evaded the question by general answers; “that I had\\nsatisfied the Emperor and court in all particulars.”  However, a\\nmalicious rogue of a skipper went to an officer, and pointing to me, told\\nhim, “I had not yet trampled on the crucifix;” but the other, who had\\nreceived instructions to let me pass, gave the rascal twenty strokes on\\nthe shoulders with a bamboo; after which I was no more troubled with such\\nquestions.\\n\\nNothing happened worth mentioning in this voyage.  We sailed with a fair\\nwind to the Cape of Good Hope, where we staid only to take in fresh\\nwater.  On the 10th of April, 1710, we arrived safe at Amsterdam, having\\nlost only three men by sickness in the voyage, and a fourth, who fell\\nfrom the foremast into the sea, not far from the coast of Guinea.  From\\nAmsterdam I soon after set sail for England, in a small vessel belonging\\nto that city.\\n\\nOn the 16th of April we put in at the Downs.  I landed next morning, and\\nsaw once more my native country, after an absence of five years and six\\nmonths complete.  I went straight to Redriff, where I arrived the same\\nday at two in the afternoon, and found my wife and family in good health.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART IV.  A VOYAGE TO THE COUNTRY OF THE HOUYHNHNMS.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\n\\n\\nThe author sets out as captain of a ship.  His men conspire against him,\\nconfine him a long time to his cabin, and set him on shore in an unknown\\nland.  He travels up into the country.  The Yahoos, a strange sort of\\nanimal, described.  The author meets two Houyhnhnms.\\n\\nI continued at home with my wife and children about five months, in a\\nvery happy condition, if I could have learned the lesson of knowing when\\nI was well.  I left my poor wife big with child, and accepted an\\nadvantageous offer made me to be captain of the Adventurer, a stout\\nmerchantman of 350 tons: for I understood navigation well, and being\\ngrown weary of a surgeon’s employment at sea, which, however, I could\\nexercise upon occasion, I took a skilful young man of that calling, one\\nRobert Purefoy, into my ship.  We set sail from Portsmouth upon the 7th\\nday of September, 1710; on the 14th we met with Captain Pocock, of\\nBristol, at Teneriffe, who was going to the bay of Campechy to cut\\nlogwood.  On the 16th, he was parted from us by a storm; I heard since my\\nreturn, that his ship foundered, and none escaped but one cabin boy.  He\\nwas an honest man, and a good sailor, but a little too positive in his\\nown opinions, which was the cause of his destruction, as it has been with\\nseveral others; for if he had followed my advice, he might have been safe\\nat home with his family at this time, as well as myself.\\n\\nI had several men who died in my ship of calentures, so that I was forced\\nto get recruits out of Barbadoes and the Leeward Islands, where I\\ntouched, by the direction of the merchants who employed me; which I had\\nsoon too much cause to repent: for I found afterwards, that most of them\\nhad been buccaneers.  I had fifty hands onboard; and my orders were, that\\nI should trade with the Indians in the South-Sea, and make what\\ndiscoveries I could.  These rogues, whom I had picked up, debauched my\\nother men, and they all formed a conspiracy to seize the ship, and secure\\nme; which they did one morning, rushing into my cabin, and binding me\\nhand and foot, threatening to throw me overboard, if I offered to stir.\\nI told them, “I was their prisoner, and would submit.”  This they made me\\nswear to do, and then they unbound me, only fastening one of my legs with\\na chain, near my bed, and placed a sentry at my door with his piece\\ncharged, who was commanded to shoot me dead if I attempted my liberty.\\nThey sent me own victuals and drink, and took the government of the ship\\nto themselves.  Their design was to turn pirates and, plunder the\\nSpaniards, which they could not do till they got more men.  But first\\nthey resolved to sell the goods the ship, and then go to Madagascar for\\nrecruits, several among them having died since my confinement.  They\\nsailed many weeks, and traded with the Indians; but I knew not what\\ncourse they took, being kept a close prisoner in my cabin, and expecting\\nnothing less than to be murdered, as they often threatened me.\\n\\nUpon the 9th day of May, 1711, one James Welch came down to my cabin, and\\nsaid, “he had orders from the captain to set me ashore.”  I expostulated\\nwith him, but in vain; neither would he so much as tell me who their new\\ncaptain was.  They forced me into the long-boat, letting me put on my\\nbest suit of clothes, which were as good as new, and take a small bundle\\nof linen, but no arms, except my hanger; and they were so civil as not to\\nsearch my pockets, into which I conveyed what money I had, with some\\nother little necessaries.  They rowed about a league, and then set me\\ndown on a strand.  I desired them to tell me what country it was.  They\\nall swore, “they knew no more than myself;” but said, “that the captain”\\n(as they called him) “was resolved, after they had sold the lading, to\\nget rid of me in the first place where they could discover land.”  They\\npushed off immediately, advising me to make haste for fear of being\\novertaken by the tide, and so bade me farewell.\\n\\nIn this desolate condition I advanced forward, and soon got upon firm\\nground, where I sat down on a bank to rest myself, and consider what I\\nhad best do.  When I was a little refreshed, I went up into the country,\\nresolving to deliver myself to the first savages I should meet, and\\npurchase my life from them by some bracelets, glass rings, and other\\ntoys, which sailors usually provide themselves with in those voyages, and\\nwhereof I had some about me.  The land was divided by long rows of trees,\\nnot regularly planted, but naturally growing; there was great plenty of\\ngrass, and several fields of oats.  I walked very circumspectly, for fear\\nof being surprised, or suddenly shot with an arrow from behind, or on\\neither side.  I fell into a beaten road, where I saw many tracts of human\\nfeet, and some of cows, but most of horses.  At last I beheld several\\nanimals in a field, and one or two of the same kind sitting in trees.\\nTheir shape was very singular and deformed, which a little discomposed\\nme, so that I lay down behind a thicket to observe them better.  Some of\\nthem coming forward near the place where I lay, gave me an opportunity of\\ndistinctly marking their form.  Their heads and breasts were covered with\\na thick hair, some frizzled, and others lank; they had beards like goats,\\nand a long ridge of hair down their backs, and the fore parts of their\\nlegs and feet; but the rest of their bodies was bare, so that I might see\\ntheir skins, which were of a brown buff colour.  They had no tails, nor\\nany hair at all on their buttocks, except about the anus, which, I\\npresume, nature had placed there to defend them as they sat on the\\nground, for this posture they used, as well as lying down, and often\\nstood on their hind feet.  They climbed high trees as nimbly as a\\nsquirrel, for they had strong extended claws before and behind,\\nterminating in sharp points, and hooked.  They would often spring, and\\nbound, and leap, with prodigious agility.  The females were not so large\\nas the males; they had long lank hair on their heads, but none on their\\nfaces, nor any thing more than a sort of down on the rest of their\\nbodies, except about the anus and pudenda.  The dugs hung between their\\nfore feet, and often reached almost to the ground as they walked.  The\\nhair of both sexes was of several colours, brown, red, black, and yellow.\\nUpon the whole, I never beheld, in all my travels, so disagreeable an\\nanimal, or one against which I naturally conceived so strong an\\nantipathy.  So that, thinking I had seen enough, full of contempt and\\naversion, I got up, and pursued the beaten road, hoping it might direct\\nme to the cabin of some Indian.  I had not got far, when I met one of\\nthese creatures full in my way, and coming up directly to me.  The ugly\\nmonster, when he saw me, distorted several ways, every feature of his\\nvisage, and stared, as at an object he had never seen before; then\\napproaching nearer, lifted up his fore-paw, whether out of curiosity or\\nmischief I could not tell; but I drew my hanger, and gave him a good blow\\nwith the flat side of it, for I durst not strike with the edge, fearing\\nthe inhabitants might be provoked against me, if they should come to know\\nthat I had killed or maimed any of their cattle.  When the beast felt the\\nsmart, he drew back, and roared so loud, that a herd of at least forty\\ncame flocking about me from the next field, howling and making odious\\nfaces; but I ran to the body of a tree, and leaning my back against it,\\nkept them off by waving my hanger.  Several of this cursed brood, getting\\nhold of the branches behind, leaped up into the tree, whence they began\\nto discharge their excrements on my head; however, I escaped pretty well\\nby sticking close to the stem of the tree, but was almost stifled with\\nthe filth, which fell about me on every side.\\n\\nIn the midst of this distress, I observed them all to run away on a\\nsudden as fast as they could; at which I ventured to leave the tree and\\npursue the road, wondering what it was that could put them into this\\nfright.  But looking on my left hand, I saw a horse walking softly in the\\nfield; which my persecutors having sooner discovered, was the cause of\\ntheir flight.  The horse started a little, when he came near me, but soon\\nrecovering himself, looked full in my face with manifest tokens of\\nwonder; he viewed my hands and feet, walking round me several times.  I\\nwould have pursued my journey, but he placed himself directly in the way,\\nyet looking with a very mild aspect, never offering the least violence.\\nWe stood gazing at each other for some time; at last I took the boldness\\nto reach my hand towards his neck with a design to stroke it, using the\\ncommon style and whistle of jockeys, when they are going to handle a\\nstrange horse.  But this animal seemed to receive my civilities with\\ndisdain, shook his head, and bent his brows, softly raising up his right\\nfore-foot to remove my hand.  Then he neighed three or four times, but in\\nso different a cadence, that I almost began to think he was speaking to\\nhimself, in some language of his own.\\n\\nWhile he and I were thus employed, another horse came up; who applying\\nhimself to the first in a very formal manner, they gently struck each\\nother’s right hoof before, neighing several times by turns, and varying\\nthe sound, which seemed to be almost articulate.  They went some paces\\noff, as if it were to confer together, walking side by side, backward and\\nforward, like persons deliberating upon some affair of weight, but often\\nturning their eyes towards me, as it were to watch that I might not\\nescape.  I was amazed to see such actions and behaviour in brute beasts;\\nand concluded with myself, that if the inhabitants of this country were\\nendued with a proportionable degree of reason, they must needs be the\\nwisest people upon earth.  This thought gave me so much comfort, that I\\nresolved to go forward, until I could discover some house or village, or\\nmeet with any of the natives, leaving the two horses to discourse\\ntogether as they pleased.  But the first, who was a dapple gray,\\nobserving me to steal off, neighed after me in so expressive a tone, that\\nI fancied myself to understand what he meant; whereupon I turned back,\\nand came near to him to expect his farther commands: but concealing my\\nfear as much as I could, for I began to be in some pain how this\\nadventure might terminate; and the reader will easily believe I did not\\nmuch like my present situation.\\n\\nThe two horses came up close to me, looking with great earnestness upon\\nmy face and hands.  The gray steed rubbed my hat all round with his right\\nfore-hoof, and discomposed it so much that I was forced to adjust it\\nbetter by taking it off and settling it again; whereat, both he and his\\ncompanion (who was a brown bay) appeared to be much surprised: the latter\\nfelt the lappet of my coat, and finding it to hang loose about me, they\\nboth looked with new signs of wonder.  He stroked my right hand, seeming\\nto admire the softness and colour; but he squeezed it so hard between his\\nhoof and his pastern, that I was forced to roar; after which they both\\ntouched me with all possible tenderness.  They were under great\\nperplexity about my shoes and stockings, which they felt very often,\\nneighing to each other, and using various gestures, not unlike those of a\\nphilosopher, when he would attempt to solve some new and difficult\\nphenomenon.\\n\\nUpon the whole, the behaviour of these animals was so orderly and\\nrational, so acute and judicious, that I at last concluded they must\\nneeds be magicians, who had thus metamorphosed themselves upon some\\ndesign, and seeing a stranger in the way, resolved to divert themselves\\nwith him; or, perhaps, were really amazed at the sight of a man so very\\ndifferent in habit, feature, and complexion, from those who might\\nprobably live in so remote a climate.  Upon the strength of this\\nreasoning, I ventured to address them in the following manner:\\n“Gentlemen, if you be conjurers, as I have good cause to believe, you can\\nunderstand my language; therefore I make bold to let your worships know\\nthat I am a poor distressed Englishman, driven by his misfortunes upon\\nyour coast; and I entreat one of you to let me ride upon his back, as if\\nhe were a real horse, to some house or village where I can be relieved.\\nIn return of which favour, I will make you a present of this knife and\\nbracelet,” taking them out of my pocket.  The two creatures stood silent\\nwhile I spoke, seeming to listen with great attention, and when I had\\nended, they neighed frequently towards each other, as if they were\\nengaged in serious conversation.  I plainly observed that their language\\nexpressed the passions very well, and the words might, with little pains,\\nbe resolved into an alphabet more easily than the Chinese.\\n\\nI could frequently distinguish the word _Yahoo_, which was repeated by\\neach of them several times: and although it was impossible for me to\\nconjecture what it meant, yet while the two horses were busy in\\nconversation, I endeavoured to practise this word upon my tongue; and as\\nsoon as they were silent, I boldly pronounced _Yahoo_ in a loud voice,\\nimitating at the same time, as near as I could, the neighing of a horse;\\nat which they were both visibly surprised; and the gray repeated the same\\nword twice, as if he meant to teach me the right accent; wherein I spoke\\nafter him as well as I could, and found myself perceivably to improve\\nevery time, though very far from any degree of perfection.  Then the bay\\ntried me with a second word, much harder to be pronounced; but reducing\\nit to the English orthography, may be spelt thus, _Houyhnhnm_.  I did not\\nsucceed in this so well as in the former; but after two or three farther\\ntrials, I had better fortune; and they both appeared amazed at my\\ncapacity.\\n\\nAfter some further discourse, which I then conjectured might relate to\\nme, the two friends took their leaves, with the same compliment of\\nstriking each other’s hoof; and the gray made me signs that I should walk\\nbefore him; wherein I thought it prudent to comply, till I could find a\\nbetter director.  When I offered to slacken my pace, he would cry _hhuun\\nhhuun_: I guessed his meaning, and gave him to understand, as well as I\\ncould, “that I was weary, and not able to walk faster;” upon which he\\nwould stand awhile to let me rest.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\n\\nThe author conducted by a Houyhnhnm to his house.  The house described.\\nThe author’s reception.  The food of the Houyhnhnms.  The author in\\ndistress for want of meat.  Is at last relieved.  His manner of feeding\\nin this country.\\n\\nHaving travelled about three miles, we came to a long kind of building,\\nmade of timber stuck in the ground, and wattled across; the roof was low\\nand covered with straw.  I now began to be a little comforted; and took\\nout some toys, which travellers usually carry for presents to the savage\\nIndians of America, and other parts, in hopes the people of the house\\nwould be thereby encouraged to receive me kindly.  The horse made me a\\nsign to go in first; it was a large room with a smooth clay floor, and a\\nrack and manger, extending the whole length on one side.  There were\\nthree nags and two mares, not eating, but some of them sitting down upon\\ntheir hams, which I very much wondered at; but wondered more to see the\\nrest employed in domestic business; these seemed but ordinary cattle.\\nHowever, this confirmed my first opinion, that a people who could so far\\ncivilise brute animals, must needs excel in wisdom all the nations of the\\nworld.  The gray came in just after, and thereby prevented any ill\\ntreatment which the others might have given me.  He neighed to them\\nseveral times in a style of authority, and received answers.\\n\\nBeyond this room there were three others, reaching the length of the\\nhouse, to which you passed through three doors, opposite to each other,\\nin the manner of a vista.  We went through the second room towards the\\nthird.  Here the gray walked in first, beckoning me to attend: I waited\\nin the second room, and got ready my presents for the master and mistress\\nof the house; they were two knives, three bracelets of false pearls, a\\nsmall looking-glass, and a bead necklace.  The horse neighed three or\\nfour times, and I waited to hear some answers in a human voice, but I\\nheard no other returns than in the same dialect, only one or two a little\\nshriller than his.  I began to think that this house must belong to some\\nperson of great note among them, because there appeared so much ceremony\\nbefore I could gain admittance.  But, that a man of quality should be\\nserved all by horses, was beyond my comprehension.  I feared my brain was\\ndisturbed by my sufferings and misfortunes.  I roused myself, and looked\\nabout me in the room where I was left alone: this was furnished like the\\nfirst, only after a more elegant manner.  I rubbed my eyes often, but the\\nsame objects still occurred.  I pinched my arms and sides to awake\\nmyself, hoping I might be in a dream.  I then absolutely concluded, that\\nall these appearances could be nothing else but necromancy and magic.\\nBut I had no time to pursue these reflections; for the gray horse came to\\nthe door, and made me a sign to follow him into the third room where I\\nsaw a very comely mare, together with a colt and foal, sitting on their\\nhaunches upon mats of straw, not unartfully made, and perfectly neat and\\nclean.\\n\\nThe mare soon after my entrance rose from her mat, and coming up close,\\nafter having nicely observed my hands and face, gave me a most\\ncontemptuous look; and turning to the horse, I heard the word _Yahoo_\\noften repeated betwixt them; the meaning of which word I could not then\\ncomprehend, although it was the first I had learned to pronounce.  But I\\nwas soon better informed, to my everlasting mortification; for the horse,\\nbeckoning to me with his head, and repeating the _hhuun_, _hhuun_, as he\\ndid upon the road, which I understood was to attend him, led me out into\\na kind of court, where was another building, at some distance from the\\nhouse.  Here we entered, and I saw three of those detestable creatures,\\nwhich I first met after my landing, feeding upon roots, and the flesh of\\nsome animals, which I afterwards found to be that of asses and dogs, and\\nnow and then a cow, dead by accident or disease.  They were all tied by\\nthe neck with strong withes fastened to a beam; they held their food\\nbetween the claws of their fore feet, and tore it with their teeth.\\n\\nThe master horse ordered a sorrel nag, one of his servants, to untie the\\nlargest of these animals, and take him into the yard.  The beast and I\\nwere brought close together, and by our countenances diligently compared\\nboth by master and servant, who thereupon repeated several times the word\\n_Yahoo_.  My horror and astonishment are not to be described, when I\\nobserved in this abominable animal, a perfect human figure: the face of\\nit indeed was flat and broad, the nose depressed, the lips large, and the\\nmouth wide; but these differences are common to all savage nations, where\\nthe lineaments of the countenance are distorted, by the natives suffering\\ntheir infants to lie grovelling on the earth, or by carrying them on\\ntheir backs, nuzzling with their face against the mothers’ shoulders.\\nThe fore-feet of the _Yahoo_ differed from my hands in nothing else but\\nthe length of the nails, the coarseness and brownness of the palms, and\\nthe hairiness on the backs.  There was the same resemblance between our\\nfeet, with the same differences; which I knew very well, though the\\nhorses did not, because of my shoes and stockings; the same in every part\\nof our bodies except as to hairiness and colour, which I have already\\ndescribed.\\n\\nThe great difficulty that seemed to stick with the two horses, was to see\\nthe rest of my body so very different from that of a _Yahoo_, for which I\\nwas obliged to my clothes, whereof they had no conception.  The sorrel\\nnag offered me a root, which he held (after their manner, as we shall\\ndescribe in its proper place) between his hoof and pastern; I took it in\\nmy hand, and, having smelt it, returned it to him again as civilly as I\\ncould.  He brought out of the _Yahoos_’ kennel a piece of ass’s flesh;\\nbut it smelt so offensively that I turned from it with loathing: he then\\nthrew it to the _Yahoo_, by whom it was greedily devoured.  He afterwards\\nshowed me a wisp of hay, and a fetlock full of oats; but I shook my head,\\nto signify that neither of these were food for me.  And indeed I now\\napprehended that I must absolutely starve, if I did not get to some of my\\nown species; for as to those filthy _Yahoos_, although there were few\\ngreater lovers of mankind at that time than myself, yet I confess I never\\nsaw any sensitive being so detestable on all accounts; and the more I\\ncame near them the more hateful they grew, while I stayed in that\\ncountry.  This the master horse observed by my behaviour, and therefore\\nsent the _Yahoo_ back to his kennel.  He then put his fore-hoof to his\\nmouth, at which I was much surprised, although he did it with ease, and\\nwith a motion that appeared perfectly natural, and made other signs, to\\nknow what I would eat; but I could not return him such an answer as he\\nwas able to apprehend; and if he had understood me, I did not see how it\\nwas possible to contrive any way for finding myself nourishment.  While\\nwe were thus engaged, I observed a cow passing by, whereupon I pointed to\\nher, and expressed a desire to go and milk her.  This had its effect; for\\nhe led me back into the house, and ordered a mare-servant to open a room,\\nwhere a good store of milk lay in earthen and wooden vessels, after a\\nvery orderly and cleanly manner.  She gave me a large bowlful, of which I\\ndrank very heartily, and found myself well refreshed.\\n\\nAbout noon, I saw coming towards the house a kind of vehicle drawn like a\\nsledge by four _Yahoos_.  There was in it an old steed, who seemed to be\\nof quality; he alighted with his hind-feet forward, having by accident\\ngot a hurt in his left fore-foot.  He came to dine with our horse, who\\nreceived him with great civility.  They dined in the best room, and had\\noats boiled in milk for the second course, which the old horse ate warm,\\nbut the rest cold.  Their mangers were placed circular in the middle of\\nthe room, and divided into several partitions, round which they sat on\\ntheir haunches, upon bosses of straw.  In the middle was a large rack,\\nwith angles answering to every partition of the manger; so that each\\nhorse and mare ate their own hay, and their own mash of oats and milk,\\nwith much decency and regularity.  The behaviour of the young colt and\\nfoal appeared very modest, and that of the master and mistress extremely\\ncheerful and complaisant to their guest.  The gray ordered me to stand by\\nhim; and much discourse passed between him and his friend concerning me,\\nas I found by the stranger’s often looking on me, and the frequent\\nrepetition of the word _Yahoo_.\\n\\nI happened to wear my gloves, which the master gray observing, seemed\\nperplexed, discovering signs of wonder what I had done to my fore-feet.\\nHe put his hoof three or four times to them, as if he would signify, that\\nI should reduce them to their former shape, which I presently did,\\npulling off both my gloves, and putting them into my pocket.  This\\noccasioned farther talk; and I saw the company was pleased with my\\nbehaviour, whereof I soon found the good effects.  I was ordered to speak\\nthe few words I understood; and while they were at dinner, the master\\ntaught me the names for oats, milk, fire, water, and some others, which I\\ncould readily pronounce after him, having from my youth a great facility\\nin learning languages.\\n\\nWhen dinner was done, the master horse took me aside, and by signs and\\nwords made me understand the concern he was in that I had nothing to eat.\\nOats in their tongue are called _hlunnh_.  This word I pronounced two or\\nthree times; for although I had refused them at first, yet, upon second\\nthoughts, I considered that I could contrive to make of them a kind of\\nbread, which might be sufficient, with milk, to keep me alive, till I\\ncould make my escape to some other country, and to creatures of my own\\nspecies.  The horse immediately ordered a white mare servant of his\\nfamily to bring me a good quantity of oats in a sort of wooden tray.\\nThese I heated before the fire, as well as I could, and rubbed them till\\nthe husks came off, which I made a shift to winnow from the grain.  I\\nground and beat them between two stones; then took water, and made them\\ninto a paste or cake, which I toasted at the fire and eat warm with milk.\\nIt was at first a very insipid diet, though common enough in many parts\\nof Europe, but grew tolerable by time; and having been often reduced to\\nhard fare in my life, this was not the first experiment I had made how\\neasily nature is satisfied.  And I cannot but observe, that I never had\\none hours sickness while I stayed in this island.  It is true, I\\nsometimes made a shift to catch a rabbit, or bird, by springs made of\\n_Yahoo’s_ hairs; and I often gathered wholesome herbs, which I boiled,\\nand ate as salads with my bread; and now and then, for a rarity, I made a\\nlittle butter, and drank the whey.  I was at first at a great loss for\\nsalt, but custom soon reconciled me to the want of it; and I am confident\\nthat the frequent use of salt among us is an effect of luxury, and was\\nfirst introduced only as a provocative to drink, except where it is\\nnecessary for preserving flesh in long voyages, or in places remote from\\ngreat markets; for we observe no animal to be fond of it but man, and as\\nto myself, when I left this country, it was a great while before I could\\nendure the taste of it in anything that I ate.\\n\\nThis is enough to say upon the subject of my diet, wherewith other\\ntravellers fill their books, as if the readers were personally concerned\\nwhether we fare well or ill.  However, it was necessary to mention this\\nmatter, lest the world should think it impossible that I could find\\nsustenance for three years in such a country, and among such inhabitants.\\n\\nWhen it grew towards evening, the master horse ordered a place for me to\\nlodge in; it was but six yards from the house and separated from the\\nstable of the _Yahoos_.  Here I got some straw, and covering myself with\\nmy own clothes, slept very sound.  But I was in a short time better\\naccommodated, as the reader shall know hereafter, when I come to treat\\nmore particularly about my way of living.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\n\\nThe author studies to learn the language.  The Houyhnhnm, his master,\\nassists in teaching him.  The language described.  Several Houyhnhnms of\\nquality come out of curiosity to see the author.  He gives his master a\\nshort account of his voyage.\\n\\nMy principal endeavour was to learn the language, which my master (for so\\nI shall henceforth call him), and his children, and every servant of his\\nhouse, were desirous to teach me; for they looked upon it as a prodigy,\\nthat a brute animal should discover such marks of a rational creature.  I\\npointed to every thing, and inquired the name of it, which I wrote down\\nin my journal-book when I was alone, and corrected my bad accent by\\ndesiring those of the family to pronounce it often.  In this employment,\\na sorrel nag, one of the under-servants, was very ready to assist me.\\n\\nIn speaking, they pronounced through the nose and throat, and their\\nlanguage approaches nearest to the High-Dutch, or German, of any I know\\nin Europe; but is much more graceful and significant.  The emperor\\nCharles V. made almost the same observation, when he said “that if he\\nwere to speak to his horse, it should be in High-Dutch.”\\n\\nThe curiosity and impatience of my master were so great, that he spent\\nmany hours of his leisure to instruct me.  He was convinced (as he\\nafterwards told me) that I must be a _Yahoo_; but my teachableness,\\ncivility, and cleanliness, astonished him; which were qualities\\naltogether opposite to those animals.  He was most perplexed about my\\nclothes, reasoning sometimes with himself, whether they were a part of my\\nbody: for I never pulled them off till the family were asleep, and got\\nthem on before they waked in the morning.  My master was eager to learn\\n“whence I came; how I acquired those appearances of reason, which I\\ndiscovered in all my actions; and to know my story from my own mouth,\\nwhich he hoped he should soon do by the great proficiency I made in\\nlearning and pronouncing their words and sentences.”  To help my memory,\\nI formed all I learned into the English alphabet, and writ the words\\ndown, with the translations.  This last, after some time, I ventured to\\ndo in my master’s presence.  It cost me much trouble to explain to him\\nwhat I was doing; for the inhabitants have not the least idea of books or\\nliterature.\\n\\nIn about ten weeks time, I was able to understand most of his questions;\\nand in three months, could give him some tolerable answers.  He was\\nextremely curious to know “from what part of the country I came, and how\\nI was taught to imitate a rational creature; because the _Yahoos_ (whom\\nhe saw I exactly resembled in my head, hands, and face, that were only\\nvisible), with some appearance of cunning, and the strongest disposition\\nto mischief, were observed to be the most unteachable of all brutes.”  I\\nanswered, “that I came over the sea, from a far place, with many others\\nof my own kind, in a great hollow vessel made of the bodies of trees:\\nthat my companions forced me to land on this coast, and then left me to\\nshift for myself.”  It was with some difficulty, and by the help of many\\nsigns, that I brought him to understand me.  He replied, “that I must\\nneeds be mistaken, or that I said the thing which was not;” for they have\\nno word in their language to express lying or falsehood.  “He knew it was\\nimpossible that there could be a country beyond the sea, or that a parcel\\nof brutes could move a wooden vessel whither they pleased upon water.  He\\nwas sure no _Houyhnhnm_ alive could make such a vessel, nor would trust\\n_Yahoos_ to manage it.”\\n\\nThe word _Houyhnhnm_, in their tongue, signifies a _horse_, and, in its\\netymology, the _perfection of nature_.  I told my master, “that I was at\\na loss for expression, but would improve as fast as I could; and hoped,\\nin a short time, I should be able to tell him wonders.”  He was pleased\\nto direct his own mare, his colt, and foal, and the servants of the\\nfamily, to take all opportunities of instructing me; and every day, for\\ntwo or three hours, he was at the same pains himself.  Several horses and\\nmares of quality in the neighbourhood came often to our house, upon the\\nreport spread of “a wonderful _Yahoo_, that could speak like a\\n_Houyhnhnm_, and seemed, in his words and actions, to discover some\\nglimmerings of reason.”  These delighted to converse with me: they put\\nmany questions, and received such answers as I was able to return.  By\\nall these advantages I made so great a progress, that, in five months\\nfrom my arrival I understood whatever was spoken, and could express\\nmyself tolerably well.\\n\\nThe _Houyhnhnms_, who came to visit my master out of a design of seeing\\nand talking with me, could hardly believe me to be a right _Yahoo_,\\nbecause my body had a different covering from others of my kind.  They\\nwere astonished to observe me without the usual hair or skin, except on\\nmy head, face, and hands; but I discovered that secret to my master upon\\nan accident which happened about a fortnight before.\\n\\nI have already told the reader, that every night, when the family were\\ngone to bed, it was my custom to strip, and cover myself with my clothes.\\nIt happened, one morning early, that my master sent for me by the sorrel\\nnag, who was his valet.  When he came I was fast asleep, my clothes\\nfallen off on one side, and my shirt above my waist.  I awaked at the\\nnoise he made, and observed him to deliver his message in some disorder;\\nafter which he went to my master, and in a great fright gave him a very\\nconfused account of what he had seen.  This I presently discovered, for,\\ngoing as soon as I was dressed to pay my attendance upon his honour, he\\nasked me “the meaning of what his servant had reported, that I was not\\nthe same thing when I slept, as I appeared to be at other times; that his\\nvale assured him, some part of me was white, some yellow, at least not so\\nwhite, and some brown.”\\n\\nI had hitherto concealed the secret of my dress, in order to distinguish\\nmyself, as much as possible, from that cursed race of _Yahoos_; but now I\\nfound it in vain to do so any longer.  Besides, I considered that my\\nclothes and shoes would soon wear out, which already were in a declining\\ncondition, and must be supplied by some contrivance from the hides of\\n_Yahoos_, or other brutes; whereby the whole secret would be known.  I\\ntherefore told my master, “that in the country whence I came, those of my\\nkind always covered their bodies with the hairs of certain animals\\nprepared by art, as well for decency as to avoid the inclemencies of air,\\nboth hot and cold; of which, as to my own person, I would give him\\nimmediate conviction, if he pleased to command me: only desiring his\\nexcuse, if I did not expose those parts that nature taught us to\\nconceal.”  He said, “my discourse was all very strange, but especially\\nthe last part; for he could not understand, why nature should teach us to\\nconceal what nature had given; that neither himself nor family were\\nashamed of any parts of their bodies; but, however, I might do as I\\npleased.”  Whereupon I first unbuttoned my coat, and pulled it off.  I\\ndid the same with my waistcoat.  I drew off my shoes, stockings, and\\nbreeches.  I let my shirt down to my waist, and drew up the bottom;\\nfastening it like a girdle about my middle, to hide my nakedness.\\n\\nMy master observed the whole performance with great signs of curiosity\\nand admiration.  He took up all my clothes in his pastern, one piece\\nafter another, and examined them diligently; he then stroked my body very\\ngently, and looked round me several times; after which, he said, it was\\nplain I must be a perfect _Yahoo_; but that I differed very much from the\\nrest of my species in the softness, whiteness, and smoothness of my skin;\\nmy want of hair in several parts of my body; the shape and shortness of\\nmy claws behind and before; and my affectation of walking continually on\\nmy two hinder feet.  He desired to see no more; and gave me leave to put\\non my clothes again, for I was shuddering with cold.\\n\\nI expressed my uneasiness at his giving me so often the appellation of\\n_Yahoo_, an odious animal, for which I had so utter a hatred and\\ncontempt: I begged he would forbear applying that word to me, and make\\nthe same order in his family and among his friends whom he suffered to\\nsee me.  I requested likewise, “that the secret of my having a false\\ncovering to my body, might be known to none but himself, at least as long\\nas my present clothing should last; for as to what the sorrel nag, his\\nvalet, had observed, his honour might command him to conceal it.”\\n\\nAll this my master very graciously consented to; and thus the secret was\\nkept till my clothes began to wear out, which I was forced to supply by\\nseveral contrivances that shall hereafter be mentioned.  In the meantime,\\nhe desired “I would go on with my utmost diligence to learn their\\nlanguage, because he was more astonished at my capacity for speech and\\nreason, than at the figure of my body, whether it were covered or not;”\\nadding, “that he waited with some impatience to hear the wonders which I\\npromised to tell him.”\\n\\nThenceforward he doubled the pains he had been at to instruct me: he\\nbrought me into all company, and made them treat me with civility;\\n“because,” as he told them, privately, “this would put me into good\\nhumour, and make me more diverting.”\\n\\nEvery day, when I waited on him, beside the trouble he was at in\\nteaching, he would ask me several questions concerning myself, which I\\nanswered as well as I could, and by these means he had already received\\nsome general ideas, though very imperfect.  It would be tedious to relate\\nthe several steps by which I advanced to a more regular conversation; but\\nthe first account I gave of myself in any order and length was to this\\npurpose:\\n\\n“That I came from a very far country, as I already had attempted to tell\\nhim, with about fifty more of my own species; that we travelled upon the\\nseas in a great hollow vessel made of wood, and larger than his honour’s\\nhouse.  I described the ship to him in the best terms I could, and\\nexplained, by the help of my handkerchief displayed, how it was driven\\nforward by the wind.  That upon a quarrel among us, I was set on shore on\\nthis coast, where I walked forward, without knowing whither, till he\\ndelivered me from the persecution of those execrable _Yahoos_.”  He asked\\nme, “who made the ship, and how it was possible that the _Houyhnhnms_ of\\nmy country would leave it to the management of brutes?”  My answer was,\\n“that I durst proceed no further in my relation, unless he would give me\\nhis word and honour that he would not be offended, and then I would tell\\nhim the wonders I had so often promised.”  He agreed; and I went on by\\nassuring him, that the ship was made by creatures like myself; who, in\\nall the countries I had travelled, as well as in my own, were the only\\ngoverning rational animals; and that upon my arrival hither, I was as\\nmuch astonished to see the _Houyhnhnms_ act like rational beings, as he,\\nor his friends, could be, in finding some marks of reason in a creature\\nhe was pleased to call a _Yahoo_; to which I owned my resemblance in\\nevery part, but could not account for their degenerate and brutal nature.\\nI said farther, “that if good fortune ever restored me to my native\\ncountry, to relate my travels hither, as I resolved to do, everybody\\nwould believe, that I said the thing that was not, that I invented the\\nstory out of my own head; and (with all possible respect to himself, his\\nfamily, and friends, and under his promise of not being offended) our\\ncountrymen would hardly think it probable that a _Houyhnhnm_ should be\\nthe presiding creature of a nation, and a _Yahoo_ the brute.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\n\\nThe Houyhnhnm’s notion of truth and falsehood.  The author’s discourse\\ndisapproved by his master.  The author gives a more particular account of\\nhimself, and the accidents of his voyage.\\n\\nMy master heard me with great appearances of uneasiness in his\\ncountenance; because doubting, or not believing, are so little known in\\nthis country, that the inhabitants cannot tell how to behave themselves\\nunder such circumstances.  And I remember, in frequent discourses with my\\nmaster concerning the nature of manhood in other parts of the world,\\nhaving occasion to talk of lying and false representation, it was with\\nmuch difficulty that he comprehended what I meant, although he had\\notherwise a most acute judgment.  For he argued thus: “that the use of\\nspeech was to make us understand one another, and to receive information\\nof facts; now, if any one said the thing which was not, these ends were\\ndefeated, because I cannot properly be said to understand him; and I am\\nso far from receiving information, that he leaves me worse than in\\nignorance; for I am led to believe a thing black, when it is white, and\\nshort, when it is long.”  And these were all the notions he had\\nconcerning that faculty of lying, so perfectly well understood, and so\\nuniversally practised, among human creatures.\\n\\nTo return from this digression.  When I asserted that the _Yahoos_ were\\nthe only governing animals in my country, which my master said was\\naltogether past his conception, he desired to know, “whether we had\\n_Houyhnhnms_ among us, and what was their employment?”  I told him, “we\\nhad great numbers; that in summer they grazed in the fields, and in\\nwinter were kept in houses with hay and oats, where _Yahoo_ servants were\\nemployed to rub their skins smooth, comb their manes, pick their feet,\\nserve them with food, and make their beds.”  “I understand you well,”\\nsaid my master: “it is now very plain, from all you have spoken, that\\nwhatever share of reason the _Yahoos_ pretend to, the _Houyhnhnms_ are\\nyour masters; I heartily wish our _Yahoos_ would be so tractable.”  I\\nbegged “his honour would please to excuse me from proceeding any further,\\nbecause I was very certain that the account he expected from me would be\\nhighly displeasing.”  But he insisted in commanding me to let him know\\nthe best and the worst.  I told him “he should be obeyed.”  I owned “that\\nthe _Houyhnhnms_ among us, whom we called horses, were the most generous\\nand comely animals we had; that they excelled in strength and swiftness;\\nand when they belonged to persons of quality, were employed in\\ntravelling, racing, or drawing chariots; they were treated with much\\nkindness and care, till they fell into diseases, or became foundered in\\nthe feet; but then they were sold, and used to all kind of drudgery till\\nthey died; after which their skins were stripped, and sold for what they\\nwere worth, and their bodies left to be devoured by dogs and birds of\\nprey.  But the common race of horses had not so good fortune, being kept\\nby farmers and carriers, and other mean people, who put them to greater\\nlabour, and fed them worse.”  I described, as well as I could, our way of\\nriding; the shape and use of a bridle, a saddle, a spur, and a whip; of\\nharness and wheels.  I added, “that we fastened plates of a certain hard\\nsubstance, called iron, at the bottom of their feet, to preserve their\\nhoofs from being broken by the stony ways, on which we often travelled.”\\n\\nMy master, after some expressions of great indignation, wondered “how we\\ndared to venture upon a _Houyhnhnm’s_ back; for he was sure, that the\\nweakest servant in his house would be able to shake off the strongest\\n_Yahoo_; or by lying down and rolling on his back, squeeze the brute to\\ndeath.”  I answered “that our horses were trained up, from three or four\\nyears old, to the several uses we intended them for; that if any of them\\nproved intolerably vicious, they were employed for carriages; that they\\nwere severely beaten, while they were young, for any mischievous tricks;\\nthat the males, designed for the common use of riding or draught, were\\ngenerally castrated about two years after their birth, to take down their\\nspirits, and make them more tame and gentle; that they were indeed\\nsensible of rewards and punishments; but his honour would please to\\nconsider, that they had not the least tincture of reason, any more than\\nthe _Yahoos_ in this country.”\\n\\nIt put me to the pains of many circumlocutions, to give my master a right\\nidea of what I spoke; for their language does not abound in variety of\\nwords, because their wants and passions are fewer than among us.  But it\\nis impossible to express his noble resentment at our savage treatment of\\nthe _Houyhnhnm_ race; particularly after I had explained the manner and\\nuse of castrating horses among us, to hinder them from propagating their\\nkind, and to render them more servile.  He said, “if it were possible\\nthere could be any country where _Yahoos_ alone were endued with reason,\\nthey certainly must be the governing animal; because reason in time will\\nalways prevail against brutal strength.  But, considering the frame of\\nour bodies, and especially of mine, he thought no creature of equal bulk\\nwas so ill-contrived for employing that reason in the common offices of\\nlife;” whereupon he desired to know “whether those among whom I lived\\nresembled me, or the _Yahoos_ of his country?”  I assured him, “that I\\nwas as well shaped as most of my age; but the younger, and the females,\\nwere much more soft and tender, and the skins of the latter generally as\\nwhite as milk.”  He said, “I differed indeed from other _Yahoos_, being\\nmuch more cleanly, and not altogether so deformed; but, in point of real\\nadvantage, he thought I differed for the worse: that my nails were of no\\nuse either to my fore or hinder feet; as to my fore feet, he could not\\nproperly call them by that name, for he never observed me to walk upon\\nthem; that they were too soft to bear the ground; that I generally went\\nwith them uncovered; neither was the covering I sometimes wore on them of\\nthe same shape, or so strong as that on my feet behind: that I could not\\nwalk with any security, for if either of my hinder feet slipped, I must\\ninevitably fail.”  He then began to find fault with other parts of my\\nbody: “the flatness of my face, the prominence of my nose, mine eyes\\nplaced directly in front, so that I could not look on either side without\\nturning my head: that I was not able to feed myself, without lifting one\\nof my fore-feet to my mouth: and therefore nature had placed those joints\\nto answer that necessity.  He knew not what could be the use of those\\nseveral clefts and divisions in my feet behind; that these were too soft\\nto bear the hardness and sharpness of stones, without a covering made\\nfrom the skin of some other brute; that my whole body wanted a fence\\nagainst heat and cold, which I was forced to put on and off every day,\\nwith tediousness and trouble: and lastly, that he observed every animal\\nin this country naturally to abhor the _Yahoos_, whom the weaker avoided,\\nand the stronger drove from them.  So that, supposing us to have the gift\\nof reason, he could not see how it were possible to cure that natural\\nantipathy, which every creature discovered against us; nor consequently\\nhow we could tame and render them serviceable.  However, he would,” as he\\nsaid, “debate the matter no farther, because he was more desirous to know\\nmy own story, the country where I was born, and the several actions and\\nevents of my life, before I came hither.”\\n\\nI assured him, “how extremely desirous I was that he should be satisfied\\non every point; but I doubted much, whether it would be possible for me\\nto explain myself on several subjects, whereof his honour could have no\\nconception; because I saw nothing in his country to which I could\\nresemble them; that, however, I would do my best, and strive to express\\nmyself by similitudes, humbly desiring his assistance when I wanted\\nproper words;” which he was pleased to promise me.\\n\\nI said, “my birth was of honest parents, in an island called England;\\nwhich was remote from his country, as many days’ journey as the strongest\\nof his honour’s servants could travel in the annual course of the sun;\\nthat I was bred a surgeon, whose trade it is to cure wounds and hurts in\\nthe body, gotten by accident or violence; that my country was governed by\\na female man, whom we called queen; that I left it to get riches, whereby\\nI might maintain myself and family, when I should return; that, in my\\nlast voyage, I was commander of the ship, and had about fifty _Yahoos_\\nunder me, many of which died at sea, and I was forced to supply them by\\nothers picked out from several nations; that our ship was twice in danger\\nof being sunk, the first time by a great storm, and the second by\\nstriking against a rock.”  Here my master interposed, by asking me, “how\\nI could persuade strangers, out of different countries, to venture with\\nme, after the losses I had sustained, and the hazards I had run?”  I\\nsaid, “they were fellows of desperate fortunes, forced to fly from the\\nplaces of their birth on account of their poverty or their crimes.  Some\\nwere undone by lawsuits; others spent all they had in drinking, whoring,\\nand gaming; others fled for treason; many for murder, theft, poisoning,\\nrobbery, perjury, forgery, coining false money, for committing rapes, or\\nsodomy; for flying from their colours, or deserting to the enemy; and\\nmost of them had broken prison; none of these durst return to their\\nnative countries, for fear of being hanged, or of starving in a jail; and\\ntherefore they were under the necessity of seeking a livelihood in other\\nplaces.”\\n\\nDuring this discourse, my master was pleased to interrupt me several\\ntimes.  I had made use of many circumlocutions in describing to him the\\nnature of the several crimes for which most of our crew had been forced\\nto fly their country.  This labour took up several days’ conversation,\\nbefore he was able to comprehend me.  He was wholly at a loss to know\\nwhat could be the use or necessity of practising those vices.  To clear\\nup which, I endeavoured to give some ideas of the desire of power and\\nriches; of the terrible effects of lust, intemperance, malice, and envy.\\nAll this I was forced to define and describe by putting cases and making\\nsuppositions.  After which, like one whose imagination was struck with\\nsomething never seen or heard of before, he would lift up his eyes with\\namazement and indignation.  Power, government, war, law, punishment, and\\na thousand other things, had no terms wherein that language could express\\nthem, which made the difficulty almost insuperable, to give my master any\\nconception of what I meant.  But being of an excellent understanding,\\nmuch improved by contemplation and converse, he at last arrived at a\\ncompetent knowledge of what human nature, in our parts of the world, is\\ncapable to perform, and desired I would give him some particular account\\nof that land which we call Europe, but especially of my own country.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\n\\nThe author at his master’s command, informs him of the state of England.\\nThe causes of war among the princes of Europe.  The author begins to\\nexplain the English constitution.\\n\\nThe reader may please to observe, that the following extract of many\\nconversations I had with my master, contains a summary of the most\\nmaterial points which were discoursed at several times for above two\\nyears; his honour often desiring fuller satisfaction, as I farther\\nimproved in the _Houyhnhnm_ tongue.  I laid before him, as well as I\\ncould, the whole state of Europe; I discoursed of trade and manufactures,\\nof arts and sciences; and the answers I gave to all the questions he\\nmade, as they arose upon several subjects, were a fund of conversation\\nnot to be exhausted.  But I shall here only set down the substance of\\nwhat passed between us concerning my own country, reducing it in order as\\nwell as I can, without any regard to time or other circumstances, while I\\nstrictly adhere to truth.  My only concern is, that I shall hardly be\\nable to do justice to my master’s arguments and expressions, which must\\nneeds suffer by my want of capacity, as well as by a translation into our\\nbarbarous English.\\n\\nIn obedience, therefore, to his honour’s commands, I related to him the\\nRevolution under the Prince of Orange; the long war with France, entered\\ninto by the said prince, and renewed by his successor, the present queen,\\nwherein the greatest powers of Christendom were engaged, and which still\\ncontinued: I computed, at his request, “that about a million of _Yahoos_\\nmight have been killed in the whole progress of it; and perhaps a hundred\\nor more cities taken, and five times as many ships burnt or sunk.”\\n\\nHe asked me, “what were the usual causes or motives that made one country\\ngo to war with another?”  I answered “they were innumerable; but I should\\nonly mention a few of the chief.  Sometimes the ambition of princes, who\\nnever think they have land or people enough to govern; sometimes the\\ncorruption of ministers, who engage their master in a war, in order to\\nstifle or divert the clamour of the subjects against their evil\\nadministration.  Difference in opinions has cost many millions of lives:\\nfor instance, whether flesh be bread, or bread be flesh; whether the\\njuice of a certain berry be blood or wine; whether whistling be a vice or\\na virtue; whether it be better to kiss a post, or throw it into the fire;\\nwhat is the best colour for a coat, whether black, white, red, or gray;\\nand whether it should be long or short, narrow or wide, dirty or clean;\\nwith many more.  Neither are any wars so furious and bloody, or of so\\nlong a continuance, as those occasioned by difference in opinion,\\nespecially if it be in things indifferent.\\n\\n“Sometimes the quarrel between two princes is to decide which of them\\nshall dispossess a third of his dominions, where neither of them pretend\\nto any right.  Sometimes one prince quarrels with another for fear the\\nother should quarrel with him.  Sometimes a war is entered upon, because\\nthe enemy is too strong; and sometimes, because he is too weak.\\nSometimes our neighbours want the things which we have, or have the\\nthings which we want, and we both fight, till they take ours, or give us\\ntheirs.  It is a very justifiable cause of a war, to invade a country\\nafter the people have been wasted by famine, destroyed by pestilence, or\\nembroiled by factions among themselves.  It is justifiable to enter into\\nwar against our nearest ally, when one of his towns lies convenient for\\nus, or a territory of land, that would render our dominions round and\\ncomplete.  If a prince sends forces into a nation, where the people are\\npoor and ignorant, he may lawfully put half of them to death, and make\\nslaves of the rest, in order to civilize and reduce them from their\\nbarbarous way of living.  It is a very kingly, honourable, and frequent\\npractice, when one prince desires the assistance of another, to secure\\nhim against an invasion, that the assistant, when he has driven out the\\ninvader, should seize on the dominions himself, and kill, imprison, or\\nbanish, the prince he came to relieve.  Alliance by blood, or marriage,\\nis a frequent cause of war between princes; and the nearer the kindred\\nis, the greater their disposition to quarrel; poor nations are hungry,\\nand rich nations are proud; and pride and hunger will ever be at\\nvariance.  For these reasons, the trade of a soldier is held the most\\nhonourable of all others; because a soldier is a _Yahoo_ hired to kill,\\nin cold blood, as many of his own species, who have never offended him,\\nas possibly he can.\\n\\n“There is likewise a kind of beggarly princes in Europe, not able to make\\nwar by themselves, who hire out their troops to richer nations, for so\\nmuch a day to each man; of which they keep three-fourths to themselves,\\nand it is the best part of their maintenance: such are those in many\\nnorthern parts of Europe.”\\n\\n“What you have told me,” said my master, “upon the subject of war, does\\nindeed discover most admirably the effects of that reason you pretend to:\\nhowever, it is happy that the shame is greater than the danger; and that\\nnature has left you utterly incapable of doing much mischief.  For, your\\nmouths lying flat with your faces, you can hardly bite each other to any\\npurpose, unless by consent.  Then as to the claws upon your feet before\\nand behind, they are so short and tender, that one of our _Yahoos_ would\\ndrive a dozen of yours before him.  And therefore, in recounting the\\nnumbers of those who have been killed in battle, I cannot but think you\\nhave said the thing which is not.”\\n\\nI could not forbear shaking my head, and smiling a little at his\\nignorance.  And being no stranger to the art of war, I gave him a\\ndescription of cannons, culverins, muskets, carabines, pistols, bullets,\\npowder, swords, bayonets, battles, sieges, retreats, attacks, undermines,\\ncountermines, bombardments, sea fights, ships sunk with a thousand men,\\ntwenty thousand killed on each side, dying groans, limbs flying in the\\nair, smoke, noise, confusion, trampling to death under horses’ feet,\\nflight, pursuit, victory; fields strewed with carcases, left for food to\\ndogs and wolves and birds of prey; plundering, stripping, ravishing,\\nburning, and destroying.  And to set forth the valour of my own dear\\ncountrymen, I assured him, “that I had seen them blow up a hundred\\nenemies at once in a siege, and as many in a ship, and beheld the dead\\nbodies drop down in pieces from the clouds, to the great diversion of the\\nspectators.”\\n\\nI was going on to more particulars, when my master commanded me silence.\\nHe said, “whoever understood the nature of _Yahoos_, might easily believe\\nit possible for so vile an animal to be capable of every action I had\\nnamed, if their strength and cunning equalled their malice.  But as my\\ndiscourse had increased his abhorrence of the whole species, so he found\\nit gave him a disturbance in his mind to which he was wholly a stranger\\nbefore.  He thought his ears, being used to such abominable words, might,\\nby degrees, admit them with less detestation: that although he hated the\\n_Yahoos_ of this country, yet he no more blamed them for their odious\\nqualities, than he did a _gnnayh_ (a bird of prey) for its cruelty, or a\\nsharp stone for cutting his hoof.  But when a creature pretending to\\nreason could be capable of such enormities, he dreaded lest the\\ncorruption of that faculty might be worse than brutality itself.  He\\nseemed therefore confident, that, instead of reason we were only\\npossessed of some quality fitted to increase our natural vices; as the\\nreflection from a troubled stream returns the image of an ill shapen\\nbody, not only larger but more distorted.”\\n\\nHe added, “that he had heard too much upon the subject of war, both in\\nthis and some former discourses.  There was another point, which a little\\nperplexed him at present.  I had informed him, that some of our crew left\\ntheir country on account of being ruined by law; that I had already\\nexplained the meaning of the word; but he was at a loss how it should\\ncome to pass, that the law, which was intended for every man’s\\npreservation, should be any man’s ruin.  Therefore he desired to be\\nfurther satisfied what I meant by law, and the dispensers thereof,\\naccording to the present practice in my own country; because he thought\\nnature and reason were sufficient guides for a reasonable animal, as we\\npretended to be, in showing us what he ought to do, and what to avoid.”\\n\\nI assured his honour, “that the law was a science in which I had not much\\nconversed, further than by employing advocates, in vain, upon some\\ninjustices that had been done me: however, I would give him all the\\nsatisfaction I was able.”\\n\\nI said, “there was a society of men among us, bred up from their youth in\\nthe art of proving, by words multiplied for the purpose, that white is\\nblack, and black is white, according as they are paid.  To this society\\nall the rest of the people are slaves.  For example, if my neighbour has\\na mind to my cow, he has a lawyer to prove that he ought to have my cow\\nfrom me.  I must then hire another to defend my right, it being against\\nall rules of law that any man should be allowed to speak for himself.\\nNow, in this case, I, who am the right owner, lie under two great\\ndisadvantages: first, my lawyer, being practised almost from his cradle\\nin defending falsehood, is quite out of his element when he would be an\\nadvocate for justice, which is an unnatural office he always attempts\\nwith great awkwardness, if not with ill-will.  The second disadvantage\\nis, that my lawyer must proceed with great caution, or else he will be\\nreprimanded by the judges, and abhorred by his brethren, as one that\\nwould lessen the practice of the law.  And therefore I have but two\\nmethods to preserve my cow.  The first is, to gain over my adversary’s\\nlawyer with a double fee, who will then betray his client by insinuating\\nthat he hath justice on his side.  The second way is for my lawyer to\\nmake my cause appear as unjust as he can, by allowing the cow to belong\\nto my adversary: and this, if it be skilfully done, will certainly\\nbespeak the favour of the bench.  Now your honour is to know, that these\\njudges are persons appointed to decide all controversies of property, as\\nwell as for the trial of criminals, and picked out from the most\\ndexterous lawyers, who are grown old or lazy; and having been biassed all\\ntheir lives against truth and equity, lie under such a fatal necessity of\\nfavouring fraud, perjury, and oppression, that I have known some of them\\nrefuse a large bribe from the side where justice lay, rather than injure\\nthe faculty, by doing any thing unbecoming their nature or their office.\\n\\n“It is a maxim among these lawyers that whatever has been done before,\\nmay legally be done again: and therefore they take special care to record\\nall the decisions formerly made against common justice, and the general\\nreason of mankind.  These, under the name of precedents, they produce as\\nauthorities to justify the most iniquitous opinions; and the judges never\\nfail of directing accordingly.\\n\\n“In pleading, they studiously avoid entering into the merits of the\\ncause; but are loud, violent, and tedious, in dwelling upon all\\ncircumstances which are not to the purpose.  For instance, in the case\\nalready mentioned; they never desire to know what claim or title my\\nadversary has to my cow; but whether the said cow were red or black; her\\nhorns long or short; whether the field I graze her in be round or square;\\nwhether she was milked at home or abroad; what diseases she is subject\\nto, and the like; after which they consult precedents, adjourn the cause\\nfrom time to time, and in ten, twenty, or thirty years, come to an issue.\\n\\n“It is likewise to be observed, that this society has a peculiar cant and\\njargon of their own, that no other mortal can understand, and wherein all\\ntheir laws are written, which they take special care to multiply; whereby\\nthey have wholly confounded the very essence of truth and falsehood, of\\nright and wrong; so that it will take thirty years to decide, whether the\\nfield left me by my ancestors for six generations belongs to me, or to a\\nstranger three hundred miles off.\\n\\n“In the trial of persons accused for crimes against the state, the method\\nis much more short and commendable: the judge first sends to sound the\\ndisposition of those in power, after which he can easily hang or save a\\ncriminal, strictly preserving all due forms of law.”\\n\\nHere my master interposing, said, “it was a pity, that creatures endowed\\nwith such prodigious abilities of mind, as these lawyers, by the\\ndescription I gave of them, must certainly be, were not rather encouraged\\nto be instructors of others in wisdom and knowledge.”  In answer to which\\nI assured his honour, “that in all points out of their own trade, they\\nwere usually the most ignorant and stupid generation among us, the most\\ndespicable in common conversation, avowed enemies to all knowledge and\\nlearning, and equally disposed to pervert the general reason of mankind\\nin every other subject of discourse as in that of their own profession.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\n\\nA continuation of the state of England under Queen Anne.  The character\\nof a first minister of state in European courts.\\n\\nMy master was yet wholly at a loss to understand what motives could\\nincite this race of lawyers to perplex, disquiet, and weary themselves,\\nand engage in a confederacy of injustice, merely for the sake of injuring\\ntheir fellow-animals; neither could he comprehend what I meant in saying,\\nthey did it for hire.  Whereupon I was at much pains to describe to him\\nthe use of money, the materials it was made of, and the value of the\\nmetals; “that when a _Yahoo_ had got a great store of this precious\\nsubstance, he was able to purchase whatever he had a mind to; the finest\\nclothing, the noblest houses, great tracts of land, the most costly meats\\nand drinks, and have his choice of the most beautiful females.  Therefore\\nsince money alone was able to perform all these feats, our _Yahoos_\\nthought they could never have enough of it to spend, or to save, as they\\nfound themselves inclined, from their natural bent either to profusion or\\navarice; that the rich man enjoyed the fruit of the poor man’s labour,\\nand the latter were a thousand to one in proportion to the former; that\\nthe bulk of our people were forced to live miserably, by labouring every\\nday for small wages, to make a few live plentifully.”\\n\\nI enlarged myself much on these, and many other particulars to the same\\npurpose; but his honour was still to seek; for he went upon a\\nsupposition, that all animals had a title to their share in the\\nproductions of the earth, and especially those who presided over the\\nrest.  Therefore he desired I would let him know, “what these costly\\nmeats were, and how any of us happened to want them?”  Whereupon I\\nenumerated as many sorts as came into my head, with the various methods\\nof dressing them, which could not be done without sending vessels by sea\\nto every part of the world, as well for liquors to drink as for sauces\\nand innumerable other conveniences.  I assured him “that this whole globe\\nof earth must be at least three times gone round before one of our better\\nfemale _Yahoos_ could get her breakfast, or a cup to put it in.”  He said\\n“that must needs be a miserable country which cannot furnish food for its\\nown inhabitants.  But what he chiefly wondered at was, how such vast\\ntracts of ground as I described should be wholly without fresh water, and\\nthe people put to the necessity of sending over the sea for drink.”  I\\nreplied “that England (the dear place of my nativity) was computed to\\nproduce three times the quantity of food more than its inhabitants are\\nable to consume, as well as liquors extracted from grain, or pressed out\\nof the fruit of certain trees, which made excellent drink, and the same\\nproportion in every other convenience of life.  But, in order to feed the\\nluxury and intemperance of the males, and the vanity of the females, we\\nsent away the greatest part of our necessary things to other countries,\\nwhence, in return, we brought the materials of diseases, folly, and vice,\\nto spend among ourselves.  Hence it follows of necessity, that vast\\nnumbers of our people are compelled to seek their livelihood by begging,\\nrobbing, stealing, cheating, pimping, flattering, suborning, forswearing,\\nforging, gaming, lying, fawning, hectoring, voting, scribbling,\\nstar-gazing, poisoning, whoring, canting, libelling, freethinking, and\\nthe like occupations:” every one of which terms I was at much pains to\\nmake him understand.\\n\\n“That wine was not imported among us from foreign countries to supply the\\nwant of water or other drinks, but because it was a sort of liquid which\\nmade us merry by putting us out of our senses, diverted all melancholy\\nthoughts, begat wild extravagant imaginations in the brain, raised our\\nhopes and banished our fears, suspended every office of reason for a\\ntime, and deprived us of the use of our limbs, till we fell into a\\nprofound sleep; although it must be confessed, that we always awaked sick\\nand dispirited; and that the use of this liquor filled us with diseases\\nwhich made our lives uncomfortable and short.\\n\\n“But beside all this, the bulk of our people supported themselves by\\nfurnishing the necessities or conveniences of life to the rich and to\\neach other.  For instance, when I am at home, and dressed as I ought to\\nbe, I carry on my body the workmanship of a hundred tradesmen; the\\nbuilding and furniture of my house employ as many more, and five times\\nthe number to adorn my wife.”\\n\\nI was going on to tell him of another sort of people, who get their\\nlivelihood by attending the sick, having, upon some occasions, informed\\nhis honour that many of my crew had died of diseases.  But here it was\\nwith the utmost difficulty that I brought him to apprehend what I meant.\\n“He could easily conceive, that a _Houyhnhnm_, grew weak and heavy a few\\ndays before his death, or by some accident might hurt a limb; but that\\nnature, who works all things to perfection, should suffer any pains to\\nbreed in our bodies, he thought impossible, and desired to know the\\nreason of so unaccountable an evil.”\\n\\nI told him “we fed on a thousand things which operated contrary to each\\nother; that we ate when we were not hungry, and drank without the\\nprovocation of thirst; that we sat whole nights drinking strong liquors,\\nwithout eating a bit, which disposed us to sloth, inflamed our bodies,\\nand precipitated or prevented digestion; that prostitute female _Yahoos_\\nacquired a certain malady, which bred rottenness in the bones of those\\nwho fell into their embraces; that this, and many other diseases, were\\npropagated from father to son; so that great numbers came into the world\\nwith complicated maladies upon them; that it would be endless to give him\\na catalogue of all diseases incident to human bodies, for they would not\\nbe fewer than five or six hundred, spread over every limb and joint—in\\nshort, every part, external and intestine, having diseases appropriated\\nto itself.  To remedy which, there was a sort of people bred up among us\\nin the profession, or pretence, of curing the sick.  And because I had\\nsome skill in the faculty, I would, in gratitude to his honour, let him\\nknow the whole mystery and method by which they proceed.\\n\\n“Their fundamental is, that all diseases arise from repletion; whence\\nthey conclude, that a great evacuation of the body is necessary, either\\nthrough the natural passage or upwards at the mouth.  Their next business\\nis from herbs, minerals, gums, oils, shells, salts, juices, sea-weed,\\nexcrements, barks of trees, serpents, toads, frogs, spiders, dead men’s\\nflesh and bones, birds, beasts, and fishes, to form a composition, for\\nsmell and taste, the most abominable, nauseous, and detestable, they can\\npossibly contrive, which the stomach immediately rejects with loathing,\\nand this they call a vomit; or else, from the same store-house, with some\\nother poisonous additions, they command us to take in at the orifice\\nabove or below (just as the physician then happens to be disposed) a\\nmedicine equally annoying and disgustful to the bowels; which, relaxing\\nthe belly, drives down all before it; and this they call a purge, or a\\nclyster.  For nature (as the physicians allege) having intended the\\nsuperior anterior orifice only for the intromission of solids and\\nliquids, and the inferior posterior for ejection, these artists\\ningeniously considering that in all diseases nature is forced out of her\\nseat, therefore, to replace her in it, the body must be treated in a\\nmanner directly contrary, by interchanging the use of each orifice;\\nforcing solids and liquids in at the anus, and making evacuations at the\\nmouth.\\n\\n“But, besides real diseases, we are subject to many that are only\\nimaginary, for which the physicians have invented imaginary cures; these\\nhave their several names, and so have the drugs that are proper for them;\\nand with these our female _Yahoos_ are always infested.\\n\\n“One great excellency in this tribe, is their skill at prognostics,\\nwherein they seldom fail; their predictions in real diseases, when they\\nrise to any degree of malignity, generally portending death, which is\\nalways in their power, when recovery is not: and therefore, upon any\\nunexpected signs of amendment, after they have pronounced their sentence,\\nrather than be accused as false prophets, they know how to approve their\\nsagacity to the world, by a seasonable dose.\\n\\n“They are likewise of special use to husbands and wives who are grown\\nweary of their mates; to eldest sons, to great ministers of state, and\\noften to princes.”\\n\\nI had formerly, upon occasion, discoursed with my master upon the nature\\nof government in general, and particularly of our own excellent\\nconstitution, deservedly the wonder and envy of the whole world.  But\\nhaving here accidentally mentioned a minister of state, he commanded me,\\nsome time after, to inform him, “what species of _Yahoo_ I particularly\\nmeant by that appellation.”\\n\\nI told him, “that a first or chief minister of state, who was the person\\nI intended to describe, was the creature wholly exempt from joy and\\ngrief, love and hatred, pity and anger; at least, makes use of no other\\npassions, but a violent desire of wealth, power, and titles; that he\\napplies his words to all uses, except to the indication of his mind; that\\nhe never tells a truth but with an intent that you should take it for a\\nlie; nor a lie, but with a design that you should take it for a truth;\\nthat those he speaks worst of behind their backs are in the surest way of\\npreferment; and whenever he begins to praise you to others, or to\\nyourself, you are from that day forlorn.  The worst mark you can receive\\nis a promise, especially when it is confirmed with an oath; after which,\\nevery wise man retires, and gives over all hopes.\\n\\n“There are three methods, by which a man may rise to be chief minister.\\nThe first is, by knowing how, with prudence, to dispose of a wife, a\\ndaughter, or a sister; the second, by betraying or undermining his\\npredecessor; and the third is, by a furious zeal, in public assemblies,\\nagainst the corruption’s of the court.  But a wise prince would rather\\nchoose to employ those who practise the last of these methods; because\\nsuch zealots prove always the most obsequious and subservient to the will\\nand passions of their master.  That these ministers, having all\\nemployments at their disposal, preserve themselves in power, by bribing\\nthe majority of a senate or great council; and at last, by an expedient,\\ncalled an act of indemnity” (whereof I described the nature to him),\\n“they secure themselves from after-reckonings, and retire from the public\\nladen with the spoils of the nation.\\n\\n“The palace of a chief minister is a seminary to breed up others in his\\nown trade: the pages, lackeys, and porters, by imitating their master,\\nbecome ministers of state in their several districts, and learn to excel\\nin the three principal ingredients, of insolence, lying, and bribery.\\nAccordingly, they have a subaltern court paid to them by persons of the\\nbest rank; and sometimes by the force of dexterity and impudence, arrive,\\nthrough several gradations, to be successors to their lord.\\n\\n“He is usually governed by a decayed wench, or favourite footman, who are\\nthe tunnels through which all graces are conveyed, and may properly be\\ncalled, in the last resort, the governors of the kingdom.”\\n\\nOne day, in discourse, my master, having heard me mention the nobility of\\nmy country, was pleased to make me a compliment which I could not pretend\\nto deserve: “that he was sure I must have been born of some noble family,\\nbecause I far exceeded in shape, colour, and cleanliness, all the\\n_Yahoos_ of his nation, although I seemed to fail in strength and\\nagility, which must be imputed to my different way of living from those\\nother brutes; and besides I was not only endowed with the faculty of\\nspeech, but likewise with some rudiments of reason, to a degree that,\\nwith all his acquaintance, I passed for a prodigy.”\\n\\nHe made me observe, “that among the _Houyhnhnms_, the white, the sorrel,\\nand the iron-gray, were not so exactly shaped as the bay, the\\ndapple-gray, and the black; nor born with equal talents of mind, or a\\ncapacity to improve them; and therefore continued always in the condition\\nof servants, without ever aspiring to match out of their own race, which\\nin that country would be reckoned monstrous and unnatural.”\\n\\nI made his honour my most humble acknowledgments for the good opinion he\\nwas pleased to conceive of me, but assured him at the same time, “that my\\nbirth was of the lower sort, having been born of plain honest parents,\\nwho were just able to give me a tolerable education; that nobility, among\\nus, was altogether a different thing from the idea he had of it; that our\\nyoung noblemen are bred from their childhood in idleness and luxury;\\nthat, as soon as years will permit, they consume their vigour, and\\ncontract odious diseases among lewd females; and when their fortunes are\\nalmost ruined, they marry some woman of mean birth, disagreeable person,\\nand unsound constitution (merely for the sake of money), whom they hate\\nand despise.  That the productions of such marriages are generally\\nscrofulous, rickety, or deformed children; by which means the family\\nseldom continues above three generations, unless the wife takes care to\\nprovide a healthy father, among her neighbours or domestics, in order to\\nimprove and continue the breed.  That a weak diseased body, a meagre\\ncountenance, and sallow complexion, are the true marks of noble blood;\\nand a healthy robust appearance is so disgraceful in a man of quality,\\nthat the world concludes his real father to have been a groom or a\\ncoachman.  The imperfections of his mind run parallel with those of his\\nbody, being a composition of spleen, dullness, ignorance, caprice,\\nsensuality, and pride.\\n\\n“Without the consent of this illustrious body, no law can be enacted,\\nrepealed, or altered: and these nobles have likewise the decision of all\\nour possessions, without appeal.” {514}\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\n\\nThe author’s great love of his native country.  His master’s observations\\nupon the constitution and administration of England, as described by the\\nauthor, with parallel cases and comparisons.  His master’s observations\\nupon human nature.\\n\\nThe reader may be disposed to wonder how I could prevail on myself to\\ngive so free a representation of my own species, among a race of mortals\\nwho are already too apt to conceive the vilest opinion of humankind, from\\nthat entire congruity between me and their _Yahoos_.  But I must freely\\nconfess, that the many virtues of those excellent quadrupeds, placed in\\nopposite view to human corruptions, had so far opened my eyes and\\nenlarged my understanding, that I began to view the actions and passions\\nof man in a very different light, and to think the honour of my own kind\\nnot worth managing; which, besides, it was impossible for me to do,\\nbefore a person of so acute a judgment as my master, who daily convinced\\nme of a thousand faults in myself, whereof I had not the least perception\\nbefore, and which, with us, would never be numbered even among human\\ninfirmities.  I had likewise learned, from his example, an utter\\ndetestation of all falsehood or disguise; and truth appeared so amiable\\nto me, that I determined upon sacrificing every thing to it.\\n\\nLet me deal so candidly with the reader as to confess that there was yet\\na much stronger motive for the freedom I took in my representation of\\nthings.  I had not yet been a year in this country before I contracted\\nsuch a love and veneration for the inhabitants, that I entered on a firm\\nresolution never to return to humankind, but to pass the rest of my life\\namong these admirable _Houyhnhnms_, in the contemplation and practice of\\nevery virtue, where I could have no example or incitement to vice.  But\\nit was decreed by fortune, my perpetual enemy, that so great a felicity\\nshould not fall to my share.  However, it is now some comfort to reflect,\\nthat in what I said of my countrymen, I extenuated their faults as much\\nas I durst before so strict an examiner; and upon every article gave as\\nfavourable a turn as the matter would bear.  For, indeed, who is there\\nalive that will not be swayed by his bias and partiality to the place of\\nhis birth?\\n\\nI have related the substance of several conversations I had with my\\nmaster during the greatest part of the time I had the honour to be in his\\nservice; but have, indeed, for brevity sake, omitted much more than is\\nhere set down.\\n\\nWhen I had answered all his questions, and his curiosity seemed to be\\nfully satisfied, he sent for me one morning early, and commanded me to\\nsit down at some distance (an honour which he had never before conferred\\nupon me).  He said, “he had been very seriously considering my whole\\nstory, as far as it related both to myself and my country; that he looked\\nupon us as a sort of animals, to whose share, by what accident he could\\nnot conjecture, some small pittance of reason had fallen, whereof we made\\nno other use, than by its assistance, to aggravate our natural\\ncorruptions, and to acquire new ones, which nature had not given us; that\\nwe disarmed ourselves of the few abilities she had bestowed; had been\\nvery successful in multiplying our original wants, and seemed to spend\\nour whole lives in vain endeavours to supply them by our own inventions;\\nthat, as to myself, it was manifest I had neither the strength nor\\nagility of a common _Yahoo_; that I walked infirmly on my hinder feet;\\nhad found out a contrivance to make my claws of no use or defence, and to\\nremove the hair from my chin, which was intended as a shelter from the\\nsun and the weather: lastly, that I could neither run with speed, nor\\nclimb trees like my brethren,” as he called them, “the _Yahoos_ in his\\ncountry.\\n\\n“That our institutions of government and law were plainly owing to our\\ngross defects in reason, and by consequence in virtue; because reason\\nalone is sufficient to govern a rational creature; which was, therefore,\\na character we had no pretence to challenge, even from the account I had\\ngiven of my own people; although he manifestly perceived, that, in order\\nto favour them, I had concealed many particulars, and often said the\\nthing which was not.\\n\\n“He was the more confirmed in this opinion, because, he observed, that as\\nI agreed in every feature of my body with other _Yahoos_, except where it\\nwas to my real disadvantage in point of strength, speed, and activity,\\nthe shortness of my claws, and some other particulars where nature had no\\npart; so from the representation I had given him of our lives, our\\nmanners, and our actions, he found as near a resemblance in the\\ndisposition of our minds.”  He said, “the _Yahoos_ were known to hate one\\nanother, more than they did any different species of animals; and the\\nreason usually assigned was, the odiousness of their own shapes, which\\nall could see in the rest, but not in themselves.  He had therefore begun\\nto think it not unwise in us to cover our bodies, and by that invention\\nconceal many of our deformities from each other, which would else be\\nhardly supportable.  But he now found he had been mistaken, and that the\\ndissensions of those brutes in his country were owing to the same cause\\nwith ours, as I had described them.  For if,” said he, “you throw among\\nfive _Yahoos_ as much food as would be sufficient for fifty, they will,\\ninstead of eating peaceably, fall together by the ears, each single one\\nimpatient to have all to itself; and therefore a servant was usually\\nemployed to stand by while they were feeding abroad, and those kept at\\nhome were tied at a distance from each other: that if a cow died of age\\nor accident, before a _Houyhnhnm_ could secure it for his own _Yahoos_,\\nthose in the neighbourhood would come in herds to seize it, and then\\nwould ensue such a battle as I had described, with terrible wounds made\\nby their claws on both sides, although they seldom were able to kill one\\nanother, for want of such convenient instruments of death as we had\\ninvented.  At other times, the like battles have been fought between the\\n_Yahoos_ of several neighbourhoods, without any visible cause; those of\\none district watching all opportunities to surprise the next, before they\\nare prepared.  But if they find their project has miscarried, they return\\nhome, and, for want of enemies, engage in what I call a civil war among\\nthemselves.\\n\\n“That in some fields of his country there are certain shining stones of\\nseveral colours, whereof the _Yahoos_ are violently fond: and when part\\nof these stones is fixed in the earth, as it sometimes happens, they will\\ndig with their claws for whole days to get them out; then carry them\\naway, and hide them by heaps in their kennels; but still looking round\\nwith great caution, for fear their comrades should find out their\\ntreasure.”  My master said, “he could never discover the reason of this\\nunnatural appetite, or how these stones could be of any use to a _Yahoo_;\\nbut now he believed it might proceed from the same principle of avarice\\nwhich I had ascribed to mankind.  That he had once, by way of experiment,\\nprivately removed a heap of these stones from the place where one of his\\n_Yahoos_ had buried it; whereupon the sordid animal, missing his\\ntreasure, by his loud lamenting brought the whole herd to the place,\\nthere miserably howled, then fell to biting and tearing the rest, began\\nto pine away, would neither eat, nor sleep, nor work, till he ordered a\\nservant privately to convey the stones into the same hole, and hide them\\nas before; which, when his _Yahoo_ had found, he presently recovered his\\nspirits and good humour, but took good care to remove them to a better\\nhiding place, and has ever since been a very serviceable brute.”\\n\\nMy master further assured me, which I also observed myself, “that in the\\nfields where the shining stones abound, the fiercest and most frequent\\nbattles are fought, occasioned by perpetual inroads of the neighbouring\\n_Yahoos_.”\\n\\nHe said, “it was common, when two _Yahoos_ discovered such a stone in a\\nfield, and were contending which of them should be the proprietor, a\\nthird would take the advantage, and carry it away from them both;” which\\nmy master would needs contend to have some kind of resemblance with our\\nsuits at law; wherein I thought it for our credit not to undeceive him;\\nsince the decision he mentioned was much more equitable than many decrees\\namong us; because the plaintiff and defendant there lost nothing beside\\nthe stone they contended for: whereas our courts of equity would never\\nhave dismissed the cause, while either of them had any thing left.\\n\\nMy master, continuing his discourse, said, “there was nothing that\\nrendered the _Yahoos_ more odious, than their undistinguishing appetite\\nto devour every thing that came in their way, whether herbs, roots,\\nberries, the corrupted flesh of animals, or all mingled together: and it\\nwas peculiar in their temper, that they were fonder of what they could\\nget by rapine or stealth, at a greater distance, than much better food\\nprovided for them at home.  If their prey held out, they would eat till\\nthey were ready to burst; after which, nature had pointed out to them a\\ncertain root that gave them a general evacuation.\\n\\n“There was also another kind of root, very juicy, but somewhat rare and\\ndifficult to be found, which the _Yahoos_ sought for with much eagerness,\\nand would suck it with great delight; it produced in them the same\\neffects that wine has upon us.  It would make them sometimes hug, and\\nsometimes tear one another; they would howl, and grin, and chatter, and\\nreel, and tumble, and then fall asleep in the mud.”\\n\\nI did indeed observe that the _Yahoos_ were the only animals in this\\ncountry subject to any diseases; which, however, were much fewer than\\nhorses have among us, and contracted, not by any ill-treatment they meet\\nwith, but by the nastiness and greediness of that sordid brute.  Neither\\nhas their language any more than a general appellation for those\\nmaladies, which is borrowed from the name of the beast, and called\\n_hnea-yahoo_, or _Yahoo’s evil_; and the cure prescribed is a mixture of\\ntheir own dung and urine, forcibly put down the _Yahoo’s_ throat.  This I\\nhave since often known to have been taken with success, and do here\\nfreely recommend it to my countrymen for the public good, as an admirable\\nspecific against all diseases produced by repletion.\\n\\n“As to learning, government, arts, manufactures, and the like,” my master\\nconfessed, “he could find little or no resemblance between the _Yahoos_\\nof that country and those in ours; for he only meant to observe what\\nparity there was in our natures.  He had heard, indeed, some curious\\n_Houyhnhnms_ observe, that in most herds there was a sort of ruling\\n_Yahoo_ (as among us there is generally some leading or principal stag in\\na park), who was always more deformed in body, and mischievous in\\ndisposition, than any of the rest; that this leader had usually a\\nfavourite as like himself as he could get, whose employment was to lick\\nhis master’s feet and posteriors, and drive the female _Yahoos_ to his\\nkennel; for which he was now and then rewarded with a piece of ass’s\\nflesh.  This favourite is hated by the whole herd, and therefore, to\\nprotect himself, keeps always near the person of his leader.  He usually\\ncontinues in office till a worse can be found; but the very moment he is\\ndiscarded, his successor, at the head of all the _Yahoos_ in that\\ndistrict, young and old, male and female, come in a body, and discharge\\ntheir excrements upon him from head to foot.  But how far this might be\\napplicable to our courts, and favourites, and ministers of state, my\\nmaster said I could best determine.”\\n\\nI durst make no return to this malicious insinuation, which debased human\\nunderstanding below the sagacity of a common hound, who has judgment\\nenough to distinguish and follow the cry of the ablest dog in the pack,\\nwithout being ever mistaken.\\n\\nMy master told me, “there were some qualities remarkable in the _Yahoos_,\\nwhich he had not observed me to mention, or at least very slightly, in\\nthe accounts I had given of humankind.”  He said, “those animals, like\\nother brutes, had their females in common; but in this they differed,\\nthat the she _Yahoo_ would admit the males while she was pregnant; and\\nthat the hes would quarrel and fight with the females, as fiercely as\\nwith each other; both which practices were such degrees of infamous\\nbrutality, as no other sensitive creature ever arrived at.\\n\\n“Another thing he wondered at in the _Yahoos_, was their strange\\ndisposition to nastiness and dirt; whereas there appears to be a natural\\nlove of cleanliness in all other animals.”  As to the two former\\naccusations, I was glad to let them pass without any reply, because I had\\nnot a word to offer upon them in defence of my species, which otherwise I\\ncertainly had done from my own inclinations.  But I could have easily\\nvindicated humankind from the imputation of singularity upon the last\\narticle, if there had been any swine in that country (as unluckily for me\\nthere were not), which, although it may be a sweeter quadruped than a\\n_Yahoo_, cannot, I humbly conceive, in justice, pretend to more\\ncleanliness; and so his honour himself must have owned, if he had seen\\ntheir filthy way of feeding, and their custom of wallowing and sleeping\\nin the mud.\\n\\nMy master likewise mentioned another quality which his servants had\\ndiscovered in several Yahoos, and to him was wholly unaccountable.  He\\nsaid, “a fancy would sometimes take a _Yahoo_ to retire into a corner, to\\nlie down, and howl, and groan, and spurn away all that came near him,\\nalthough he were young and fat, wanted neither food nor water, nor did\\nthe servant imagine what could possibly ail him.  And the only remedy\\nthey found was, to set him to hard work, after which he would infallibly\\ncome to himself.”  To this I was silent out of partiality to my own kind;\\nyet here I could plainly discover the true seeds of spleen, which only\\nseizes on the lazy, the luxurious, and the rich; who, if they were forced\\nto undergo the same regimen, I would undertake for the cure.\\n\\nHis honour had further observed, “that a female _Yahoo_ would often stand\\nbehind a bank or a bush, to gaze on the young males passing by, and then\\nappear, and hide, using many antic gestures and grimaces, at which time\\nit was observed that she had a most offensive smell; and when any of the\\nmales advanced, would slowly retire, looking often back, and with a\\ncounterfeit show of fear, run off into some convenient place, where she\\nknew the male would follow her.\\n\\n“At other times, if a female stranger came among them, three or four of\\nher own sex would get about her, and stare, and chatter, and grin, and\\nsmell her all over; and then turn off with gestures, that seemed to\\nexpress contempt and disdain.”\\n\\nPerhaps my master might refine a little in these speculations, which he\\nhad drawn from what he observed himself, or had been told him by others;\\nhowever, I could not reflect without some amazement, and much sorrow,\\nthat the rudiments of lewdness, coquetry, censure, and scandal, should\\nhave place by instinct in womankind.\\n\\nI expected every moment that my master would accuse the _Yahoos_ of those\\nunnatural appetites in both sexes, so common among us.  But nature, it\\nseems, has not been so expert a school-mistress; and these politer\\npleasures are entirely the productions of art and reason on our side of\\nthe globe.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\n\\nThe author relates several particulars of the _Yahoos_.  The great\\nvirtues of the _Houyhnhnms_.  The education and exercise of their youth.\\nTheir general assembly.\\n\\nAs I ought to have understood human nature much better than I supposed it\\npossible for my master to do, so it was easy to apply the character he\\ngave of the _Yahoos_ to myself and my countrymen; and I believed I could\\nyet make further discoveries, from my own observation.  I therefore often\\nbegged his honour to let me go among the herds of _Yahoos_ in the\\nneighbourhood; to which he always very graciously consented, being\\nperfectly convinced that the hatred I bore these brutes would never\\nsuffer me to be corrupted by them; and his honour ordered one of his\\nservants, a strong sorrel nag, very honest and good-natured, to be my\\nguard; without whose protection I durst not undertake such adventures.\\nFor I have already told the reader how much I was pestered by these\\nodious animals, upon my first arrival; and I afterwards failed very\\nnarrowly, three or four times, of falling into their clutches, when I\\nhappened to stray at any distance without my hanger.  And I have reason\\nto believe they had some imagination that I was of their own species,\\nwhich I often assisted myself by stripping up my sleeves, and showing my\\nnaked arms and breasts in their sight, when my protector was with me.  At\\nwhich times they would approach as near as they durst, and imitate my\\nactions after the manner of monkeys, but ever with great signs of hatred;\\nas a tame jackdaw with cap and stockings is always persecuted by the wild\\nones, when he happens to be got among them.\\n\\nThey are prodigiously nimble from their infancy.  However, I once caught\\na young male of three years old, and endeavoured, by all marks of\\ntenderness, to make it quiet; but the little imp fell a squalling, and\\nscratching, and biting with such violence, that I was forced to let it\\ngo; and it was high time, for a whole troop of old ones came about us at\\nthe noise, but finding the cub was safe (for away it ran), and my sorrel\\nnag being by, they durst not venture near us.  I observed the young\\nanimal’s flesh to smell very rank, and the stink was somewhat between a\\nweasel and a fox, but much more disagreeable.  I forgot another\\ncircumstance (and perhaps I might have the reader’s pardon if it were\\nwholly omitted), that while I held the odious vermin in my hands, it\\nvoided its filthy excrements of a yellow liquid substance all over my\\nclothes; but by good fortune there was a small brook hard by, where I\\nwashed myself as clean as I could; although I durst not come into my\\nmaster’s presence until I were sufficiently aired.\\n\\nBy what I could discover, the _Yahoos_ appear to be the most unteachable\\nof all animals: their capacity never reaching higher than to draw or\\ncarry burdens.  Yet I am of opinion, this defect arises chiefly from a\\nperverse, restive disposition; for they are cunning, malicious,\\ntreacherous, and revengeful.  They are strong and hardy, but of a\\ncowardly spirit, and, by consequence, insolent, abject, and cruel.  It is\\nobserved, that the red haired of both sexes are more libidinous and\\nmischievous than the rest, whom yet they much exceed in strength and\\nactivity.\\n\\nThe _Houyhnhnms_ keep the _Yahoos_ for present use in huts not far from\\nthe house; but the rest are sent abroad to certain fields, where they dig\\nup roots, eat several kinds of herbs, and search about for carrion, or\\nsometimes catch weasels and _luhimuhs_ (a sort of wild rat), which they\\ngreedily devour.  Nature has taught them to dig deep holes with their\\nnails on the side of a rising ground, wherein they lie by themselves;\\nonly the kennels of the females are larger, sufficient to hold two or\\nthree cubs.\\n\\nThey swim from their infancy like frogs, and are able to continue long\\nunder water, where they often take fish, which the females carry home to\\ntheir young.  And, upon this occasion, I hope the reader will pardon my\\nrelating an odd adventure.\\n\\nBeing one day abroad with my protector the sorrel nag, and the weather\\nexceeding hot, I entreated him to let me bathe in a river that was near.\\nHe consented, and I immediately stripped myself stark naked, and went\\ndown softly into the stream.  It happened that a young female _Yahoo_,\\nstanding behind a bank, saw the whole proceeding, and inflamed by desire,\\nas the nag and I conjectured, came running with all speed, and leaped\\ninto the water, within five yards of the place where I bathed.  I was\\nnever in my life so terribly frightened.  The nag was grazing at some\\ndistance, not suspecting any harm.  She embraced me after a most fulsome\\nmanner.  I roared as loud as I could, and the nag came galloping towards\\nme, whereupon she quitted her grasp, with the utmost reluctancy, and\\nleaped upon the opposite bank, where she stood gazing and howling all the\\ntime I was putting on my clothes.\\n\\nThis was a matter of diversion to my master and his family, as well as of\\nmortification to myself.  For now I could no longer deny that I was a\\nreal _Yahoo_ in every limb and feature, since the females had a natural\\npropensity to me, as one of their own species.  Neither was the hair of\\nthis brute of a red colour (which might have been some excuse for an\\nappetite a little irregular), but black as a sloe, and her countenance\\ndid not make an appearance altogether so hideous as the rest of her kind;\\nfor I think she could not be above eleven years old.\\n\\nHaving lived three years in this country, the reader, I suppose, will\\nexpect that I should, like other travellers, give him some account of the\\nmanners and customs of its inhabitants, which it was indeed my principal\\nstudy to learn.\\n\\nAs these noble _Houyhnhnms_ are endowed by nature with a general\\ndisposition to all virtues, and have no conceptions or ideas of what is\\nevil in a rational creature, so their grand maxim is, to cultivate\\nreason, and to be wholly governed by it.  Neither is reason among them a\\npoint problematical, as with us, where men can argue with plausibility on\\nboth sides of the question, but strikes you with immediate conviction; as\\nit must needs do, where it is not mingled, obscured, or discoloured, by\\npassion and interest.  I remember it was with extreme difficulty that I\\ncould bring my master to understand the meaning of the word opinion, or\\nhow a point could be disputable; because reason taught us to affirm or\\ndeny only where we are certain; and beyond our knowledge we cannot do\\neither.  So that controversies, wranglings, disputes, and positiveness,\\nin false or dubious propositions, are evils unknown among the\\n_Houyhnhnms_.  In the like manner, when I used to explain to him our\\nseveral systems of natural philosophy, he would laugh, “that a creature\\npretending to reason, should value itself upon the knowledge of other\\npeople’s conjectures, and in things where that knowledge, if it were\\ncertain, could be of no use.”  Wherein he agreed entirely with the\\nsentiments of Socrates, as Plato delivers them; which I mention as the\\nhighest honour I can do that prince of philosophers.  I have often since\\nreflected, what destruction such doctrine would make in the libraries of\\nEurope; and how many paths of fame would be then shut up in the learned\\nworld.\\n\\nFriendship and benevolence are the two principal virtues among the\\n_Houyhnhnms_; and these not confined to particular objects, but universal\\nto the whole race; for a stranger from the remotest part is equally\\ntreated with the nearest neighbour, and wherever he goes, looks upon\\nhimself as at home.  They preserve decency and civility in the highest\\ndegrees, but are altogether ignorant of ceremony.  They have no fondness\\nfor their colts or foals, but the care they take in educating them\\nproceeds entirely from the dictates of reason.  And I observed my master\\nto show the same affection to his neighbour’s issue, that he had for his\\nown.  They will have it that nature teaches them to love the whole\\nspecies, and it is reason only that makes a distinction of persons, where\\nthere is a superior degree of virtue.\\n\\nWhen the matron _Houyhnhnms_ have produced one of each sex, they no\\nlonger accompany with their consorts, except they lose one of their issue\\nby some casualty, which very seldom happens; but in such a case they meet\\nagain; or when the like accident befalls a person whose wife is past\\nbearing, some other couple bestow on him one of their own colts, and then\\ngo together again until the mother is pregnant.  This caution is\\nnecessary, to prevent the country from being overburdened with numbers.\\nBut the race of inferior _Houyhnhnms_, bred up to be servants, is not so\\nstrictly limited upon this article: these are allowed to produce three of\\neach sex, to be domestics in the noble families.\\n\\nIn their marriages, they are exactly careful to choose such colours as\\nwill not make any disagreeable mixture in the breed.  Strength is chiefly\\nvalued in the male, and comeliness in the female; not upon the account of\\nlove, but to preserve the race from degenerating; for where a female\\nhappens to excel in strength, a consort is chosen, with regard to\\ncomeliness.\\n\\nCourtship, love, presents, jointures, settlements have no place in their\\nthoughts, or terms whereby to express them in their language.  The young\\ncouple meet, and are joined, merely because it is the determination of\\ntheir parents and friends; it is what they see done every day, and they\\nlook upon it as one of the necessary actions of a reasonable being.  But\\nthe violation of marriage, or any other unchastity, was never heard of;\\nand the married pair pass their lives with the same friendship and mutual\\nbenevolence, that they bear to all others of the same species who come in\\ntheir way, without jealousy, fondness, quarrelling, or discontent.\\n\\nIn educating the youth of both sexes, their method is admirable, and\\nhighly deserves our imitation.  These are not suffered to taste a grain\\nof oats, except upon certain days, till eighteen years old; nor milk, but\\nvery rarely; and in summer they graze two hours in the morning, and as\\nmany in the evening, which their parents likewise observe; but the\\nservants are not allowed above half that time, and a great part of their\\ngrass is brought home, which they eat at the most convenient hours, when\\nthey can be best spared from work.\\n\\nTemperance, industry, exercise, and cleanliness, are the lessons equally\\nenjoined to the young ones of both sexes: and my master thought it\\nmonstrous in us, to give the females a different kind of education from\\nthe males, except in some articles of domestic management; whereby, as he\\ntruly observed, one half of our natives were good for nothing but\\nbringing children into the world; and to trust the care of our children\\nto such useless animals, he said, was yet a greater instance of\\nbrutality.\\n\\nBut the _Houyhnhnms_ train up their youth to strength, speed, and\\nhardiness, by exercising them in running races up and down steep hills,\\nand over hard stony grounds; and when they are all in a sweat, they are\\nordered to leap over head and ears into a pond or river.  Four times a\\nyear the youth of a certain district meet to show their proficiency in\\nrunning and leaping, and other feats of strength and agility; where the\\nvictor is rewarded with a song in his or her praise.  On this festival,\\nthe servants drive a herd of _Yahoos_ into the field, laden with hay, and\\noats, and milk, for a repast to the _Houyhnhnms_; after which, these\\nbrutes are immediately driven back again, for fear of being noisome to\\nthe assembly.\\n\\nEvery fourth year, at the vernal equinox, there is a representative\\ncouncil of the whole nation, which meets in a plain about twenty miles\\nfrom our house, and continues about five or six days.  Here they inquire\\ninto the state and condition of the several districts; whether they\\nabound or be deficient in hay or oats, or cows, or _Yahoos_; and wherever\\nthere is any want (which is but seldom) it is immediately supplied by\\nunanimous consent and contribution.  Here likewise the regulation of\\nchildren is settled: as for instance, if a _Houyhnhnm_ has two males, he\\nchanges one of them with another that has two females; and when a child\\nhas been lost by any casualty, where the mother is past breeding, it is\\ndetermined what family in the district shall breed another to supply the\\nloss.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\n\\n\\nA grand debate at the general assembly of the _Houyhnhnms_, and how it\\nwas determined.  The learning of the _Houyhnhnms_.  Their buildings.\\nTheir manner of burials.  The defectiveness of their language.\\n\\nOne of these grand assemblies was held in my time, about three months\\nbefore my departure, whither my master went as the representative of our\\ndistrict.  In this council was resumed their old debate, and indeed the\\nonly debate that ever happened in their country; whereof my master, after\\nhis return, give me a very particular account.\\n\\nThe question to be debated was, “whether the _Yahoos_ should be\\nexterminated from the face of the earth?”  One of the members for the\\naffirmative offered several arguments of great strength and weight,\\nalleging, “that as the _Yahoos_ were the most filthy, noisome, and\\ndeformed animals which nature ever produced, so they were the most\\nrestive and indocible, mischievous and malicious; they would privately\\nsuck the teats of the _Houyhnhnms’_ cows, kill and devour their cats,\\ntrample down their oats and grass, if they were not continually watched,\\nand commit a thousand other extravagancies.”  He took notice of a general\\ntradition, “that _Yahoos_ had not been always in their country; but that\\nmany ages ago, two of these brutes appeared together upon a mountain;\\nwhether produced by the heat of the sun upon corrupted mud and slime, or\\nfrom the ooze and froth of the sea, was never known; that these _Yahoos_\\nengendered, and their brood, in a short time, grew so numerous as to\\noverrun and infest the whole nation; that the _Houyhnhnms_, to get rid of\\nthis evil, made a general hunting, and at last enclosed the whole herd;\\nand destroying the elder, every _Houyhnhnm_ kept two young ones in a\\nkennel, and brought them to such a degree of tameness, as an animal, so\\nsavage by nature, can be capable of acquiring, using them for draught and\\ncarriage; that there seemed to be much truth in this tradition, and that\\nthose creatures could not be _yinhniamshy_ (or _aborigines_ of the land),\\nbecause of the violent hatred the _Houyhnhnms_, as well as all other\\nanimals, bore them, which, although their evil disposition sufficiently\\ndeserved, could never have arrived at so high a degree if they had been\\n_aborigines_, or else they would have long since been rooted out; that\\nthe inhabitants, taking a fancy to use the service of the _Yahoos_, had,\\nvery imprudently, neglected to cultivate the breed of asses, which are a\\ncomely animal, easily kept, more tame and orderly, without any offensive\\nsmell, strong enough for labour, although they yield to the other in\\nagility of body, and if their braying be no agreeable sound, it is far\\npreferable to the horrible howlings of the _Yahoos_.”\\n\\nSeveral others declared their sentiments to the same purpose, when my\\nmaster proposed an expedient to the assembly, whereof he had indeed\\nborrowed the hint from me.  “He approved of the tradition mentioned by\\nthe honourable member who spoke before, and affirmed, that the two\\n_Yahoos_ said to be seen first among them, had been driven thither over\\nthe sea; that coming to land, and being forsaken by their companions,\\nthey retired to the mountains, and degenerating by degrees, became in\\nprocess of time much more savage than those of their own species in the\\ncountry whence these two originals came.  The reason of this assertion\\nwas, that he had now in his possession a certain wonderful _Yahoo_\\n(meaning myself) which most of them had heard of, and many of them had\\nseen.  He then related to them how he first found me; that my body was\\nall covered with an artificial composure of the skins and hairs of other\\nanimals; that I spoke in a language of my own, and had thoroughly learned\\ntheirs; that I had related to him the accidents which brought me thither;\\nthat when he saw me without my covering, I was an exact _Yahoo_ in every\\npart, only of a whiter colour, less hairy, and with shorter claws.  He\\nadded, how I had endeavoured to persuade him, that in my own and other\\ncountries, the _Yahoos_ acted as the governing, rational animal, and held\\nthe _Houyhnhnms_ in servitude; that he observed in me all the qualities\\nof a _Yahoo_, only a little more civilized by some tincture of reason,\\nwhich, however, was in a degree as far inferior to the _Houyhnhnm_ race,\\nas the _Yahoos_ of their country were to me; that, among other things, I\\nmentioned a custom we had of castrating _Houyhnhnms_ when they were\\nyoung, in order to render them tame; that the operation was easy and\\nsafe; that it was no shame to learn wisdom from brutes, as industry is\\ntaught by the ant, and building by the swallow (for so I translate the\\nword _lyhannh_, although it be a much larger fowl); that this invention\\nmight be practised upon the younger _Yahoos_ here, which besides\\nrendering them tractable and fitter for use, would in an age put an end\\nto the whole species, without destroying life; that in the mean time the\\n_Houyhnhnms_ should be exhorted to cultivate the breed of asses, which,\\nas they are in all respects more valuable brutes, so they have this\\nadvantage, to be fit for service at five years old, which the others are\\nnot till twelve.”\\n\\nThis was all my master thought fit to tell me, at that time, of what\\npassed in the grand council.  But he was pleased to conceal one\\nparticular, which related personally to myself, whereof I soon felt the\\nunhappy effect, as the reader will know in its proper place, and whence I\\ndate all the succeeding misfortunes of my life.\\n\\nThe _Houyhnhnms_ have no letters, and consequently their knowledge is all\\ntraditional.  But there happening few events of any moment among a people\\nso well united, naturally disposed to every virtue, wholly governed by\\nreason, and cut off from all commerce with other nations, the historical\\npart is easily preserved without burdening their memories.  I have\\nalready observed that they are subject to no diseases, and therefore can\\nhave no need of physicians.  However, they have excellent medicines,\\ncomposed of herbs, to cure accidental bruises and cuts in the pastern or\\nfrog of the foot, by sharp stones, as well as other maims and hurts in\\nthe several parts of the body.\\n\\nThey calculate the year by the revolution of the sun and moon, but use no\\nsubdivisions into weeks.  They are well enough acquainted with the\\nmotions of those two luminaries, and understand the nature of eclipses;\\nand this is the utmost progress of their astronomy.\\n\\nIn poetry, they must be allowed to excel all other mortals; wherein the\\njustness of their similes, and the minuteness as well as exactness of\\ntheir descriptions, are indeed inimitable.  Their verses abound very much\\nin both of these, and usually contain either some exalted notions of\\nfriendship and benevolence or the praises of those who were victors in\\nraces and other bodily exercises.  Their buildings, although very rude\\nand simple, are not inconvenient, but well contrived to defend them from\\nall injuries of cold and heat.  They have a kind of tree, which at forty\\nyears old loosens in the root, and falls with the first storm: it grows\\nvery straight, and being pointed like stakes with a sharp stone (for the\\n_Houyhnhnms_ know not the use of iron), they stick them erect in the\\nground, about ten inches asunder, and then weave in oat straw, or\\nsometimes wattles, between them.  The roof is made after the same manner,\\nand so are the doors.\\n\\nThe _Houyhnhnms_ use the hollow part, between the pastern and the hoof of\\ntheir fore-foot, as we do our hands, and this with greater dexterity than\\nI could at first imagine.  I have seen a white mare of our family thread\\na needle (which I lent her on purpose) with that joint.  They milk their\\ncows, reap their oats, and do all the work which requires hands, in the\\nsame manner.  They have a kind of hard flints, which, by grinding against\\nother stones, they form into instruments, that serve instead of wedges,\\naxes, and hammers.  With tools made of these flints, they likewise cut\\ntheir hay, and reap their oats, which there grow naturally in several\\nfields; the _Yahoos_ draw home the sheaves in carriages, and the servants\\ntread them in certain covered huts to get out the grain, which is kept in\\nstores.  They make a rude kind of earthen and wooden vessels, and bake\\nthe former in the sun.\\n\\nIf they can avoid casualties, they die only of old age, and are buried in\\nthe obscurest places that can be found, their friends and relations\\nexpressing neither joy nor grief at their departure; nor does the dying\\nperson discover the least regret that he is leaving the world, any more\\nthan if he were upon returning home from a visit to one of his\\nneighbours.  I remember my master having once made an appointment with a\\nfriend and his family to come to his house, upon some affair of\\nimportance: on the day fixed, the mistress and her two children came very\\nlate; she made two excuses, first for her husband, who, as she said,\\nhappened that very morning to _shnuwnh_.  The word is strongly expressive\\nin their language, but not easily rendered into English; it signifies,\\n“to retire to his first mother.”  Her excuse for not coming sooner, was,\\nthat her husband dying late in the morning, she was a good while\\nconsulting her servants about a convenient place where his body should be\\nlaid; and I observed, she behaved herself at our house as cheerfully as\\nthe rest.  She died about three months after.\\n\\nThey live generally to seventy, or seventy-five years, very seldom to\\nfourscore.  Some weeks before their death, they feel a gradual decay; but\\nwithout pain.  During this time they are much visited by their friends,\\nbecause they cannot go abroad with their usual ease and satisfaction.\\nHowever, about ten days before their death, which they seldom fail in\\ncomputing, they return the visits that have been made them by those who\\nare nearest in the neighbourhood, being carried in a convenient sledge\\ndrawn by _Yahoos_; which vehicle they use, not only upon this occasion,\\nbut when they grow old, upon long journeys, or when they are lamed by any\\naccident: and therefore when the dying _Houyhnhnms_ return those visits,\\nthey take a solemn leave of their friends, as if they were going to some\\nremote part of the country, where they designed to pass the rest of their\\nlives.\\n\\nI know not whether it may be worth observing, that the _Houyhnhnms_ have\\nno word in their language to express any thing that is evil, except what\\nthey borrow from the deformities or ill qualities of the _Yahoos_.  Thus\\nthey denote the folly of a servant, an omission of a child, a stone that\\ncuts their feet, a continuance of foul or unseasonable weather, and the\\nlike, by adding to each the epithet of _Yahoo_.  For instance, _hhnm\\nYahoo_; _whnaholm Yahoo_, _ynlhmndwihlma Yahoo_, and an ill-contrived\\nhouse _ynholmhnmrohlnw Yahoo_.\\n\\nI could, with great pleasure, enlarge further upon the manners and\\nvirtues of this excellent people; but intending in a short time to\\npublish a volume by itself, expressly upon that subject, I refer the\\nreader thither; and, in the mean time, proceed to relate my own sad\\ncatastrophe.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\n\\n\\nThe author’s economy, and happy life, among the Houyhnhnms.  His great\\nimprovement in virtue by conversing with them.  Their conversations.  The\\nauthor has notice given him by his master, that he must depart from the\\ncountry.  He falls into a swoon for grief; but submits.  He contrives and\\nfinishes a canoe by the help of a fellow-servant, and puts to sea at a\\nventure.\\n\\nI had settled my little economy to my own heart’s content.  My master had\\nordered a room to be made for me, after their manner, about six yards\\nfrom the house: the sides and floors of which I plastered with clay, and\\ncovered with rush-mats of my own contriving.  I had beaten hemp, which\\nthere grows wild, and made of it a sort of ticking; this I filled with\\nthe feathers of several birds I had taken with springes made of _Yahoos’_\\nhairs, and were excellent food.  I had worked two chairs with my knife,\\nthe sorrel nag helping me in the grosser and more laborious part.  When\\nmy clothes were worn to rags, I made myself others with the skins of\\nrabbits, and of a certain beautiful animal, about the same size, called\\n_nnuhnoh_, the skin of which is covered with a fine down.  Of these I\\nalso made very tolerable stockings.  I soled my shoes with wood, which I\\ncut from a tree, and fitted to the upper-leather; and when this was worn\\nout, I supplied it with the skins of _Yahoos_ dried in the sun.  I often\\ngot honey out of hollow trees, which I mingled with water, or ate with my\\nbread.  No man could more verify the truth of these two maxims, “That\\nnature is very easily satisfied;” and, “That necessity is the mother of\\ninvention.”  I enjoyed perfect health of body, and tranquillity of mind;\\nI did not feel the treachery or inconstancy of a friend, nor the injuries\\nof a secret or open enemy.  I had no occasion of bribing, flattering, or\\npimping, to procure the favour of any great man, or of his minion; I\\nwanted no fence against fraud or oppression: here was neither physician\\nto destroy my body, nor lawyer to ruin my fortune; no informer to watch\\nmy words and actions, or forge accusations against me for hire: here were\\nno gibers, censurers, backbiters, pickpockets, highwaymen, housebreakers,\\nattorneys, bawds, buffoons, gamesters, politicians, wits, splenetics,\\ntedious talkers, controvertists, ravishers, murderers, robbers,\\nvirtuosos; no leaders, or followers, of party and faction; no encouragers\\nto vice, by seducement or examples; no dungeon, axes, gibbets,\\nwhipping-posts, or pillories; no cheating shopkeepers or mechanics; no\\npride, vanity, or affectation; no fops, bullies, drunkards, strolling\\nwhores, or poxes; no ranting, lewd, expensive wives; no stupid, proud\\npedants; no importunate, overbearing, quarrelsome, noisy, roaring, empty,\\nconceited, swearing companions; no scoundrels raised from the dust upon\\nthe merit of their vices, or nobility thrown into it on account of their\\nvirtues; no lords, fiddlers, judges, or dancing-masters.\\n\\nI had the favour of being admitted to several _Houyhnhnms_, who came to\\nvisit or dine with my master; where his honour graciously suffered me to\\nwait in the room, and listen to their discourse.  Both he and his company\\nwould often descend to ask me questions, and receive my answers.  I had\\nalso sometimes the honour of attending my master in his visits to others.\\nI never presumed to speak, except in answer to a question; and then I did\\nit with inward regret, because it was a loss of so much time for\\nimproving myself; but I was infinitely delighted with the station of an\\nhumble auditor in such conversations, where nothing passed but what was\\nuseful, expressed in the fewest and most significant words; where, as I\\nhave already said, the greatest decency was observed, without the least\\ndegree of ceremony; where no person spoke without being pleased himself,\\nand pleasing his companions; where there was no interruption,\\ntediousness, heat, or difference of sentiments.  They have a notion, that\\nwhen people are met together, a short silence does much improve\\nconversation: this I found to be true; for during those little\\nintermissions of talk, new ideas would arise in their minds, which very\\nmuch enlivened the discourse.  Their subjects are, generally on\\nfriendship and benevolence, on order and economy; sometimes upon the\\nvisible operations of nature, or ancient traditions; upon the bounds and\\nlimits of virtue; upon the unerring rules of reason, or upon some\\ndeterminations to be taken at the next great assembly: and often upon the\\nvarious excellences of poetry.  I may add, without vanity, that my\\npresence often gave them sufficient matter for discourse, because it\\nafforded my master an occasion of letting his friends into the history of\\nme and my country, upon which they were all pleased to descant, in a\\nmanner not very advantageous to humankind: and for that reason I shall\\nnot repeat what they said; only I may be allowed to observe, that his\\nhonour, to my great admiration, appeared to understand the nature of\\n_Yahoos_ much better than myself.  He went through all our vices and\\nfollies, and discovered many, which I had never mentioned to him, by only\\nsupposing what qualities a _Yahoo_ of their country, with a small\\nproportion of reason, might be capable of exerting; and concluded, with\\ntoo much probability, “how vile, as well as miserable, such a creature\\nmust be.”\\n\\nI freely confess, that all the little knowledge I have of any value, was\\nacquired by the lectures I received from my master, and from hearing the\\ndiscourses of him and his friends; to which I should be prouder to\\nlisten, than to dictate to the greatest and wisest assembly in Europe.  I\\nadmired the strength, comeliness, and speed of the inhabitants; and such\\na constellation of virtues, in such amiable persons, produced in me the\\nhighest veneration.  At first, indeed, I did not feel that natural awe,\\nwhich the _Yahoos_ and all other animals bear toward them; but it grew\\nupon me by decrees, much sooner than I imagined, and was mingled with a\\nrespectful love and gratitude, that they would condescend to distinguish\\nme from the rest of my species.\\n\\nWhen I thought of my family, my friends, my countrymen, or the human race\\nin general, I considered them, as they really were, _Yahoos_ in shape and\\ndisposition, perhaps a little more civilized, and qualified with the gift\\nof speech; but making no other use of reason, than to improve and\\nmultiply those vices whereof their brethren in this country had only the\\nshare that nature allotted them.  When I happened to behold the\\nreflection of my own form in a lake or fountain, I turned away my face in\\nhorror and detestation of myself, and could better endure the sight of a\\ncommon _Yahoo_ than of my own person.  By conversing with the\\n_Houyhnhnms_, and looking upon them with delight, I fell to imitate their\\ngait and gesture, which is now grown into a habit; and my friends often\\ntell me, in a blunt way, “that I trot like a horse;” which, however, I\\ntake for a great compliment.  Neither shall I disown, that in speaking I\\nam apt to fall into the voice and manner of the _Houyhnhnms_, and hear\\nmyself ridiculed on that account, without the least mortification.\\n\\nIn the midst of all this happiness, and when I looked upon myself to be\\nfully settled for life, my master sent for me one morning a little\\nearlier than his usual hour.  I observed by his countenance that he was\\nin some perplexity, and at a loss how to begin what he had to speak.\\nAfter a short silence, he told me, “he did not know how I would take what\\nhe was going to say: that in the last general assembly, when the affair\\nof the _Yahoos_ was entered upon, the representatives had taken offence\\nat his keeping a _Yahoo_ (meaning myself) in his family, more like a\\n_Houyhnhnm_ than a brute animal; that he was known frequently to converse\\nwith me, as if he could receive some advantage or pleasure in my company;\\nthat such a practice was not agreeable to reason or nature, or a thing\\never heard of before among them; the assembly did therefore exhort him\\neither to employ me like the rest of my species, or command me to swim\\nback to the place whence I came: that the first of these expedients was\\nutterly rejected by all the _Houyhnhnms_ who had ever seen me at his\\nhouse or their own; for they alleged, that because I had some rudiments\\nof reason, added to the natural pravity of those animals, it was to be\\nfeared I might be able to seduce them into the woody and mountainous\\nparts of the country, and bring them in troops by night to destroy the\\n_Houyhnhnms’_ cattle, as being naturally of the ravenous kind, and averse\\nfrom labour.”\\n\\nMy master added, “that he was daily pressed by the _Houyhnhnms_ of the\\nneighbourhood to have the assembly’s exhortation executed, which he could\\nnot put off much longer.  He doubted it would be impossible for me to\\nswim to another country; and therefore wished I would contrive some sort\\nof vehicle, resembling those I had described to him, that might carry me\\non the sea; in which work I should have the assistance of his own\\nservants, as well as those of his neighbours.”  He concluded, “that for\\nhis own part, he could have been content to keep me in his service as\\nlong as I lived; because he found I had cured myself of some bad habits\\nand dispositions, by endeavouring, as far as my inferior nature was\\ncapable, to imitate the _Houyhnhnms_.”\\n\\nI should here observe to the reader, that a decree of the general\\nassembly in this country is expressed by the word _hnhloayn_, which\\nsignifies an exhortation, as near as I can render it; for they have no\\nconception how a rational creature can be compelled, but only advised, or\\nexhorted; because no person can disobey reason, without giving up his\\nclaim to be a rational creature.\\n\\nI was struck with the utmost grief and despair at my master’s discourse;\\nand being unable to support the agonies I was under, I fell into a swoon\\nat his feet.  When I came to myself, he told me “that he concluded I had\\nbeen dead;” for these people are subject to no such imbecilities of\\nnature.  I answered in a faint voice, “that death would have been too\\ngreat a happiness; that although I could not blame the assembly’s\\nexhortation, or the urgency of his friends; yet, in my weak and corrupt\\njudgment, I thought it might consist with reason to have been less\\nrigorous; that I could not swim a league, and probably the nearest land\\nto theirs might be distant above a hundred: that many materials,\\nnecessary for making a small vessel to carry me off, were wholly wanting\\nin this country; which, however, I would attempt, in obedience and\\ngratitude to his honour, although I concluded the thing to be impossible,\\nand therefore looked on myself as already devoted to destruction; that\\nthe certain prospect of an unnatural death was the least of my evils;\\nfor, supposing I should escape with life by some strange adventure, how\\ncould I think with temper of passing my days among _Yahoos_, and\\nrelapsing into my old corruptions, for want of examples to lead and keep\\nme within the paths of virtue? that I knew too well upon what solid\\nreasons all the determinations of the wise _Houyhnhnms_ were founded, not\\nto be shaken by arguments of mine, a miserable _Yahoo_; and therefore,\\nafter presenting him with my humble thanks for the offer of his servants’\\nassistance in making a vessel, and desiring a reasonable time for so\\ndifficult a work, I told him I would endeavour to preserve a wretched\\nbeing; and if ever I returned to England, was not without hopes of being\\nuseful to my own species, by celebrating the praises of the renowned\\n_Houyhnhnms_, and proposing their virtues to the imitation of mankind.”\\n\\nMy master, in a few words, made me a very gracious reply; allowed me the\\nspace of two months to finish my boat; and ordered the sorrel nag, my\\nfellow-servant (for so, at this distance, I may presume to call him), to\\nfollow my instruction; because I told my master, “that his help would be\\nsufficient, and I knew he had a tenderness for me.”\\n\\nIn his company, my first business was to go to that part of the coast\\nwhere my rebellious crew had ordered me to be set on shore.  I got upon a\\nheight, and looking on every side into the sea; fancied I saw a small\\nisland toward the north-east.  I took out my pocket glass, and could then\\nclearly distinguish it above five leagues off, as I computed; but it\\nappeared to the sorrel nag to be only a blue cloud: for as he had no\\nconception of any country beside his own, so he could not be as expert in\\ndistinguishing remote objects at sea, as we who so much converse in that\\nelement.\\n\\nAfter I had discovered this island, I considered no further; but resolved\\nit should if possible, be the first place of my banishment, leaving the\\nconsequence to fortune.\\n\\nI returned home, and consulting with the sorrel nag, we went into a copse\\nat some distance, where I with my knife, and he with a sharp flint,\\nfastened very artificially after their manner, to a wooden handle, cut\\ndown several oak wattles, about the thickness of a walking-staff, and\\nsome larger pieces.  But I shall not trouble the reader with a particular\\ndescription of my own mechanics; let it suffice to say, that in six weeks\\ntime with the help of the sorrel nag, who performed the parts that\\nrequired most labour, I finished a sort of Indian canoe, but much larger,\\ncovering it with the skins of _Yahoos_, well stitched together with\\nhempen threads of my own making.  My sail was likewise composed of the\\nskins of the same animal; but I made use of the youngest I could get, the\\nolder being too tough and thick; and I likewise provided myself with four\\npaddles.  I laid in a stock of boiled flesh, of rabbits and fowls, and\\ntook with me two vessels, one filled with milk and the other with water.\\n\\nI tried my canoe in a large pond, near my master’s house, and then\\ncorrected in it what was amiss; stopping all the chinks with _Yahoos’_\\ntallow, till I found it staunch, and able to bear me and my freight; and,\\nwhen it was as complete as I could possibly make it, I had it drawn on a\\ncarriage very gently by _Yahoos_ to the sea-side, under the conduct of\\nthe sorrel nag and another servant.\\n\\nWhen all was ready, and the day came for my departure, I took leave of my\\nmaster and lady and the whole family, my eyes flowing with tears, and my\\nheart quite sunk with grief.  But his honour, out of curiosity, and,\\nperhaps, (if I may speak without vanity,) partly out of kindness, was\\ndetermined to see me in my canoe, and got several of his neighbouring\\nfriends to accompany him.  I was forced to wait above an hour for the\\ntide; and then observing the wind very fortunately bearing toward the\\nisland to which I intended to steer my course, I took a second leave of\\nmy master: but as I was going to prostrate myself to kiss his hoof, he\\ndid me the honour to raise it gently to my mouth.  I am not ignorant how\\nmuch I have been censured for mentioning this last particular.\\nDetractors are pleased to think it improbable, that so illustrious a\\nperson should descend to give so great a mark of distinction to a\\ncreature so inferior as I.  Neither have I forgotten how apt some\\ntravellers are to boast of extraordinary favours they have received.\\nBut, if these censurers were better acquainted with the noble and\\ncourteous disposition of the _Houyhnhnms_, they would soon change their\\nopinion.\\n\\nI paid my respects to the rest of the _Houyhnhnms_ in his honour’s\\ncompany; then getting into my canoe, I pushed off from shore.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\n\\nThe author’s dangerous voyage.  He arrives at New Holland, hoping to\\nsettle there.  Is wounded with an arrow by one of the natives.  Is seized\\nand carried by force into a Portuguese ship.  The great civilities of the\\ncaptain.  The author arrives at England.\\n\\nI began this desperate voyage on February 15, 1714–15, at nine o’clock in\\nthe morning.  The wind was very favourable; however, I made use at first\\nonly of my paddles; but considering I should soon be weary, and that the\\nwind might chop about, I ventured to set up my little sail; and thus,\\nwith the help of the tide, I went at the rate of a league and a half an\\nhour, as near as I could guess.  My master and his friends continued on\\nthe shore till I was almost out of sight; and I often heard the sorrel\\nnag (who always loved me) crying out, “_Hnuy illa nyha_, _majah Yahoo_;”\\n“Take care of thyself, gentle _Yahoo_.”\\n\\nMy design was, if possible, to discover some small island uninhabited,\\nyet sufficient, by my labour, to furnish me with the necessaries of life,\\nwhich I would have thought a greater happiness, than to be first minister\\nin the politest court of Europe; so horrible was the idea I conceived of\\nreturning to live in the society, and under the government of _Yahoos_.\\nFor in such a solitude as I desired, I could at least enjoy my own\\nthoughts, and reflect with delight on the virtues of those inimitable\\n_Houyhnhnms_, without an opportunity of degenerating into the vices and\\ncorruptions of my own species.\\n\\nThe reader may remember what I related, when my crew conspired against\\nme, and confined me to my cabin; how I continued there several weeks\\nwithout knowing what course we took; and when I was put ashore in the\\nlong-boat, how the sailors told me, with oaths, whether true or false,\\n“that they knew not in what part of the world we were.”  However, I did\\nthen believe us to be about 10 degrees southward of the Cape of Good\\nHope, or about 45 degrees southern latitude, as I gathered from some\\ngeneral words I overheard among them, being I supposed to the south-east\\nin their intended voyage to Madagascar.  And although this were little\\nbetter than conjecture, yet I resolved to steer my course eastward,\\nhoping to reach the south-west coast of New Holland, and perhaps some\\nsuch island as I desired lying westward of it.  The wind was full west,\\nand by six in the evening I computed I had gone eastward at least\\neighteen leagues; when I spied a very small island about half a league\\noff, which I soon reached.  It was nothing but a rock, with one creek\\nnaturally arched by the force of tempests.  Here I put in my canoe, and\\nclimbing a part of the rock, I could plainly discover land to the east,\\nextending from south to north.  I lay all night in my canoe; and\\nrepeating my voyage early in the morning, I arrived in seven hours to the\\nsouth-east point of New Holland.  This confirmed me in the opinion I have\\nlong entertained, that the maps and charts place this country at least\\nthree degrees more to the east than it really is; which thought I\\ncommunicated many years ago to my worthy friend, Mr. Herman Moll, and\\ngave him my reasons for it, although he has rather chosen to follow other\\nauthors.\\n\\nI saw no inhabitants in the place where I landed, and being unarmed, I\\nwas afraid of venturing far into the country.  I found some shellfish on\\nthe shore, and ate them raw, not daring to kindle a fire, for fear of\\nbeing discovered by the natives.  I continued three days feeding on\\noysters and limpets, to save my own provisions; and I fortunately found a\\nbrook of excellent water, which gave me great relief.\\n\\nOn the fourth day, venturing out early a little too far, I saw twenty or\\nthirty natives upon a height not above five hundred yards from me.  They\\nwere stark naked, men, women, and children, round a fire, as I could\\ndiscover by the smoke.  One of them spied me, and gave notice to the\\nrest; five of them advanced toward me, leaving the women and children at\\nthe fire.  I made what haste I could to the shore, and, getting into my\\ncanoe, shoved off: the savages, observing me retreat, ran after me: and\\nbefore I could get far enough into the sea, discharged an arrow which\\nwounded me deeply on the inside of my left knee: I shall carry the mark\\nto my grave.  I apprehended the arrow might be poisoned, and paddling out\\nof the reach of their darts (being a calm day), I made a shift to suck\\nthe wound, and dress it as well as I could.\\n\\nI was at a loss what to do, for I durst not return to the same\\nlanding-place, but stood to the north, and was forced to paddle, for the\\nwind, though very gentle, was against me, blowing north-west.  As I was\\nlooking about for a secure landing-place, I saw a sail to the\\nnorth-north-east, which appearing every minute more visible, I was in\\nsome doubt whether I should wait for them or not; but at last my\\ndetestation of the _Yahoo_ race prevailed: and turning my canoe, I sailed\\nand paddled together to the south, and got into the same creek whence I\\nset out in the morning, choosing rather to trust myself among these\\nbarbarians, than live with European _Yahoos_.  I drew up my canoe as\\nclose as I could to the shore, and hid myself behind a stone by the\\nlittle brook, which, as I have already said, was excellent water.\\n\\nThe ship came within half a league of this creek, and sent her long boat\\nwith vessels to take in fresh water (for the place, it seems, was very\\nwell known); but I did not observe it, till the boat was almost on shore;\\nand it was too late to seek another hiding-place.  The seamen at their\\nlanding observed my canoe, and rummaging it all over, easily conjectured\\nthat the owner could not be far off.  Four of them, well armed, searched\\nevery cranny and lurking-hole, till at last they found me flat on my face\\nbehind the stone.  They gazed awhile in admiration at my strange uncouth\\ndress; my coat made of skins, my wooden-soled shoes, and my furred\\nstockings; whence, however, they concluded, I was not a native of the\\nplace, who all go naked.  One of the seamen, in Portuguese, bid me rise,\\nand asked who I was.  I understood that language very well, and getting\\nupon my feet, said, “I was a poor _Yahoo_ banished from the _Houyhnhnms_,\\nand desired they would please to let me depart.”  They admired to hear me\\nanswer them in their own tongue, and saw by my complexion I must be a\\nEuropean; but were at a loss to know what I meant by _Yahoos_ and\\n_Houyhnhnms_; and at the same time fell a-laughing at my strange tone in\\nspeaking, which resembled the neighing of a horse.  I trembled all the\\nwhile betwixt fear and hatred.  I again desired leave to depart, and was\\ngently moving to my canoe; but they laid hold of me, desiring to know,\\n“what country I was of? whence I came?” with many other questions.  I\\ntold them “I was born in England, whence I came about five years ago, and\\nthen their country and ours were at peace.  I therefore hoped they would\\nnot treat me as an enemy, since I meant them no harm, but was a poor\\n_Yahoo_ seeking some desolate place where to pass the remainder of his\\nunfortunate life.”\\n\\nWhen they began to talk, I thought I never heard or saw any thing more\\nunnatural; for it appeared to me as monstrous as if a dog or a cow should\\nspeak in England, or a _Yahoo_ in _Houyhnhnmland_.  The honest Portuguese\\nwere equally amazed at my strange dress, and the odd manner of delivering\\nmy words, which, however, they understood very well.  They spoke to me\\nwith great humanity, and said, “they were sure the captain would carry me\\n_gratis_ to Lisbon, whence I might return to my own country; that two of\\nthe seamen would go back to the ship, inform the captain of what they had\\nseen, and receive his orders; in the mean time, unless I would give my\\nsolemn oath not to fly, they would secure me by force.  I thought it best\\nto comply with their proposal.  They were very curious to know my story,\\nbut I gave them very little satisfaction, and they all conjectured that\\nmy misfortunes had impaired my reason.  In two hours the boat, which went\\nladen with vessels of water, returned, with the captain’s command to\\nfetch me on board.  I fell on my knees to preserve my liberty; but all\\nwas in vain; and the men, having tied me with cords, heaved me into the\\nboat, whence I was taken into the ship, and thence into the captain’s\\ncabin.\\n\\nHis name was Pedro de Mendez; he was a very courteous and generous\\nperson.  He entreated me to give some account of myself, and desired to\\nknow what I would eat or drink; said, “I should be used as well as\\nhimself;” and spoke so many obliging things, that I wondered to find such\\ncivilities from a _Yahoo_.  However, I remained silent and sullen; I was\\nready to faint at the very smell of him and his men.  At last I desired\\nsomething to eat out of my own canoe; but he ordered me a chicken, and\\nsome excellent wine, and then directed that I should be put to bed in a\\nvery clean cabin.  I would not undress myself, but lay on the\\nbed-clothes, and in half an hour stole out, when I thought the crew was\\nat dinner, and getting to the side of the ship, was going to leap into\\nthe sea, and swim for my life, rather than continue among _Yahoos_.  But\\none of the seamen prevented me, and having informed the captain, I was\\nchained to my cabin.\\n\\nAfter dinner, Don Pedro came to me, and desired to know my reason for so\\ndesperate an attempt; assured me, “he only meant to do me all the service\\nhe was able;” and spoke so very movingly, that at last I descended to\\ntreat him like an animal which had some little portion of reason.  I gave\\nhim a very short relation of my voyage; of the conspiracy against me by\\nmy own men; of the country where they set me on shore, and of my five\\nyears residence there.  All which he looked upon as if it were a dream or\\na vision; whereat I took great offence; for I had quite forgot the\\nfaculty of lying, so peculiar to _Yahoos_, in all countries where they\\npreside, and, consequently, their disposition of suspecting truth in\\nothers of their own species.  I asked him, “whether it were the custom in\\nhis country to say the thing which was not?”  I assured him, “I had\\nalmost forgot what he meant by falsehood, and if I had lived a thousand\\nyears in _Houyhnhnmland_, I should never have heard a lie from the\\nmeanest servant; that I was altogether indifferent whether he believed me\\nor not; but, however, in return for his favours, I would give so much\\nallowance to the corruption of his nature, as to answer any objection he\\nwould please to make, and then he might easily discover the truth.”\\n\\nThe captain, a wise man, after many endeavours to catch me tripping in\\nsome part of my story, at last began to have a better opinion of my\\nveracity.  But he added, “that since I professed so inviolable an\\nattachment to truth, I must give him my word and honour to bear him\\ncompany in this voyage, without attempting any thing against my life; or\\nelse he would continue me a prisoner till we arrived at Lisbon.”  I gave\\nhim the promise he required; but at the same time protested, “that I\\nwould suffer the greatest hardships, rather than return to live among\\n_Yahoos_.”\\n\\nOur voyage passed without any considerable accident.  In gratitude to the\\ncaptain, I sometimes sat with him, at his earnest request, and strove to\\nconceal my antipathy against human kind, although it often broke out;\\nwhich he suffered to pass without observation.  But the greatest part of\\nthe day I confined myself to my cabin, to avoid seeing any of the crew.\\nThe captain had often entreated me to strip myself of my savage dress,\\nand offered to lend me the best suit of clothes he had.  This I would not\\nbe prevailed on to accept, abhorring to cover myself with any thing that\\nhad been on the back of a _Yahoo_.  I only desired he would lend me two\\nclean shirts, which, having been washed since he wore them, I believed\\nwould not so much defile me.  These I changed every second day, and\\nwashed them myself.\\n\\nWe arrived at Lisbon, Nov. 5, 1715.  At our landing, the captain forced\\nme to cover myself with his cloak, to prevent the rabble from crowding\\nabout me.  I was conveyed to his own house; and at my earnest request he\\nled me up to the highest room backwards.  I conjured him “to conceal from\\nall persons what I had told him of the _Houyhnhnms_; because the least\\nhint of such a story would not only draw numbers of people to see me, but\\nprobably put me in danger of being imprisoned, or burnt by the\\nInquisition.”  The captain persuaded me to accept a suit of clothes newly\\nmade; but I would not suffer the tailor to take my measure; however, Don\\nPedro being almost of my size, they fitted me well enough.  He accoutred\\nme with other necessaries, all new, which I aired for twenty-four hours\\nbefore I would use them.\\n\\nThe captain had no wife, nor above three servants, none of which were\\nsuffered to attend at meals; and his whole deportment was so obliging,\\nadded to very good human understanding, that I really began to tolerate\\nhis company.  He gained so far upon me, that I ventured to look out of\\nthe back window.  By degrees I was brought into another room, whence I\\npeeped into the street, but drew my head back in a fright.  In a week’s\\ntime he seduced me down to the door.  I found my terror gradually\\nlessened, but my hatred and contempt seemed to increase.  I was at last\\nbold enough to walk the street in his company, but kept my nose well\\nstopped with rue, or sometimes with tobacco.\\n\\nIn ten days, Don Pedro, to whom I had given some account of my domestic\\naffairs, put it upon me, as a matter of honour and conscience, “that I\\nought to return to my native country, and live at home with my wife and\\nchildren.”  He told me, “there was an English ship in the port just ready\\nto sail, and he would furnish me with all things necessary.”  It would be\\ntedious to repeat his arguments, and my contradictions.  He said, “it was\\naltogether impossible to find such a solitary island as I desired to live\\nin; but I might command in my own house, and pass my time in a manner as\\nrecluse as I pleased.”\\n\\nI complied at last, finding I could not do better.  I left Lisbon the\\n24th day of November, in an English merchantman, but who was the master I\\nnever inquired.  Don Pedro accompanied me to the ship, and lent me twenty\\npounds.  He took kind leave of me, and embraced me at parting, which I\\nbore as well as I could.  During this last voyage I had no commerce with\\nthe master or any of his men; but, pretending I was sick, kept close in\\nmy cabin.  On the fifth of December, 1715, we cast anchor in the Downs,\\nabout nine in the morning, and at three in the afternoon I got safe to my\\nhouse at Rotherhith. {546}\\n\\nMy wife and family received me with great surprise and joy, because they\\nconcluded me certainly dead; but I must freely confess the sight of them\\nfilled me only with hatred, disgust, and contempt; and the more, by\\nreflecting on the near alliance I had to them.  For although, since my\\nunfortunate exile from the _Houyhnhnm_ country, I had compelled myself to\\ntolerate the sight of _Yahoos_, and to converse with Don Pedro de Mendez,\\nyet my memory and imagination were perpetually filled with the virtues\\nand ideas of those exalted _Houyhnhnms_.  And when I began to consider\\nthat, by copulating with one of the _Yahoo_ species I had become a parent\\nof more, it struck me with the utmost shame, confusion, and horror.\\n\\nAs soon as I entered the house, my wife took me in her arms, and kissed\\nme; at which, having not been used to the touch of that odious animal for\\nso many years, I fell into a swoon for almost an hour.  At the time I am\\nwriting, it is five years since my last return to England.  During the\\nfirst year, I could not endure my wife or children in my presence; the\\nvery smell of them was intolerable; much less could I suffer them to eat\\nin the same room.  To this hour they dare not presume to touch my bread,\\nor drink out of the same cup, neither was I ever able to let one of them\\ntake me by the hand.  The first money I laid out was to buy two young\\nstone-horses, which I keep in a good stable; and next to them, the groom\\nis my greatest favourite, for I feel my spirits revived by the smell he\\ncontracts in the stable.  My horses understand me tolerably well; I\\nconverse with them at least four hours every day.  They are strangers to\\nbridle or saddle; they live in great amity with me and friendship to each\\nother.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\n\\n\\nThe author’s veracity.  His design in publishing this work.  His censure\\nof those travellers who swerve from the truth.  The author clears himself\\nfrom any sinister ends in writing.  An objection answered.  The method of\\nplanting colonies.  His native country commended.  The right of the crown\\nto those countries described by the author is justified.  The difficulty\\nof conquering them.  The author takes his last leave of the reader;\\nproposes his manner of living for the future; gives good advice, and\\nconcludes.\\n\\nThus, gentle reader, I have given thee a faithful history of my travels\\nfor sixteen years and above seven months: wherein I have not been so\\nstudious of ornament as of truth.  I could, perhaps, like others, have\\nastonished thee with strange improbable tales; but I rather chose to\\nrelate plain matter of fact, in the simplest manner and style; because my\\nprincipal design was to inform, and not to amuse thee.\\n\\nIt is easy for us who travel into remote countries, which are seldom\\nvisited by Englishmen or other Europeans, to form descriptions of\\nwonderful animals both at sea and land.  Whereas a traveller’s chief aim\\nshould be to make men wiser and better, and to improve their minds by the\\nbad, as well as good, example of what they deliver concerning foreign\\nplaces.\\n\\nI could heartily wish a law was enacted, that every traveller, before he\\nwere permitted to publish his voyages, should be obliged to make oath\\nbefore the Lord High Chancellor, that all he intended to print was\\nabsolutely true to the best of his knowledge; for then the world would no\\nlonger be deceived, as it usually is, while some writers, to make their\\nworks pass the better upon the public, impose the grossest falsities on\\nthe unwary reader.  I have perused several books of travels with great\\ndelight in my younger days; but having since gone over most parts of the\\nglobe, and been able to contradict many fabulous accounts from my own\\nobservation, it has given me a great disgust against this part of\\nreading, and some indignation to see the credulity of mankind so\\nimpudently abused.  Therefore, since my acquaintance were pleased to\\nthink my poor endeavours might not be unacceptable to my country, I\\nimposed on myself, as a maxim never to be swerved from, that I would\\nstrictly adhere to truth; neither indeed can I be ever under the least\\ntemptation to vary from it, while I retain in my mind the lectures and\\nexample of my noble master and the other illustrious _Houyhnhnms_ of whom\\nI had so long the honour to be an humble hearer.\\n\\n    _—Nec si miserum Fortuna Sinonem_\\n    _Finxit_, _vanum etiam_, _mendacemque improba finget_.\\n\\nI know very well, how little reputation is to be got by writings which\\nrequire neither genius nor learning, nor indeed any other talent, except\\na good memory, or an exact journal.  I know likewise, that writers of\\ntravels, like dictionary-makers, are sunk into oblivion by the weight and\\nbulk of those who come last, and therefore lie uppermost.  And it is\\nhighly probable, that such travellers, who shall hereafter visit the\\ncountries described in this work of mine, may, by detecting my errors (if\\nthere be any), and adding many new discoveries of their own, justle me\\nout of vogue, and stand in my place, making the world forget that ever I\\nwas an author.  This indeed would be too great a mortification, if I\\nwrote for fame: but as my sole intention was the public good, I cannot be\\naltogether disappointed.  For who can read of the virtues I have\\nmentioned in the glorious _Houyhnhnms_, without being ashamed of his own\\nvices, when he considers himself as the reasoning, governing animal of\\nhis country?  I shall say nothing of those remote nations where _Yahoos_\\npreside; among which the least corrupted are the _Brobdingnagians_; whose\\nwise maxims in morality and government it would be our happiness to\\nobserve.  But I forbear descanting further, and rather leave the\\njudicious reader to his own remarks and application.\\n\\nI am not a little pleased that this work of mine can possibly meet with\\nno censurers: for what objections can be made against a writer, who\\nrelates only plain facts, that happened in such distant countries, where\\nwe have not the least interest, with respect either to trade or\\nnegotiations?  I have carefully avoided every fault with which common\\nwriters of travels are often too justly charged.  Besides, I meddle not\\nthe least with any party, but write without passion, prejudice, or\\nill-will against any man, or number of men, whatsoever.  I write for the\\nnoblest end, to inform and instruct mankind; over whom I may, without\\nbreach of modesty, pretend to some superiority, from the advantages I\\nreceived by conversing so long among the most accomplished _Houyhnhnms_.\\nI write without any view to profit or praise.  I never suffer a word to\\npass that may look like reflection, or possibly give the least offence,\\neven to those who are most ready to take it.  So that I hope I may with\\njustice pronounce myself an author perfectly blameless; against whom the\\ntribes of Answerers, Considerers, Observers, Reflectors, Detectors,\\nRemarkers, will never be able to find matter for exercising their\\ntalents.\\n\\nI confess, it was whispered to me, “that I was bound in duty, as a\\nsubject of England, to have given in a memorial to a secretary of state\\nat my first coming over; because, whatever lands are discovered by a\\nsubject belong to the crown.”  But I doubt whether our conquests in the\\ncountries I treat of would be as easy as those of Ferdinando Cortez over\\nthe naked Americans.  The _Lilliputians_, I think, are hardly worth the\\ncharge of a fleet and army to reduce them; and I question whether it\\nmight be prudent or safe to attempt the _Brobdingnagians_; or whether an\\nEnglish army would be much at their ease with the Flying Island over\\ntheir heads.  The _Houyhnhnms_ indeed appear not to be so well prepared\\nfor war, a science to which they are perfect strangers, and especially\\nagainst missive weapons.  However, supposing myself to be a minister of\\nstate, I could never give my advice for invading them.  Their prudence,\\nunanimity, unacquaintedness with fear, and their love of their country,\\nwould amply supply all defects in the military art.  Imagine twenty\\nthousand of them breaking into the midst of an European army, confounding\\nthe ranks, overturning the carriages, battering the warriors’ faces into\\nmummy by terrible yerks from their hinder hoofs; for they would well\\ndeserve the character given to Augustus, _Recalcitrat undique tutus_.\\nBut, instead of proposals for conquering that magnanimous nation, I\\nrather wish they were in a capacity, or disposition, to send a sufficient\\nnumber of their inhabitants for civilizing Europe, by teaching us the\\nfirst principles of honour, justice, truth, temperance, public spirit,\\nfortitude, chastity, friendship, benevolence, and fidelity.  The names of\\nall which virtues are still retained among us in most languages, and are\\nto be met with in modern, as well as ancient authors; which I am able to\\nassert from my own small reading.\\n\\nBut I had another reason, which made me less forward to enlarge his\\nmajesty’s dominions by my discoveries.  To say the truth, I had conceived\\na few scruples with relation to the distributive justice of princes upon\\nthose occasions.  For instance, a crew of pirates are driven by a storm\\nthey know not whither; at length a boy discovers land from the topmast;\\nthey go on shore to rob and plunder, they see a harmless people, are\\nentertained with kindness; they give the country a new name; they take\\nformal possession of it for their king; they set up a rotten plank, or a\\nstone, for a memorial; they murder two or three dozen of the natives,\\nbring away a couple more, by force, for a sample; return home, and get\\ntheir pardon.  Here commences a new dominion acquired with a title by\\ndivine right.  Ships are sent with the first opportunity; the natives\\ndriven out or destroyed; their princes tortured to discover their gold; a\\nfree license given to all acts of inhumanity and lust, the earth reeking\\nwith the blood of its inhabitants: and this execrable crew of butchers,\\nemployed in so pious an expedition, is a modern colony, sent to convert\\nand civilize an idolatrous and barbarous people!\\n\\nBut this description, I confess, does by no means affect the British\\nnation, who may be an example to the whole world for their wisdom, care,\\nand justice in planting colonies; their liberal endowments for the\\nadvancement of religion and learning; their choice of devout and able\\npastors to propagate Christianity; their caution in stocking their\\nprovinces with people of sober lives and conversations from this the\\nmother kingdom; their strict regard to the distribution of justice, in\\nsupplying the civil administration through all their colonies with\\nofficers of the greatest abilities, utter strangers to corruption; and,\\nto crown all, by sending the most vigilant and virtuous governors, who\\nhave no other views than the happiness of the people over whom they\\npreside, and the honour of the king their master.\\n\\nBut as those countries which I have described do not appear to have any\\ndesire of being conquered and enslaved, murdered or driven out by\\ncolonies, nor abound either in gold, silver, sugar, or tobacco, I did\\nhumbly conceive, they were by no means proper objects of our zeal, our\\nvalour, or our interest.  However, if those whom it more concerns think\\nfit to be of another opinion, I am ready to depose, when I shall be\\nlawfully called, that no European did ever visit those countries before\\nme.  I mean, if the inhabitants ought to be believed, unless a dispute\\nmay arise concerning the two _Yahoos_, said to have been seen many years\\nago upon a mountain in _Houyhnhnmland_.\\n\\nBut, as to the formality of taking possession in my sovereign’s name, it\\nnever came once into my thoughts; and if it had, yet, as my affairs then\\nstood, I should perhaps, in point of prudence and self-preservation, have\\nput it off to a better opportunity.\\n\\nHaving thus answered the only objection that can ever be raised against\\nme as a traveller, I here take a final leave of all my courteous readers,\\nand return to enjoy my own speculations in my little garden at Redriff;\\nto apply those excellent lessons of virtue which I learned among the\\n_Houyhnhnms_; to instruct the _Yahoos_ of my own family, is far as I\\nshall find them docible animals; to behold my figure often in a glass,\\nand thus, if possible, habituate myself by time to tolerate the sight of\\na human creature; to lament the brutality to _Houyhnhnms_ in my own\\ncountry, but always treat their persons with respect, for the sake of my\\nnoble master, his family, his friends, and the whole _Houyhnhnm_ race,\\nwhom these of ours have the honour to resemble in all their lineaments,\\nhowever their intellectuals came to degenerate.\\n\\nI began last week to permit my wife to sit at dinner with me, at the\\nfarthest end of a long table; and to answer (but with the utmost brevity)\\nthe few questions I asked her.  Yet, the smell of a _Yahoo_ continuing\\nvery offensive, I always keep my nose well stopped with rue, lavender, or\\ntobacco leaves.  And, although it be hard for a man late in life to\\nremove old habits, I am not altogether out of hopes, in some time, to\\nsuffer a neighbour _Yahoo_ in my company, without the apprehensions I am\\nyet under of his teeth or his claws.\\n\\nMy reconcilement to the _Yahoo_ kind in general might not be so\\ndifficult, if they would be content with those vices and follies only\\nwhich nature has entitled them to.  I am not in the least provoked at the\\nsight of a lawyer, a pickpocket, a colonel, a fool, a lord, a gamester, a\\npolitician, a whoremonger, a physician, an evidence, a suborner, an\\nattorney, a traitor, or the like; this is all according to the due course\\nof things: but when I behold a lump of deformity and diseases, both in\\nbody and mind, smitten with pride, it immediately breaks all the measures\\nof my patience; neither shall I be ever able to comprehend how such an\\nanimal, and such a vice, could tally together.  The wise and virtuous\\n_Houyhnhnms_, who abound in all excellences that can adorn a rational\\ncreature, have no name for this vice in their language, which has no\\nterms to express any thing that is evil, except those whereby they\\ndescribe the detestable qualities of their _Yahoos_, among which they\\nwere not able to distinguish this of pride, for want of thoroughly\\nunderstanding human nature, as it shows itself in other countries where\\nthat animal presides.  But I, who had more experience, could plainly\\nobserve some rudiments of it among the wild _Yahoos_.\\n\\nBut the _Houyhnhnms_, who live under the government of reason, are no\\nmore proud of the good qualities they possess, than I should be for not\\nwanting a leg or an arm; which no man in his wits would boast of,\\nalthough he must be miserable without them.  I dwell the longer upon this\\nsubject from the desire I have to make the society of an English _Yahoo_\\nby any means not insupportable; and therefore I here entreat those who\\nhave any tincture of this absurd vice, that they will not presume to come\\nin my sight.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n{301}  A stang is a pole or perch; sixteen feet and a half.\\n\\n{330}  An act of parliament has been since passed by which some breaches\\nof trust have been made capital.\\n\\n{454a}  Britannia.—_Sir W.

It exists\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\npeople in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\\n\\n\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\nFoundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Newby\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\n\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\nTo donate, please visit:\\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n'"

But you, or your\\n', 'interpolator, ought to have considered, that it was not my inclination,\\n', 'so was it not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my\\n', 'master _Houyhnhnm_: And besides, the fact was altogether false; for to my\\n', 'knowledge, being in England during some part of her majesty’s reign, she\\n', 'did govern by a chief minister; nay even by two successively, the first\\n', 'whereof was the lord of Godolphin, and the second the lord of Oxford; so\\n', 'that you have made me say the thing that was not.  Likewise in the\\n', 'account of the academy of projectors, and several passages of my\\n', 'discourse to my master _Houyhnhnm_, you have either omitted some material\\n', 'circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner, that I do\\n', 'hardly know my own work.

But, pray how could that which I\\n', 'spoke so many years ago, and at about five thousand leagues distance, in\\n', 'another reign, be applied to any of the _Yahoos_, who now are said to\\n', 'govern the herd; especially at a time when I little thought, or feared,\\n', 'the unhappiness of living under them?  Have not I the most reason to\\n', 'complain, when I see these very _Yahoos_ carried by _Houyhnhnms_ in a\\n', 'vehicle, as if they were brutes, and those the rational creatures?  And\\n', 'indeed to avoid so monstrous and detestable a sight was one principal\\n', 'motive of my retirement hither.\\n', '\\n', 'Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself, and to\\n', 'the trust I reposed in you.\\n', '\\n', 'I do, in the next place, complain of my own great want of judgment, in\\n', 'being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasoning of you and\\n', 'some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my travels to be\\n', 'published.  Pray bring to your mind how often I desired you to consider,\\n', 'when you insisted on the motive of public good, that the _Yahoos_ were a\\n', 'species of animals utterly incapable of amendment by precept or example:\\n', 'and so it has proved; for, instead of seeing a full stop put to all\\n', 'abuses and corruptions, at least in this little island, as I had reason\\n', 'to expect; behold, after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my\\n', 'book has produced one single effect according to my intentions.

When I left Mr. Bates, I went down to my\\n', 'father: where, by the assistance of him and my uncle John, and some other\\n', 'relations, I got forty pounds, and a promise of thirty pounds a year to\\n', 'maintain me at Leyden: there I studied physic two years and seven months,\\n', 'knowing it would be useful in long voyages.\\n', '\\n', 'Soon after my return from Leyden, I was recommended by my good master,\\n', 'Mr. Bates, to be surgeon to the Swallow, Captain Abraham Pannel,\\n', 'commander; with whom I continued three years and a half, making a voyage\\n', 'or two into the Levant, and some other parts.  When I came back I\\n', 'resolved to settle in London; to which Mr. Bates, my master, encouraged\\n', 'me, and by him I was recommended to several patients.  I took part of a\\n', 'small house in the Old Jewry; and being advised to alter my condition, I\\n', 'married Mrs. Mary Burton, second daughter to Mr. Edmund Burton, hosier,\\n', 'in Newgate-street, with whom I received four hundred pounds for a\\n', 'portion.\\n', '\\n', 'But my good master Bates dying in two years after, and I having few\\n', 'friends, my business began to fail; for my conscience would not suffer me\\n', 'to imitate the bad practice of too many among my brethren.  Having\\n', 'therefore consulted with my wife, and some of my acquaintance, I\\n', 'determined to go again to sea.  I was surgeon successively in two ships,\\n', 'and made several voyages, for six years, to the East and West Indies, by\\n', 'which I got some addition to my fortune.  My hours of leisure I spent in\\n', 'reading the best authors, ancient and modern, being always provided with\\n', 'a good number of books; and when I was ashore, in observing the manners\\n', 'and dispositions of the people, as well as learning their language;\\n', 'wherein I had a great facility, by the strength of my memory.\\n', '\\n', 'The last of these voyages not proving very fortunate, I grew weary of the\\n', 'sea, and intended to stay at home with my wife and family.  I removed\\n', 'from the Old Jewry to Fetter Lane, and from thence to Wapping, hoping to\\n', 'get business among the sailors; but it would not turn to account.  After\\n', 'three years expectation that things would mend, I accepted an\\n', 'advantageous offer from Captain William Prichard, master of the Antelope,\\n', 'who was making a voyage to the South Sea.  We set sail from Bristol, May\\n', '4, 1699, and our voyage was at first very prosperous.\\n', '\\n', 'It would not be proper, for some reasons, to trouble the reader with the\\n', 'particulars of our adventures in those seas; let it suffice to inform\\n', 'him, that in our passage from thence to the East Indies, we were driven\\n', 'by a violent storm to the north-west of Van Diemen’s Land.  By an\\n', 'observation, we found ourselves in the latitude of 30 degrees 2 minutes\\n', 'south.  Twelve of our crew were dead by immoderate labour and ill food;\\n', 'the rest were in a very weak condition.  On the 5th of November, which\\n', 'was the beginning of summer in those parts, the weather being very hazy,\\n', 'the seamen spied a rock within half a cable’s length of the ship; but the\\n', 'wind was so strong, that we were driven directly upon it, and immediately\\n', 'split.  Six of the crew, of whom I was one, having let down the boat into\\n', 'the sea, made a shift to get clear of the ship and the rock.  We rowed,\\n', 'by my computation, about three leagues, till we were able to work no\\n', 'longer, being already spent with labour while we were in the ship.  We\\n', 'therefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves, and in about half\\n', 'an hour the boat was overset by a sudden flurry from the north.  What\\n', 'became of my companions in the boat, as well as of those who escaped on\\n', 'the rock, or were left in the vessel, I cannot tell; but conclude they\\n', 'were all lost.  For my own part, I swam as fortune directed me, and was\\n', 'pushed forward by wind and tide.  I often let my legs drop, and could\\n', 'feel no bottom; but when I was almost gone, and able to struggle no\\n', 'longer, I found myself within my depth; and by this time the storm was\\n', 'much abated.  The declivity was so small, that I walked near a mile\\n', 'before I got to the shore, which I conjectured was about eight o’clock in\\n', 'the evening.  I then advanced forward near half a mile, but could not\\n', 'discover any sign of houses or inhabitants; at least I was in so weak a\\n', 'condition, that I did not observe them.  I was extremely tired, and with\\n', 'that, and the heat of the weather, and about half a pint of brandy that I\\n', 'drank as I left the ship, I found myself much inclined to sleep.  I lay\\n', 'down on the grass, which was very short and soft, where I slept sounder\\n', 'than ever I remembered to have done in my life, and, as I reckoned, about\\n', 'nine hours; for when I awaked, it was just day-light.  I attempted to\\n', 'rise, but was not able to stir: for, as I happened to lie on my back, I\\n', 'found my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to the ground;\\n', 'and my hair, which was long and thick, tied down in the same manner.  I\\n', 'likewise felt several slender ligatures across my body, from my arm-pits\\n', 'to my thighs.  I could only look upwards; the sun began to grow hot, and\\n', 'the light offended my eyes.  I heard a confused noise about me; but in\\n', 'the posture I lay, could see nothing except the sky.  In a little time I\\n', 'felt something alive moving on my left leg, which advancing gently\\n', 'forward over my breast, came almost up to my chin; when, bending my eyes\\n', 'downwards as much as I could, I perceived it to be a human creature not\\n', 'six inches high, with a bow and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his\\n', 'back.  In the mean time, I felt at least forty more of the same kind (as\\n', 'I conjectured) following the first.  I was in the utmost astonishment,\\n', 'and roared so loud, that they all ran back in a fright; and some of them,\\n', 'as I was afterwards told, were hurt with the falls they got by leaping\\n', 'from my sides upon the ground.  However, they soon returned, and one of\\n', 'them, who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face, lifting up\\n', 'his hands and eyes by way of admiration, cried out in a shrill but\\n', 'distinct voice, _Hekinah degul_: the others repeated the same words\\n', 'several times, but then I knew not what they meant.  I lay all this\\n', 'while, as the reader may believe, in great uneasiness.  At length,\\n', 'struggling to get loose, I had the fortune to break the strings, and\\n', 'wrench out the pegs that fastened my left arm to the ground; for, by\\n', 'lifting it up to my face, I discovered the methods they had taken to bind\\n', 'me, and at the same time with a violent pull, which gave me excessive\\n', 'pain, I a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair on the left\\n', 'side, so that I was just able to turn my head about two inches.  But the\\n', 'creatures ran off a second time, before I could seize them; whereupon\\n', 'there was a great shout in a very shrill accent, and after it ceased I\\n', 'heard one of them cry aloud _Tolgo phonac_; when in an instant I felt\\n', 'above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand, which, pricked me like\\n', 'so many needles; and besides, they shot another flight into the air, as\\n', 'we do bombs in Europe, whereof many, I suppose, fell on my body, (though\\n', 'I felt them not), and some on my face, which I immediately covered with\\n', 'my left hand.  When this shower of arrows was over, I fell a groaning\\n', 'with grief and pain; and then striving again to get loose, they\\n', 'discharged another volley larger than the first, and some of them\\n', 'attempted with spears to stick me in the sides; but by good luck I had on\\n', 'a buff jerkin, which they could not pierce.  I thought it the most\\n', 'prudent method to lie still, and my design was to continue so till night,\\n', 'when, my left hand being already loose, I could easily free myself: and\\n', 'as for the inhabitants, I had reason to believe I might be a match for\\n', 'the greatest army they could bring against me, if they were all of the\\n', 'same size with him that I saw.  But fortune disposed otherwise of me.\\n', 'When the people observed I was quiet, they discharged no more arrows;\\n', 'but, by the noise I heard, I knew their numbers increased; and about four\\n', 'yards from me, over against my right ear, I heard a knocking for above an\\n', 'hour, like that of people at work; when turning my head that way, as well\\n', 'as the pegs and strings would permit me, I saw a stage erected about a\\n', 'foot and a half from the ground, capable of holding four of the\\n', 'inhabitants, with two or three ladders to mount it: from whence one of\\n', 'them, who seemed to be a person of quality, made me a long speech,\\n', 'whereof I understood not one syllable.  But I should have mentioned, that\\n', 'before the principal person began his oration, he cried out three times,\\n', '_Langro dehul san_ (these words and the former were afterwards repeated\\n', 'and explained to me); whereupon, immediately, about fifty of the\\n', 'inhabitants came and cut the strings that fastened the left side of my\\n', 'head, which gave me the liberty of turning it to the right, and of\\n', 'observing the person and gesture of him that was to speak.  He appeared\\n', 'to be of a middle age, and taller than any of the other three who\\n', 'attended him, whereof one was a page that held up his train, and seemed\\n', 'to be somewhat longer than my middle finger; the other two stood one on\\n', 'each side to support him.  He acted every part of an orator, and I could\\n', 'observe many periods of threatenings, and others of promises, pity, and\\n', 'kindness.  I answered in a few words, but in the most submissive manner,\\n', 'lifting up my left hand, and both my eyes to the sun, as calling him for\\n', 'a witness; and being almost famished with hunger, having not eaten a\\n', 'morsel for some hours before I left the ship, I found the demands of\\n', 'nature so strong upon me, that I could not forbear showing my impatience\\n', '(perhaps against the strict rules of decency) by putting my finger\\n', 'frequently to my mouth, to signify that I wanted food.  The _hurgo_ (for\\n', 'so they call a great lord, as I afterwards learnt) understood me very\\n', 'well.  He descended from the stage, and commanded that several ladders\\n', 'should be applied to my sides, on which above a hundred of the\\n', 'inhabitants mounted and walked towards my mouth, laden with baskets full\\n', 'of meat, which had been provided and sent thither by the king’s orders,\\n', 'upon the first intelligence he received of me.  I observed there was the\\n', 'flesh of several animals, but could not distinguish them by the taste.\\n', 'There were shoulders, legs, and loins, shaped like those of mutton, and\\n', 'very well dressed, but smaller than the wings of a lark.  I ate them by\\n', 'two or three at a mouthful, and took three loaves at a time, about the\\n', 'bigness of musket bullets.  They supplied me as fast as they could,\\n', 'showing a thousand marks of wonder and astonishment at my bulk and\\n', 'appetite.  I then made another sign, that I wanted drink.  They found by\\n', 'my eating that a small quantity would not suffice me; and being a most\\n', 'ingenious people, they slung up, with great dexterity, one of their\\n', 'largest hogsheads, then rolled it towards my hand, and beat out the top;\\n', 'I drank it off at a draught, which I might well do, for it did not hold\\n', 'half a pint, and tasted like a small wine of Burgundy, but much more\\n', 'delicious.  They brought me a second hogshead, which I drank in the same\\n', 'manner, and made signs for more; but they had none to give me.  When I\\n', 'had performed these wonders, they shouted for joy, and danced upon my\\n', 'breast, repeating several times as they did at first, _Hekinah degul_.\\n', 'They made me a sign that I should throw down the two hogsheads, but first\\n', 'warning the people below to stand out of the way, crying aloud, _Borach\\n', 'mevolah_; and when they saw the vessels in the air, there was a universal\\n', 'shout of _Hekinah degul_.  I confess I was often tempted, while they were\\n', 'passing backwards and forwards on my body, to seize forty or fifty of the\\n', 'first that came in my reach, and dash them against the ground.  But the\\n', 'remembrance of what I had felt, which probably might not be the worst\\n', 'they could do, and the promise of honour I made them—for so I interpreted\\n', 'my submissive behaviour—soon drove out these imaginations.  Besides, I\\n', 'now considered myself as bound by the laws of hospitality, to a people\\n', 'who had treated me with so much expense and magnificence.  However, in my\\n', 'thoughts I could not sufficiently wonder at the intrepidity of these\\n', 'diminutive mortals, who durst venture to mount and walk upon my body,\\n', 'while one of my hands was at liberty, without trembling at the very sight\\n', 'of so prodigious a creature as I must appear to them.  After some time,\\n', 'when they observed that I made no more demands for meat, there appeared\\n', 'before me a person of high rank from his imperial majesty.  His\\n', 'excellency, having mounted on the small of my right leg, advanced\\n', 'forwards up to my face, with about a dozen of his retinue; and producing\\n', 'his credentials under the signet royal, which he applied close to my\\n', 'eyes, spoke about ten minutes without any signs of anger, but with a kind\\n', 'of determinate resolution, often pointing forwards, which, as I\\n', 'afterwards found, was towards the capital city, about half a mile\\n', 'distant; whither it was agreed by his majesty in council that I must be\\n', 'conveyed.  I answered in few words, but to no purpose, and made a sign\\n', 'with my hand that was loose, putting it to the other (but over his\\n', 'excellency’s head for fear of hurting him or his train) and then to my\\n', 'own head and body, to signify that I desired my liberty.  It appeared\\n', 'that he understood me well enough, for he shook his head by way of\\n', 'disapprobation, and held his hand in a posture to show that I must be\\n', 'carried as a prisoner.  However, he made other signs to let me understand\\n', 'that I should have meat and drink enough, and very good treatment.\\n', 'Whereupon I once more thought of attempting to break my bonds; but again,\\n', 'when I felt the smart of their arrows upon my face and hands, which were\\n', 'all in blisters, and many of the darts still sticking in them, and\\n', 'observing likewise that the number of my enemies increased, I gave tokens\\n', 'to let them know that they might do with me what they pleased.  Upon\\n', 'this, the _hurgo_ and his train withdrew, with much civility and cheerful\\n', 'countenances.  Soon after I heard a general shout, with frequent\\n', 'repetitions of the words _Peplom selan_; and I felt great numbers of\\n', 'people on my left side relaxing the cords to such a degree, that I was\\n', 'able to turn upon my right, and to ease myself with making water; which I\\n', 'very plentifully did, to the great astonishment of the people; who,\\n', 'conjecturing by my motion what I was going to do, immediately opened to\\n', 'the right and left on that side, to avoid the torrent, which fell with\\n', 'such noise and violence from me.  But before this, they had daubed my\\n', 'face and both my hands with a sort of ointment, very pleasant to the\\n', 'smell, which, in a few minutes, removed all the smart of their arrows.\\n', 'These circumstances, added to the refreshment I had received by their\\n', 'victuals and drink, which were very nourishing, disposed me to sleep.  I\\n', 'slept about eight hours, as I was afterwards assured; and it was no\\n', 'wonder, for the physicians, by the emperor’s order, had mingled a sleepy\\n', 'potion in the hogsheads of wine.\\n', '\\n', 'It seems, that upon the first moment I was discovered sleeping on the\\n', 'ground, after my landing, the emperor had early notice of it by an\\n', 'express; and determined in council, that I should be tied in the manner I\\n', 'have related, (which was done in the night while I slept;) that plenty of\\n', 'meat and drink should be sent to me, and a machine prepared to carry me\\n', 'to the capital city.\\n', '\\n', 'This resolution perhaps may appear very bold and dangerous, and I am\\n', 'confident would not be imitated by any prince in Europe on the like\\n', 'occasion.  However, in my opinion, it was extremely prudent, as well as\\n', 'generous: for, supposing these people had endeavoured to kill me with\\n', 'their spears and arrows, while I was asleep, I should certainly have\\n', 'awaked with the first sense of smart, which might so far have roused my\\n', 'rage and strength, as to have enabled me to break the strings wherewith I\\n', 'was tied; after which, as they were not able to make resistance, so they\\n', 'could expect no mercy.\\n', '\\n', 'These people are most excellent mathematicians, and arrived to a great\\n', 'perfection in mechanics, by the countenance and encouragement of the\\n', 'emperor, who is a renowned patron of learning.  This prince has several\\n', 'machines fixed on wheels, for the carriage of trees and other great\\n', 'weights.  He often builds his largest men of war, whereof some are nine\\n', 'feet long, in the woods where the timber grows, and has them carried on\\n', 'these engines three or four hundred yards to the sea.  Five hundred\\n', 'carpenters and engineers were immediately set at work to prepare the\\n', 'greatest engine they had.  It was a frame of wood raised three inches\\n', 'from the ground, about seven feet long, and four wide, moving upon\\n', 'twenty-two wheels.  The shout I heard was upon the arrival of this\\n', 'engine, which, it seems, set out in four hours after my landing.  It was\\n', 'brought parallel to me, as I lay.  But the principal difficulty was to\\n', 'raise and place me in this vehicle.  Eighty poles, each of one foot high,\\n', 'were erected for this purpose, and very strong cords, of the bigness of\\n', 'packthread, were fastened by hooks to many bandages, which the workmen\\n', 'had girt round my neck, my hands, my body, and my legs.  Nine hundred of\\n', 'the strongest men were employed to draw up these cords, by many pulleys\\n', 'fastened on the poles; and thus, in less than three hours, I was raised\\n', 'and slung into the engine, and there tied fast.  All this I was told;\\n', 'for, while the operation was performing, I lay in a profound sleep, by\\n', 'the force of that soporiferous medicine infused into my liquor.  Fifteen\\n', 'hundred of the emperor’s largest horses, each about four inches and a\\n', 'half high, were employed to draw me towards the metropolis, which, as I\\n', 'said, was half a mile distant.\\n', '\\n', 'About four hours after we began our journey, I awaked by a very\\n', 'ridiculous accident; for the carriage being stopped a while, to adjust\\n', 'something that was out of order, two or three of the young natives had\\n', 'the curiosity to see how I looked when I was asleep; they climbed up into\\n', 'the engine, and advancing very softly to my face, one of them, an officer\\n', 'in the guards, put the sharp end of his half-pike a good way up into my\\n', 'left nostril, which tickled my nose like a straw, and made me sneeze\\n', 'violently; whereupon they stole off unperceived, and it was three weeks\\n', 'before I knew the cause of my waking so suddenly.  We made a long march\\n', 'the remaining part of the day, and, rested at night with five hundred\\n', 'guards on each side of me, half with torches, and half with bows and\\n', 'arrows, ready to shoot me if I should offer to stir.  The next morning at\\n', 'sun-rise we continued our march, and arrived within two hundred yards of\\n', 'the city gates about noon.  The emperor, and all his court, came out to\\n', 'meet us; but his great officers would by no means suffer his majesty to\\n', 'endanger his person by mounting on my body.\\n', '\\n', 'At the place where the carriage stopped there stood an ancient temple,\\n', 'esteemed to be the largest in the whole kingdom; which, having been\\n', 'polluted some years before by an unnatural murder, was, according to the\\n', 'zeal of those people, looked upon as profane, and therefore had been\\n', 'applied to common use, and all the ornaments and furniture carried away.\\n', 'In this edifice it was determined I should lodge.  The great gate\\n', 'fronting to the north was about four feet high, and almost two feet wide,\\n', 'through which I could easily creep.  On each side of the gate was a small\\n', 'window, not above six inches from the ground: into that on the left side,\\n', 'the king’s smith conveyed fourscore and eleven chains, like those that\\n', 'hang to a lady’s watch in Europe, and almost as large, which were locked\\n', 'to my left leg with six-and-thirty padlocks.  Over against this temple,\\n', 'on the other side of the great highway, at twenty feet distance, there\\n', 'was a turret at least five feet high.  Here the emperor ascended, with\\n', 'many principal lords of his court, to have an opportunity of viewing me,\\n', 'as I was told, for I could not see them.  It was reckoned that above a\\n', 'hundred thousand inhabitants came out of the town upon the same errand;\\n', 'and, in spite of my guards, I believe there could not be fewer than ten\\n', 'thousand at several times, who mounted my body by the help of ladders.\\n', 'But a proclamation was soon issued, to forbid it upon pain of death.\\n', 'When the workmen found it was impossible for me to break loose, they cut\\n', 'all the strings that bound me; whereupon I rose up, with as melancholy a\\n', 'disposition as ever I had in my life.  But the noise and astonishment of\\n', 'the people, at seeing me rise and walk, are not to be expressed.  The\\n', 'chains that held my left leg were about two yards long, and gave me not\\n', 'only the liberty of walking backwards and forwards in a semicircle, but,\\n', 'being fixed within four inches of the gate, allowed me to creep in, and\\n', 'lie at my full length in the temple.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER II.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The emperor of Lilliput, attended by several of the nobility, comes to\\n', 'see the author in his confinement.

But this was the only time I was ever guilty of so\\n', 'uncleanly an action; for which I cannot but hope the candid reader will\\n', 'give some allowance, after he has maturely and impartially considered my\\n', 'case, and the distress I was in.  From this time my constant practice\\n', 'was, as soon as I rose, to perform that business in open air, at the full\\n', 'extent of my chain; and due care was taken every morning before company\\n', 'came, that the offensive matter should be carried off in wheel-barrows,\\n', 'by two servants appointed for that purpose.  I would not have dwelt so\\n', 'long upon a circumstance that, perhaps, at first sight, may appear not\\n', 'very momentous, if I had not thought it necessary to justify my\\n', 'character, in point of cleanliness, to the world; which, I am told, some\\n', 'of my maligners have been pleased, upon this and other occasions, to call\\n', 'in question.\\n', '\\n', 'When this adventure was at an end, I came back out of my house, having\\n', 'occasion for fresh air.  The emperor was already descended from the\\n', 'tower, and advancing on horseback towards me, which had like to have cost\\n', 'him dear; for the beast, though very well trained, yet wholly unused to\\n', 'such a sight, which appeared as if a mountain moved before him, reared up\\n', 'on its hinder feet: but that prince, who is an excellent horseman, kept\\n', 'his seat, till his attendants ran in, and held the bridle, while his\\n', 'majesty had time to dismount.  When he alighted, he surveyed me round\\n', 'with great admiration; but kept beyond the length of my chain.  He\\n', 'ordered his cooks and butlers, who were already prepared, to give me\\n', 'victuals and drink, which they pushed forward in a sort of vehicles upon\\n', 'wheels, till I could reach them.  I took these vehicles and soon emptied\\n', 'them all; twenty of them were filled with meat, and ten with liquor; each\\n', 'of the former afforded me two or three good mouthfuls; and I emptied the\\n', 'liquor of ten vessels, which was contained in earthen vials, into one\\n', 'vehicle, drinking it off at a draught; and so I did with the rest.  The\\n', 'empress, and young princes of the blood of both sexes, attended by many\\n', 'ladies, sat at some distance in their chairs; but upon the accident that\\n', 'happened to the emperor’s horse, they alighted, and came near his person,\\n', 'which I am now going to describe.  He is taller by almost the breadth of\\n', 'my nail, than any of his court; which alone is enough to strike an awe\\n', 'into the beholders.  His features are strong and masculine, with an\\n', 'Austrian lip and arched nose, his complexion olive, his countenance\\n', 'erect, his body and limbs well proportioned, all his motions graceful,\\n', 'and his deportment majestic.  He was then past his prime, being\\n', 'twenty-eight years and three quarters old, of which he had reigned about\\n', 'seven in great felicity, and generally victorious.  For the better\\n', 'convenience of beholding him, I lay on my side, so that my face was\\n', 'parallel to his, and he stood but three yards off: however, I have had\\n', 'him since many times in my hand, and therefore cannot be deceived in the\\n', 'description.  His dress was very plain and simple, and the fashion of it\\n', 'between the Asiatic and the European; but he had on his head a light\\n', 'helmet of gold, adorned with jewels, and a plume on the crest.  He held\\n', 'his sword drawn in his hand to defend himself, if I should happen to\\n', 'break loose; it was almost three inches long; the hilt and scabbard were\\n', 'gold enriched with diamonds.  His voice was shrill, but very clear and\\n', 'articulate; and I could distinctly hear it when I stood up.  The ladies\\n', 'and courtiers were all most magnificently clad; so that the spot they\\n', 'stood upon seemed to resemble a petticoat spread upon the ground,\\n', 'embroidered with figures of gold and silver.  His imperial majesty spoke\\n', 'often to me, and I returned answers: but neither of us could understand a\\n', 'syllable.  There were several of his priests and lawyers present (as I\\n', 'conjectured by their habits), who were commanded to address themselves to\\n', 'me; and I spoke to them in as many languages as I had the least\\n', 'smattering of, which were High and Low Dutch, Latin, French, Spanish,\\n', 'Italian, and Lingua Franca, but all to no purpose.  After about two hours\\n', 'the court retired, and I was left with a strong guard, to prevent the\\n', 'impertinence, and probably the malice of the rabble, who were very\\n', 'impatient to crowd about me as near as they durst; and some of them had\\n', 'the impudence to shoot their arrows at me, as I sat on the ground by the\\n', 'door of my house, whereof one very narrowly missed my left eye.  But the\\n', 'colonel ordered six of the ringleaders to be seized, and thought no\\n', 'punishment so proper as to deliver them bound into my hands; which some\\n', 'of his soldiers accordingly did, pushing them forward with the butt-ends\\n', 'of their pikes into my reach.  I took them all in my right hand, put five\\n', 'of them into my coat-pocket; and as to the sixth, I made a countenance as\\n', 'if I would eat him alive.  The poor man squalled terribly, and the\\n', 'colonel and his officers were in much pain, especially when they saw me\\n', 'take out my penknife: but I soon put them out of fear; for, looking\\n', 'mildly, and immediately cutting the strings he was bound with, I set him\\n', 'gently on the ground, and away he ran.  I treated the rest in the same\\n', 'manner, taking them one by one out of my pocket; and I observed both the\\n', 'soldiers and people were highly delighted at this mark of my clemency,\\n', 'which was represented very much to my advantage at court.\\n', '\\n', 'Towards night I got with some difficulty into my house, where I lay on\\n', 'the ground, and continued to do so about a fortnight; during which time,\\n', 'the emperor gave orders to have a bed prepared for me.  Six hundred beds\\n', 'of the common measure were brought in carriages, and worked up in my\\n', 'house; a hundred and fifty of their beds, sewn together, made up the\\n', 'breadth and length; and these were four double: which, however, kept me\\n', 'but very indifferently from the hardness of the floor, that was of smooth\\n', 'stone.  By the same computation, they provided me with sheets, blankets,\\n', 'and coverlets, tolerable enough for one who had been so long inured to\\n', 'hardships.\\n', '\\n', 'As the news of my arrival spread through the kingdom, it brought\\n', 'prodigious numbers of rich, idle, and curious people to see me; so that\\n', 'the villages were almost emptied; and great neglect of tillage and\\n', 'household affairs must have ensued, if his imperial majesty had not\\n', 'provided, by several proclamations and orders of state, against this\\n', 'inconveniency.  He directed that those who had already beheld me should\\n', 'return home, and not presume to come within fifty yards of my house,\\n', 'without license from the court; whereby the secretaries of state got\\n', 'considerable fees.\\n', '\\n', 'In the mean time the emperor held frequent councils, to debate what\\n', 'course should be taken with me; and I was afterwards assured by a\\n', 'particular friend, a person of great quality, who was as much in the\\n', 'secret as any, that the court was under many difficulties concerning me.\\n', 'They apprehended my breaking loose; that my diet would be very expensive,\\n', 'and might cause a famine.  Sometimes they determined to starve me; or at\\n', 'least to shoot me in the face and hands with poisoned arrows, which would\\n', 'soon despatch me; but again they considered, that the stench of so large\\n', 'a carcass might produce a plague in the metropolis, and probably spread\\n', 'through the whole kingdom.  In the midst of these consultations, several\\n', 'officers of the army went to the door of the great council-chamber, and\\n', 'two of them being admitted, gave an account of my behaviour to the six\\n', 'criminals above-mentioned; which made so favourable an impression in the\\n', 'breast of his majesty and the whole board, in my behalf, that an imperial\\n', 'commission was issued out, obliging all the villages, nine hundred yards\\n', 'round the city, to deliver in every morning six beeves, forty sheep, and\\n', 'other victuals for my sustenance; together with a proportionable quantity\\n', 'of bread, and wine, and other liquors; for the due payment of which, his\\n', 'majesty gave assignments upon his treasury:—for this prince lives chiefly\\n', 'upon his own demesnes; seldom, except upon great occasions, raising any\\n', 'subsidies upon his subjects, who are bound to attend him in his wars at\\n', 'their own expense.  An establishment was also made of six hundred persons\\n', 'to be my domestics, who had board-wages allowed for their maintenance,\\n', 'and tents built for them very conveniently on each side of my door.  It\\n', 'was likewise ordered, that three hundred tailors should make me a suit of\\n', 'clothes, after the fashion of the country; that six of his majesty’s\\n', 'greatest scholars should be employed to instruct me in their language;\\n', 'and lastly, that the emperor’s horses, and those of the nobility and\\n', 'troops of guards, should be frequently exercised in my sight, to accustom\\n', 'themselves to me.  All these orders were duly put in execution; and in\\n', 'about three weeks I made a great progress in learning their language;\\n', 'during which time the emperor frequently honoured me with his visits, and\\n', 'was pleased to assist my masters in teaching me.  We began already to\\n', 'converse together in some sort; and the first words I learnt, were to\\n', 'express my desire “that he would please give me my liberty;” which I\\n', 'every day repeated on my knees.  His answer, as I could comprehend it,\\n', 'was, “that this must be a work of time, not to be thought on without the\\n', 'advice of his council, and that first I must _lumos kelmin pesso desmar\\n', 'lon emposo_;” that is, swear a peace with him and his kingdom.  However,\\n', 'that I should be used with all kindness.  And he advised me to “acquire,\\n', 'by my patience and discreet behaviour, the good opinion of himself and\\n', 'his subjects.”  He desired “I would not take it ill, if he gave orders to\\n', 'certain proper officers to search me; for probably I might carry about me\\n', 'several weapons, which must needs be dangerous things, if they answered\\n', 'the bulk of so prodigious a person.”  I said, “His majesty should be\\n', 'satisfied; for I was ready to strip myself, and turn up my pockets before\\n', 'him.”  This I delivered part in words, and part in signs.  He replied,\\n', '“that, by the laws of the kingdom, I must be searched by two of his\\n', 'officers; that he knew this could not be done without my consent and\\n', 'assistance; and he had so good an opinion of my generosity and justice,\\n', 'as to trust their persons in my hands; that whatever they took from me,\\n', 'should be returned when I left the country, or paid for at the rate which\\n', 'I would set upon them.”  I took up the two officers in my hands, put them\\n', 'first into my coat-pockets, and then into every other pocket about me,\\n', 'except my two fobs, and another secret pocket, which I had no mind should\\n', 'be searched, wherein I had some little necessaries that were of no\\n', 'consequence to any but myself.  In one of my fobs there was a silver\\n', 'watch, and in the other a small quantity of gold in a purse.  These\\n', 'gentlemen, having pen, ink, and paper, about them, made an exact\\n', 'inventory of every thing they saw; and when they had done, desired I\\n', 'would set them down, that they might deliver it to the emperor.  This\\n', 'inventory I afterwards translated into English, and is, word for word, as\\n', 'follows:\\n', '\\n', '    “_Imprimis_: In the right coat-pocket of the great man-mountain” (for\\n', '    so I interpret the words _quinbus flestrin_,) “after the strictest\\n', '    search, we found only one great piece of coarse-cloth, large enough\\n', '    to be a foot-cloth for your majesty’s chief room of state.  In the\\n', '    left pocket we saw a huge silver chest, with a cover of the same\\n', '    metal, which we, the searchers, were not able to lift.  We desired it\\n', '    should be opened, and one of us stepping into it, found himself up to\\n', '    the mid leg in a sort of dust, some part whereof flying up to our\\n', '    faces set us both a sneezing for several times together.  In his\\n', '    right waistcoat-pocket we found a prodigious bundle of white thin\\n', '    substances, folded one over another, about the bigness of three men,\\n', '    tied with a strong cable, and marked with black figures; which we\\n', '    humbly conceive to be writings, every letter almost half as large as\\n', '    the palm of our hands.  In the left there was a sort of engine, from\\n', '    the back of which were extended twenty long poles, resembling the\\n', '    pallisados before your majesty’s court: wherewith we conjecture the\\n', '    man-mountain combs his head; for we did not always trouble him with\\n', '    questions, because we found it a great difficulty to make him\\n', '    understand us.  In the large pocket, on the right side of his middle\\n', '    cover” (so I translate the word _ranfulo_, by which they meant my\\n', '    breeches,) “we saw a hollow pillar of iron, about the length of a\\n', '    man, fastened to a strong piece of timber larger than the pillar; and\\n', '    upon one side of the pillar, were huge pieces of iron sticking out,\\n', '    cut into strange figures, which we know not what to make of.  In the\\n', '    left pocket, another engine of the same kind.  In the smaller pocket\\n', '    on the right side, were several round flat pieces of white and red\\n', '    metal, of different bulk; some of the white, which seemed to be\\n', '    silver, were so large and heavy, that my comrade and I could hardly\\n', '    lift them.  In the left pocket were two black pillars irregularly\\n', '    shaped: we could not, without difficulty, reach the top of them, as\\n', '    we stood at the bottom of his pocket.  One of them was covered, and\\n', '    seemed all of a piece: but at the upper end of the other there\\n', '    appeared a white round substance, about twice the bigness of our\\n', '    heads.  Within each of these was enclosed a prodigious plate of\\n', '    steel; which, by our orders, we obliged him to show us, because we\\n', '    apprehended they might be dangerous engines.  He took them out of\\n', '    their cases, and told us, that in his own country his practice was to\\n', '    shave his beard with one of these, and cut his meat with the other.\\n', '    There were two pockets which we could not enter: these he called his\\n', '    fobs; they were two large slits cut into the top of his middle cover,\\n', '    but squeezed close by the pressure of his belly.  Out of the right\\n', '    fob hung a great silver chain, with a wonderful kind of engine at the\\n', '    bottom.  We directed him to draw out whatever was at the end of that\\n', '    chain; which appeared to be a globe, half silver, and half of some\\n', '    transparent metal; for, on the transparent side, we saw certain\\n', '    strange figures circularly drawn, and thought we could touch them,\\n', '    till we found our fingers stopped by the lucid substance.  He put\\n', '    this engine into our ears, which made an incessant noise, like that\\n', '    of a water-mill: and we conjecture it is either some unknown animal,\\n', '    or the god that he worships; but we are more inclined to the latter\\n', '    opinion, because he assured us, (if we understood him right, for he\\n', '    expressed himself very imperfectly) that he seldom did any thing\\n', '    without consulting it.  He called it his oracle, and said, it pointed\\n', '    out the time for every action of his life.  From the left fob he took\\n', '    out a net almost large enough for a fisherman, but contrived to open\\n', '    and shut like a purse, and served him for the same use: we found\\n', '    therein several massy pieces of yellow metal, which, if they be real\\n', '    gold, must be of immense value.\\n', '\\n', '    “Having thus, in obedience to your majesty’s commands, diligently\\n', '    searched all his pockets, we observed a girdle about his waist made\\n', '    of the hide of some prodigious animal, from which, on the left side,\\n', '    hung a sword of the length of five men; and on the right, a bag or\\n', '    pouch divided into two cells, each cell capable of holding three of\\n', '    your majesty’s subjects.  In one of these cells were several globes,\\n', '    or balls, of a most ponderous metal, about the bigness of our heads,\\n', '    and requiring a strong hand to lift them: the other cell contained a\\n', '    heap of certain black grains, but of no great bulk or weight, for we\\n', '    could hold above fifty of them in the palms of our hands.\\n', '\\n', '    “This is an exact inventory of what we found about the body of the\\n', '    man-mountain, who used us with great civility, and due respect to\\n', '    your majesty’s commission.  Signed and sealed on the fourth day of\\n', '    the eighty-ninth moon of your majesty’s auspicious reign.\\n', '\\n', '                                          CLEFRIN FRELOCK, MARSI FRELOCK.”\\n', '\\n', 'When this inventory was read over to the emperor, he directed me,\\n', 'although in very gentle terms, to deliver up the several particulars.  He\\n', 'first called for my scimitar, which I took out, scabbard and all.  In the\\n', 'mean time he ordered three thousand of his choicest troops (who then\\n', 'attended him) to surround me at a distance, with their bows and arrows\\n', 'just ready to discharge; but I did not observe it, for mine eyes were\\n', 'wholly fixed upon his majesty.  He then desired me to draw my scimitar,\\n', 'which, although it had got some rust by the sea water, was, in most\\n', 'parts, exceeding bright.  I did so, and immediately all the troops gave a\\n', 'shout between terror and surprise; for the sun shone clear, and the\\n', 'reflection dazzled their eyes, as I waved the scimitar to and fro in my\\n', 'hand.  His majesty, who is a most magnanimous prince, was less daunted\\n', 'than I could expect: he ordered me to return it into the scabbard, and\\n', 'cast it on the ground as gently as I could, about six feet from the end\\n', 'of my chain.  The next thing he demanded was one of the hollow iron\\n', 'pillars; by which he meant my pocket pistols.  I drew it out, and at his\\n', 'desire, as well as I could, expressed to him the use of it; and charging\\n', 'it only with powder, which, by the closeness of my pouch, happened to\\n', 'escape wetting in the sea (an inconvenience against which all prudent\\n', 'mariners take special care to provide,) I first cautioned the emperor not\\n', 'to be afraid, and then I let it off in the air.  The astonishment here\\n', 'was much greater than at the sight of my scimitar.  Hundreds fell down as\\n', 'if they had been struck dead; and even the emperor, although he stood his\\n', 'ground, could not recover himself for some time.  I delivered up both my\\n', 'pistols in the same manner as I had done my scimitar, and then my pouch\\n', 'of powder and bullets; begging him that the former might be kept from\\n', 'fire, for it would kindle with the smallest spark, and blow up his\\n', 'imperial palace into the air.  I likewise delivered up my watch, which\\n', 'the emperor was very curious to see, and commanded two of his tallest\\n', 'yeomen of the guards to bear it on a pole upon their shoulders, as\\n', 'draymen in England do a barrel of ale.  He was amazed at the continual\\n', 'noise it made, and the motion of the minute-hand, which he could easily\\n', 'discern; for their sight is much more acute than ours: he asked the\\n', 'opinions of his learned men about it, which were various and remote, as\\n', 'the reader may well imagine without my repeating; although indeed I could\\n', 'not very perfectly understand them.  I then gave up my silver and copper\\n', 'money, my purse, with nine large pieces of gold, and some smaller ones;\\n', 'my knife and razor, my comb and silver snuff-box, my handkerchief and\\n', 'journal-book.  My scimitar, pistols, and pouch, were conveyed in\\n', 'carriages to his majesty’s stores; but the rest of my goods were returned\\n', 'me.\\n', '\\n', 'I had as I before observed, one private pocket, which escaped their\\n', 'search, wherein there was a pair of spectacles (which I sometimes use for\\n', 'the weakness of mine eyes,) a pocket perspective, and some other little\\n', 'conveniences; which, being of no consequence to the emperor, I did not\\n', 'think myself bound in honour to discover, and I apprehended they might be\\n', 'lost or spoiled if I ventured them out of my possession.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER III.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The author diverts the emperor, and his nobility of both sexes, in a very\\n', 'uncommon manner.  The diversions of the court of Lilliput described.  The\\n', 'author has his liberty granted him upon certain conditions.\\n', '\\n', 'My gentleness and good behaviour had gained so far on the emperor and his\\n', 'court, and indeed upon the army and people in general, that I began to\\n', 'conceive hopes of getting my liberty in a short time.  I took all\\n', 'possible methods to cultivate this favourable disposition.  The natives\\n', 'came, by degrees, to be less apprehensive of any danger from me.  I would\\n', 'sometimes lie down, and let five or six of them dance on my hand; and at\\n', 'last the boys and girls would venture to come and play at hide-and-seek\\n', 'in my hair.  I had now made a good progress in understanding and speaking\\n', 'the language.  The emperor had a mind one day to entertain me with\\n', 'several of the country shows, wherein they exceed all nations I have\\n', 'known, both for dexterity and magnificence.  I was diverted with none so\\n', 'much as that of the rope-dancers, performed upon a slender white thread,\\n', 'extended about two feet, and twelve inches from the ground.  Upon which I\\n', 'shall desire liberty, with the reader’s patience, to enlarge a little.\\n', '\\n', 'This diversion is only practised by those persons who are candidates for\\n', 'great employments, and high favour at court.  They are trained in this\\n', 'art from their youth, and are not always of noble birth, or liberal\\n', 'education.  When a great office is vacant, either by death or disgrace\\n', '(which often happens,) five or six of those candidates petition the\\n', 'emperor to entertain his majesty and the court with a dance on the rope;\\n', 'and whoever jumps the highest, without falling, succeeds in the office.\\n', 'Very often the chief ministers themselves are commanded to show their\\n', 'skill, and to convince the emperor that they have not lost their faculty.\\n', 'Flimnap, the treasurer, is allowed to cut a caper on the straight rope,\\n', 'at least an inch higher than any other lord in the whole empire.  I have\\n', 'seen him do the summerset several times together, upon a trencher fixed\\n', 'on a rope which is no thicker than a common packthread in England.  My\\n', 'friend Reldresal, principal secretary for private affairs, is, in my\\n', 'opinion, if I am not partial, the second after the treasurer; the rest of\\n', 'the great officers are much upon a par.\\n', '\\n', 'These diversions are often attended with fatal accidents, whereof great\\n', 'numbers are on record.  I myself have seen two or three candidates break\\n', 'a limb.  But the danger is much greater, when the ministers themselves\\n', 'are commanded to show their dexterity; for, by contending to excel\\n', 'themselves and their fellows, they strain so far that there is hardly one\\n', 'of them who has not received a fall, and some of them two or three.  I\\n', 'was assured that, a year or two before my arrival, Flimnap would\\n', 'infallibly have broke his neck, if one of the king’s cushions, that\\n', 'accidentally lay on the ground, had not weakened the force of his fall.\\n', '\\n', 'There is likewise another diversion, which is only shown before the\\n', 'emperor and empress, and first minister, upon particular occasions.  The\\n', 'emperor lays on the table three fine silken threads of six inches long;\\n', 'one is blue, the other red, and the third green.  These threads are\\n', 'proposed as prizes for those persons whom the emperor has a mind to\\n', 'distinguish by a peculiar mark of his favour.  The ceremony is performed\\n', 'in his majesty’s great chamber of state, where the candidates are to\\n', 'undergo a trial of dexterity very different from the former, and such as\\n', 'I have not observed the least resemblance of in any other country of the\\n', 'new or old world.  The emperor holds a stick in his hands, both ends\\n', 'parallel to the horizon, while the candidates advancing, one by one,\\n', 'sometimes leap over the stick, sometimes creep under it, backward and\\n', 'forward, several times, according as the stick is advanced or depressed.\\n', 'Sometimes the emperor holds one end of the stick, and his first minister\\n', 'the other; sometimes the minister has it entirely to himself.  Whoever\\n', 'performs his part with most agility, and holds out the longest in leaping\\n', 'and creeping, is rewarded with the blue-coloured silk; the red is given\\n', 'to the next, and the green to the third, which they all wear girt twice\\n', 'round about the middle; and you see few great persons about this court\\n', 'who are not adorned with one of these girdles.\\n', '\\n', 'The horses of the army, and those of the royal stables, having been daily\\n', 'led before me, were no longer shy, but would come up to my very feet\\n', 'without starting.  The riders would leap them over my hand, as I held it\\n', 'on the ground; and one of the emperor’s huntsmen, upon a large courser,\\n', 'took my foot, shoe and all; which was indeed a prodigious leap.  I had\\n', 'the good fortune to divert the emperor one day after a very extraordinary\\n', 'manner.  I desired he would order several sticks of two feet high, and\\n', 'the thickness of an ordinary cane, to be brought me; whereupon his\\n', 'majesty commanded the master of his woods to give directions accordingly;\\n', 'and the next morning six woodmen arrived with as many carriages, drawn by\\n', 'eight horses to each.  I took nine of these sticks, and fixing them\\n', 'firmly in the ground in a quadrangular figure, two feet and a half\\n', 'square, I took four other sticks, and tied them parallel at each corner,\\n', 'about two feet from the ground; then I fastened my handkerchief to the\\n', 'nine sticks that stood erect; and extended it on all sides, till it was\\n', 'tight as the top of a drum; and the four parallel sticks, rising about\\n', 'five inches higher than the handkerchief, served as ledges on each side.\\n', 'When I had finished my work, I desired the emperor to let a troop of his\\n', 'best horses twenty-four in number, come and exercise upon this plain.\\n', 'His majesty approved of the proposal, and I took them up, one by one, in\\n', 'my hands, ready mounted and armed, with the proper officers to exercise\\n', 'them.  As soon as they got into order they divided into two parties,\\n', 'performed mock skirmishes, discharged blunt arrows, drew their swords,\\n', 'fled and pursued, attacked and retired, and in short discovered the best\\n', 'military discipline I ever beheld.  The parallel sticks secured them and\\n', 'their horses from falling over the stage; and the emperor was so much\\n', 'delighted, that he ordered this entertainment to be repeated several\\n', 'days, and once was pleased to be lifted up and give the word of command;\\n', 'and with great difficulty persuaded even the empress herself to let me\\n', 'hold her in her close chair within two yards of the stage, when she was\\n', 'able to take a full view of the whole performance.  It was my good\\n', 'fortune, that no ill accident happened in these entertainments; only once\\n', 'a fiery horse, that belonged to one of the captains, pawing with his\\n', 'hoof, struck a hole in my handkerchief, and his foot slipping, he\\n', 'overthrew his rider and himself; but I immediately relieved them both,\\n', 'and covering the hole with one hand, I set down the troop with the other,\\n', 'in the same manner as I took them up. The horse that fell was strained in\\n', 'the left shoulder, but the rider got no hurt; and I repaired my\\n', 'handkerchief as well as I could: however, I would not trust to the\\n', 'strength of it any more, in such dangerous enterprises.\\n', '\\n', 'About two or three days before I was set at liberty, as I was\\n', 'entertaining the court with this kind of feat, there arrived an express\\n', 'to inform his majesty, that some of his subjects, riding near the place\\n', 'where I was first taken up, had seen a great black substance lying on the\\n', 'around, very oddly shaped, extending its edges round, as wide as his\\n', 'majesty’s bedchamber, and rising up in the middle as high as a man; that\\n', 'it was no living creature, as they at first apprehended, for it lay on\\n', 'the grass without motion; and some of them had walked round it several\\n', 'times; that, by mounting upon each other’s shoulders, they had got to the\\n', 'top, which was flat and even, and, stamping upon it, they found that it\\n', 'was hollow within; that they humbly conceived it might be something\\n', 'belonging to the man-mountain; and if his majesty pleased, they would\\n', 'undertake to bring it with only five horses.  I presently knew what they\\n', 'meant, and was glad at heart to receive this intelligence.  It seems,\\n', 'upon my first reaching the shore after our shipwreck, I was in such\\n', 'confusion, that before I came to the place where I went to sleep, my hat,\\n', 'which I had fastened with a string to my head while I was rowing, and had\\n', 'stuck on all the time I was swimming, fell off after I came to land; the\\n', 'string, as I conjecture, breaking by some accident, which I never\\n', 'observed, but thought my hat had been lost at sea.  I entreated his\\n', 'imperial majesty to give orders it might be brought to me as soon as\\n', 'possible, describing to him the use and the nature of it: and the next\\n', 'day the waggoners arrived with it, but not in a very good condition; they\\n', 'had bored two holes in the brim, within an inch and half of the edge, and\\n', 'fastened two hooks in the holes; these hooks were tied by a long cord to\\n', 'the harness, and thus my hat was dragged along for above half an English\\n', 'mile; but, the ground in that country being extremely smooth and level,\\n', 'it received less damage than I expected.\\n', '\\n', 'Two days after this adventure, the emperor, having ordered that part of\\n', 'his army which quarters in and about his metropolis, to be in readiness,\\n', 'took a fancy of diverting himself in a very singular manner.  He desired\\n', 'I would stand like a Colossus, with my legs as far asunder as I\\n', 'conveniently could.  He then commanded his general (who was an old\\n', 'experienced leader, and a great patron of mine) to draw up the troops in\\n', 'close order, and march them under me; the foot by twenty-four abreast,\\n', 'and the horse by sixteen, with drums beating, colours flying, and pikes\\n', 'advanced.  This body consisted of three thousand foot, and a thousand\\n', 'horse.  His majesty gave orders, upon pain of death, that every soldier\\n', 'in his march should observe the strictest decency with regard to my\\n', 'person; which however could not prevent some of the younger officers from\\n', 'turning up their eyes as they passed under me: and, to confess the truth,\\n', 'my breeches were at that time in so ill a condition, that they afforded\\n', 'some opportunities for laughter and admiration.\\n', '\\n', 'I had sent so many memorials and petitions for my liberty, that his\\n', 'majesty at length mentioned the matter, first in the cabinet, and then in\\n', 'a full council; where it was opposed by none, except Skyresh Bolgolam,\\n', 'who was pleased, without any provocation, to be my mortal enemy.  But it\\n', 'was carried against him by the whole board, and confirmed by the emperor.\\n', 'That minister was _galbet_, or admiral of the realm, very much in his\\n', 'master’s confidence, and a person well versed in affairs, but of a morose\\n', 'and sour complexion.  However, he was at length persuaded to comply; but\\n', 'prevailed that the articles and conditions upon which I should be set\\n', 'free, and to which I must swear, should be drawn up by himself.  These\\n', 'articles were brought to me by Skyresh Bolgolam in person attended by two\\n', 'under-secretaries, and several persons of distinction.  After they were\\n', 'read, I was demanded to swear to the performance of them; first in the\\n', 'manner of my own country, and afterwards in the method prescribed by\\n', 'their laws; which was, to hold my right foot in my left hand, and to\\n', 'place the middle finger of my right hand on the crown of my head, and my\\n', 'thumb on the tip of my right ear.  But because the reader may be curious\\n', 'to have some idea of the style and manner of expression peculiar to that\\n', 'people, as well as to know the article upon which I recovered my liberty,\\n', 'I have made a translation of the whole instrument, word for word, as near\\n', 'as I was able, which I here offer to the public.\\n', '\\n', '“Golbasto Momarem Evlame Gurdilo Shefin Mully Ully Gue, most mighty\\n', 'Emperor of Lilliput, delight and terror of the universe, whose dominions\\n', 'extend five thousand _blustrugs_ (about twelve miles in circumference) to\\n', 'the extremities of the globe; monarch of all monarchs, taller than the\\n', 'sons of men; whose feet press down to the centre, and whose head strikes\\n', 'against the sun; at whose nod the princes of the earth shake their knees;\\n', 'pleasant as the spring, comfortable as the summer, fruitful as autumn,\\n', 'dreadful as winter: his most sublime majesty proposes to the\\n', 'man-mountain, lately arrived at our celestial dominions, the following\\n', 'articles, which, by a solemn oath, he shall be obliged to perform:—\\n', '\\n', '“1st, The man-mountain shall not depart from our dominions, without our\\n', 'license under our great seal.\\n', '\\n', '“2d, He shall not presume to come into our metropolis, without our\\n', 'express order; at which time, the inhabitants shall have two hours\\n', 'warning to keep within doors.\\n', '\\n', '“3d, The said man-mountain shall confine his walks to our principal high\\n', 'roads, and not offer to walk, or lie down, in a meadow or field of corn.\\n', '\\n', '“4th, As he walks the said roads, he shall take the utmost care not to\\n', 'trample upon the bodies of any of our loving subjects, their horses, or\\n', 'carriages, nor take any of our subjects into his hands without their own\\n', 'consent.\\n', '\\n', '“5th, If an express requires extraordinary despatch, the man-mountain\\n', 'shall be obliged to carry, in his pocket, the messenger and horse a six\\n', 'days journey, once in every moon, and return the said messenger back (if\\n', 'so required) safe to our imperial presence.\\n', '\\n', '“6th, He shall be our ally against our enemies in the island of Blefuscu,\\n', 'and do his utmost to destroy their fleet, which is now preparing to\\n', 'invade us.\\n', '\\n', '“7th, That the said man-mountain shall, at his times of leisure, be\\n', 'aiding and assisting to our workmen, in helping to raise certain great\\n', 'stones, towards covering the wall of the principal park, and other our\\n', 'royal buildings.\\n', '\\n', '“8th, That the said man-mountain shall, in two moons’ time, deliver in an\\n', 'exact survey of the circumference of our dominions, by a computation of\\n', 'his own paces round the coast.\\n', '\\n', '“Lastly, That, upon his solemn oath to observe all the above articles,\\n', 'the said man-mountain shall have a daily allowance of meat and drink\\n', 'sufficient for the support of 1724 of our subjects, with free access to\\n', 'our royal person, and other marks of our favour.  Given at our palace at\\n', 'Belfaborac, the twelfth day of the ninety-first moon of our reign.”\\n', '\\n', 'I swore and subscribed to these articles with great cheerfulness and\\n', 'content, although some of them were not so honourable as I could have\\n', 'wished; which proceeded wholly from the malice of Skyresh Bolgolam, the\\n', 'high-admiral: whereupon my chains were immediately unlocked, and I was at\\n', 'full liberty.  The emperor himself, in person, did me the honour to be by\\n', 'at the whole ceremony.  I made my acknowledgements by prostrating myself\\n', 'at his majesty’s feet: but he commanded me to rise; and after many\\n', 'gracious expressions, which, to avoid the censure of vanity, I shall not\\n', 'repeat, he added, “that he hoped I should prove a useful servant, and\\n', 'well deserve all the favours he had already conferred upon me, or might\\n', 'do for the future.”\\n', '\\n', 'The reader may please to observe, that, in the last article of the\\n', 'recovery of my liberty, the emperor stipulates to allow me a quantity of\\n', 'meat and drink sufficient for the support of 1724 Lilliputians.  Some\\n', 'time after, asking a friend at court how they came to fix on that\\n', 'determinate number, he told me that his majesty’s mathematicians, having\\n', 'taken the height of my body by the help of a quadrant, and finding it to\\n', 'exceed theirs in the proportion of twelve to one, they concluded from the\\n', 'similarity of their bodies, that mine must contain at least 1724 of\\n', 'theirs, and consequently would require as much food as was necessary to\\n', 'support that number of Lilliputians.  By which the reader may conceive an\\n', 'idea of the ingenuity of that people, as well as the prudent and exact\\n', 'economy of so great a prince.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER IV.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Mildendo, the metropolis of Lilliput, described, together with the\\n', 'emperor’s palace.  A conversation between the author and a principal\\n', 'secretary, concerning the affairs of that empire.  The author’s offers to\\n', 'serve the emperor in his wars.\\n', '\\n', 'The first request I made, after I had obtained my liberty, was, that I\\n', 'might have license to see Mildendo, the metropolis; which the emperor\\n', 'easily granted me, but with a special charge to do no hurt either to the\\n', 'inhabitants or their houses.  The people had notice, by proclamation, of\\n', 'my design to visit the town.  The wall which encompassed it is two feet\\n', 'and a half high, and at least eleven inches broad, so that a coach and\\n', 'horses may be driven very safely round it; and it is flanked with strong\\n', 'towers at ten feet distance.  I stepped over the great western gate, and\\n', 'passed very gently, and sidling, through the two principal streets, only\\n', 'in my short waistcoat, for fear of damaging the roofs and eaves of the\\n', 'houses with the skirts of my coat.  I walked with the utmost\\n', 'circumspection, to avoid treading on any stragglers who might remain in\\n', 'the streets, although the orders were very strict, that all people should\\n', 'keep in their houses, at their own peril.  The garret windows and tops of\\n', 'houses were so crowded with spectators, that I thought in all my travels\\n', 'I had not seen a more populous place.  The city is an exact square, each\\n', 'side of the wall being five hundred feet long.  The two great streets,\\n', 'which run across and divide it into four quarters, are five feet wide.\\n', 'The lanes and alleys, which I could not enter, but only view them as I\\n', 'passed, are from twelve to eighteen inches.  The town is capable of\\n', 'holding five hundred thousand souls: the houses are from three to five\\n', 'stories: the shops and markets well provided.\\n', '\\n', 'The emperor’s palace is in the centre of the city where the two great\\n', 'streets meet.  It is enclosed by a wall of two feet high, and twenty feet\\n', 'distance from the buildings.  I had his majesty’s permission to step over\\n', 'this wall; and, the space being so wide between that and the palace, I\\n', 'could easily view it on every side.  The outward court is a square of\\n', 'forty feet, and includes two other courts: in the inmost are the royal\\n', 'apartments, which I was very desirous to see, but found it extremely\\n', 'difficult; for the great gates, from one square into another, were but\\n', 'eighteen inches high, and seven inches wide.  Now the buildings of the\\n', 'outer court were at least five feet high, and it was impossible for me to\\n', 'stride over them without infinite damage to the pile, though the walls\\n', 'were strongly built of hewn stone, and four inches thick.  At the same\\n', 'time the emperor had a great desire that I should see the magnificence of\\n', 'his palace; but this I was not able to do till three days after, which I\\n', 'spent in cutting down with my knife some of the largest trees in the\\n', 'royal park, about a hundred yards distant from the city.  Of these trees\\n', 'I made two stools, each about three feet high, and strong enough to bear\\n', 'my weight.  The people having received notice a second time, I went again\\n', 'through the city to the palace with my two stools in my hands.  When I\\n', 'came to the side of the outer court, I stood upon one stool, and took the\\n', 'other in my hand; this I lifted over the roof, and gently set it down on\\n', 'the space between the first and second court, which was eight feet wide.\\n', 'I then stept over the building very conveniently from one stool to the\\n', 'other, and drew up the first after me with a hooked stick.  By this\\n', 'contrivance I got into the inmost court; and, lying down upon my side, I\\n', 'applied my face to the windows of the middle stories, which were left\\n', 'open on purpose, and discovered the most splendid apartments that can be\\n', 'imagined.  There I saw the empress and the young princes, in their\\n', 'several lodgings, with their chief attendants about them.  Her imperial\\n', 'majesty was pleased to smile very graciously upon me, and gave me out of\\n', 'the window her hand to kiss.\\n', '\\n', 'But I shall not anticipate the reader with further descriptions of this\\n', 'kind, because I reserve them for a greater work, which is now almost\\n', 'ready for the press; containing a general description of this empire,\\n', 'from its first erection, through along series of princes; with a\\n', 'particular account of their wars and politics, laws, learning, and\\n', 'religion; their plants and animals; their peculiar manners and customs,\\n', 'with other matters very curious and useful; my chief design at present\\n', 'being only to relate such events and transactions as happened to the\\n', 'public or to myself during a residence of about nine months in that\\n', 'empire.\\n', '\\n', 'One morning, about a fortnight after I had obtained my liberty,\\n', 'Reldresal, principal secretary (as they style him) for private affairs,\\n', 'came to my house attended only by one servant.  He ordered his coach to\\n', 'wait at a distance, and desired I would give him an hours audience; which\\n', 'I readily consented to, on account of his quality and personal merits, as\\n', 'well as of the many good offices he had done me during my solicitations\\n', 'at court.  I offered to lie down that he might the more conveniently\\n', 'reach my ear, but he chose rather to let me hold him in my hand during\\n', 'our conversation.  He began with compliments on my liberty; said “he\\n', 'might pretend to some merit in it;” but, however, added, “that if it had\\n', 'not been for the present situation of things at court, perhaps I might\\n', 'not have obtained it so soon.  For,” said he, “as flourishing a condition\\n', 'as we may appear to be in to foreigners, we labour under two mighty\\n', 'evils: a violent faction at home, and the danger of an invasion, by a\\n', 'most potent enemy, from abroad.  As to the first, you are to understand,\\n', 'that for about seventy moons past there have been two struggling parties\\n', 'in this empire, under the names of _Tramecksan_ and _Slamecksan_, from\\n', 'the high and low heels of their shoes, by which they distinguish\\n', 'themselves.  It is alleged, indeed, that the high heels are most\\n', 'agreeable to our ancient constitution; but, however this be, his majesty\\n', 'has determined to make use only of low heels in the administration of the\\n', 'government, and all offices in the gift of the crown, as you cannot but\\n', 'observe; and particularly that his majesty’s imperial heels are lower at\\n', 'least by a _drurr_ than any of his court (_drurr_ is a measure about the\\n', 'fourteenth part of an inch).  The animosities between these two parties\\n', 'run so high, that they will neither eat, nor drink, nor talk with each\\n', 'other.  We compute the _Tramecksan_, or high heels, to exceed us in\\n', 'number; but the power is wholly on our side.  We apprehend his imperial\\n', 'highness, the heir to the crown, to have some tendency towards the high\\n', 'heels; at least we can plainly discover that one of his heels is higher\\n', 'than the other, which gives him a hobble in his gait.  Now, in the midst\\n', 'of these intestine disquiets, we are threatened with an invasion from the\\n', 'island of Blefuscu, which is the other great empire of the universe,\\n', 'almost as large and powerful as this of his majesty.  For as to what we\\n', 'have heard you affirm, that there are other kingdoms and states in the\\n', 'world inhabited by human creatures as large as yourself, our philosophers\\n', 'are in much doubt, and would rather conjecture that you dropped from the\\n', 'moon, or one of the stars; because it is certain, that a hundred mortals\\n', 'of your bulk would in a short time destroy all the fruits and cattle of\\n', 'his majesty’s dominions: besides, our histories of six thousand moons\\n', 'make no mention of any other regions than the two great empires of\\n', 'Lilliput and Blefuscu.  Which two mighty powers have, as I was going to\\n', 'tell you, been engaged in a most obstinate war for six-and-thirty moons\\n', 'past.  It began upon the following occasion.  It is allowed on all hands,\\n', 'that the primitive way of breaking eggs, before we eat them, was upon the\\n', 'larger end; but his present majesty’s grandfather, while he was a boy,\\n', 'going to eat an egg, and breaking it according to the ancient practice,\\n', 'happened to cut one of his fingers.  Whereupon the emperor his father\\n', 'published an edict, commanding all his subjects, upon great penalties, to\\n', 'break the smaller end of their eggs.  The people so highly resented this\\n', 'law, that our histories tell us, there have been six rebellions raised on\\n', 'that account; wherein one emperor lost his life, and another his crown.\\n', 'These civil commotions were constantly fomented by the monarchs of\\n', 'Blefuscu; and when they were quelled, the exiles always fled for refuge\\n', 'to that empire.  It is computed that eleven thousand persons have at\\n', 'several times suffered death, rather than submit to break their eggs at\\n', 'the smaller end.  Many hundred large volumes have been published upon\\n', 'this controversy: but the books of the Big-endians have been long\\n', 'forbidden, and the whole party rendered incapable by law of holding\\n', 'employments.  During the course of these troubles, the emperors of\\n', 'Blefusca did frequently expostulate by their ambassadors, accusing us of\\n', 'making a schism in religion, by offending against a fundamental doctrine\\n', 'of our great prophet Lustrog, in the fifty-fourth chapter of the\\n', 'Blundecral (which is their Alcoran).  This, however, is thought to be a\\n', 'mere strain upon the text; for the words are these: ‘that all true\\n', 'believers break their eggs at the convenient end.’  And which is the\\n', 'convenient end, seems, in my humble opinion to be left to every man’s\\n', 'conscience, or at least in the power of the chief magistrate to\\n', 'determine.  Now, the Big-endian exiles have found so much credit in the\\n', 'emperor of Blefuscu’s court, and so much private assistance and\\n', 'encouragement from their party here at home, that a bloody war has been\\n', 'carried on between the two empires for six-and-thirty moons, with various\\n', 'success; during which time we have lost forty capital ships, and a much a\\n', 'greater number of smaller vessels, together with thirty thousand of our\\n', 'best seamen and soldiers; and the damage received by the enemy is\\n', 'reckoned to be somewhat greater than ours.  However, they have now\\n', 'equipped a numerous fleet, and are just preparing to make a descent upon\\n', 'us; and his imperial majesty, placing great confidence in your valour and\\n', 'strength, has commanded me to lay this account of his affairs before\\n', 'you.”\\n', '\\n', 'I desired the secretary to present my humble duty to the emperor; and to\\n', 'let him know, “that I thought it would not become me, who was a\\n', 'foreigner, to interfere with parties; but I was ready, with the hazard of\\n', 'my life, to defend his person and state against all invaders.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER V.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The author, by an extraordinary stratagem, prevents an invasion.  A high\\n', 'title of honour is conferred upon him.  Ambassadors arrive from the\\n', 'emperor of Blefuscu, and sue for peace.  The empress’s apartment on fire\\n', 'by an accident; the author instrumental in saving the rest of the palace.\\n', '\\n', 'The empire of Blefuscu is an island situated to the north-east of\\n', 'Lilliput, from which it is parted only by a channel of eight hundred\\n', 'yards wide.  I had not yet seen it, and upon this notice of an intended\\n', 'invasion, I avoided appearing on that side of the coast, for fear of\\n', 'being discovered, by some of the enemy’s ships, who had received no\\n', 'intelligence of me; all intercourse between the two empires having been\\n', 'strictly forbidden during the war, upon pain of death, and an embargo\\n', 'laid by our emperor upon all vessels whatsoever.  I communicated to his\\n', 'majesty a project I had formed of seizing the enemy’s whole fleet; which,\\n', 'as our scouts assured us, lay at anchor in the harbour, ready to sail\\n', 'with the first fair wind.  I consulted the most experienced seamen upon\\n', 'the depth of the channel, which they had often plumbed; who told me, that\\n', 'in the middle, at high-water, it was seventy _glumgluffs_ deep, which is\\n', 'about six feet of European measure; and the rest of it fifty _glumgluffs_\\n', 'at most.  I walked towards the north-east coast, over against Blefuscu,\\n', 'where, lying down behind a hillock, I took out my small perspective\\n', 'glass, and viewed the enemy’s fleet at anchor, consisting of about fifty\\n', 'men of war, and a great number of transports: I then came back to my\\n', 'house, and gave orders (for which I had a warrant) for a great quantity\\n', 'of the strongest cable and bars of iron.  The cable was about as thick as\\n', 'packthread and the bars of the length and size of a knitting-needle.  I\\n', 'trebled the cable to make it stronger, and for the same reason I twisted\\n', 'three of the iron bars together, bending the extremities into a hook.\\n', 'Having thus fixed fifty hooks to as many cables, I went back to the\\n', 'north-east coast, and putting off my coat, shoes, and stockings, walked\\n', 'into the sea, in my leathern jerkin, about half an hour before high\\n', 'water.  I waded with what haste I could, and swam in the middle about\\n', 'thirty yards, till I felt ground.  I arrived at the fleet in less than\\n', 'half an hour.  The enemy was so frightened when they saw me, that they\\n', 'leaped out of their ships, and swam to shore, where there could not be\\n', 'fewer than thirty thousand souls.  I then took my tackling, and,\\n', 'fastening a hook to the hole at the prow of each, I tied all the cords\\n', 'together at the end.  While I was thus employed, the enemy discharged\\n', 'several thousand arrows, many of which stuck in my hands and face, and,\\n', 'beside the excessive smart, gave me much disturbance in my work.  My\\n', 'greatest apprehension was for mine eyes, which I should have infallibly\\n', 'lost, if I had not suddenly thought of an expedient.  I kept, among other\\n', 'little necessaries, a pair of spectacles in a private pocket, which, as I\\n', 'observed before, had escaped the emperor’s searchers.  These I took out\\n', 'and fastened as strongly as I could upon my nose, and thus armed, went on\\n', 'boldly with my work, in spite of the enemy’s arrows, many of which struck\\n', 'against the glasses of my spectacles, but without any other effect,\\n', 'further than a little to discompose them.  I had now fastened all the\\n', 'hooks, and, taking the knot in my hand, began to pull; but not a ship\\n', 'would stir, for they were all too fast held by their anchors, so that the\\n', 'boldest part of my enterprise remained.  I therefore let go the cord, and\\n', 'leaving the looks fixed to the ships, I resolutely cut with my knife the\\n', 'cables that fastened the anchors, receiving about two hundred shots in my\\n', 'face and hands; then I took up the knotted end of the cables, to which my\\n', 'hooks were tied, and with great ease drew fifty of the enemy’s largest\\n', 'men of war after me.\\n', '\\n', 'The Blefuscudians, who had not the least imagination of what I intended,\\n', 'were at first confounded with astonishment.  They had seen me cut the\\n', 'cables, and thought my design was only to let the ships run adrift or\\n', 'fall foul on each other: but when they perceived the whole fleet moving\\n', 'in order, and saw me pulling at the end, they set up such a scream of\\n', 'grief and despair as it is almost impossible to describe or conceive.\\n', 'When I had got out of danger, I stopped awhile to pick out the arrows\\n', 'that stuck in my hands and face; and rubbed on some of the same ointment\\n', 'that was given me at my first arrival, as I have formerly mentioned.  I\\n', 'then took off my spectacles, and waiting about an hour, till the tide was\\n', 'a little fallen, I waded through the middle with my cargo, and arrived\\n', 'safe at the royal port of Lilliput.\\n', '\\n', 'The emperor and his whole court stood on the shore, expecting the issue\\n', 'of this great adventure.  They saw the ships move forward in a large\\n', 'half-moon, but could not discern me, who was up to my breast in water.\\n', 'When I advanced to the middle of the channel, they were yet more in pain,\\n', 'because I was under water to my neck.  The emperor concluded me to be\\n', 'drowned, and that the enemy’s fleet was approaching in a hostile manner:\\n', 'but he was soon eased of his fears; for the channel growing shallower\\n', 'every step I made, I came in a short time within hearing, and holding up\\n', 'the end of the cable, by which the fleet was fastened, I cried in a loud\\n', 'voice, “Long live the most puissant king of Lilliput!”  This great prince\\n', 'received me at my landing with all possible encomiums, and created me a\\n', '_nardac_ upon the spot, which is the highest title of honour among them.\\n', '\\n', 'His majesty desired I would take some other opportunity of bringing all\\n', 'the rest of his enemy’s ships into his ports.  And so unmeasureable is\\n', 'the ambition of princes, that he seemed to think of nothing less than\\n', 'reducing the whole empire of Blefuscu into a province, and governing it,\\n', 'by a viceroy; of destroying the Big-endian exiles, and compelling that\\n', 'people to break the smaller end of their eggs, by which he would remain\\n', 'the sole monarch of the whole world.  But I endeavoured to divert him\\n', 'from this design, by many arguments drawn from the topics of policy as\\n', 'well as justice; and I plainly protested, “that I would never be an\\n', 'instrument of bringing a free and brave people into slavery.”  And, when\\n', 'the matter was debated in council, the wisest part of the ministry were\\n', 'of my opinion.\\n', '\\n', 'This open bold declaration of mine was so opposite to the schemes and\\n', 'politics of his imperial majesty, that he could never forgive me.  He\\n', 'mentioned it in a very artful manner at council, where I was told that\\n', 'some of the wisest appeared, at least by their silence, to be of my\\n', 'opinion; but others, who were my secret enemies, could not forbear some\\n', 'expressions which, by a side-wind, reflected on me.  And from this time\\n', 'began an intrigue between his majesty and a junto of ministers,\\n', 'maliciously bent against me, which broke out in less than two months, and\\n', 'had like to have ended in my utter destruction.  Of so little weight are\\n', 'the greatest services to princes, when put into the balance with a\\n', 'refusal to gratify their passions.\\n', '\\n', 'About three weeks after this exploit, there arrived a solemn embassy from\\n', 'Blefuscu, with humble offers of a peace, which was soon concluded, upon\\n', 'conditions very advantageous to our emperor, wherewith I shall not\\n', 'trouble the reader.  There were six ambassadors, with a train of about\\n', 'five hundred persons, and their entry was very magnificent, suitable to\\n', 'the grandeur of their master, and the importance of their business.  When\\n', 'their treaty was finished, wherein I did them several good offices by the\\n', 'credit I now had, or at least appeared to have, at court, their\\n', 'excellencies, who were privately told how much I had been their friend,\\n', 'made me a visit in form.  They began with many compliments upon my valour\\n', 'and generosity, invited me to that kingdom in the emperor their master’s\\n', 'name, and desired me to show them some proofs of my prodigious strength,\\n', 'of which they had heard so many wonders; wherein I readily obliged them,\\n', 'but shall not trouble the reader with the particulars.\\n', '\\n', 'When I had for some time entertained their excellencies, to their\\n', 'infinite satisfaction and surprise, I desired they would do me the honour\\n', 'to present my most humble respects to the emperor their master, the\\n', 'renown of whose virtues had so justly filled the whole world with\\n', 'admiration, and whose royal person I resolved to attend, before I\\n', 'returned to my own country.  Accordingly, the next time I had the honour\\n', 'to see our emperor, I desired his general license to wait on the\\n', 'Blefuscudian monarch, which he was pleased to grant me, as I could\\n', 'perceive, in a very cold manner; but could not guess the reason, till I\\n', 'had a whisper from a certain person, “that Flimnap and Bolgolam had\\n', 'represented my intercourse with those ambassadors as a mark of\\n', 'disaffection;” from which I am sure my heart was wholly free.  And this\\n', 'was the first time I began to conceive some imperfect idea of courts and\\n', 'ministers.\\n', '\\n', 'It is to be observed, that these ambassadors spoke to me, by an\\n', 'interpreter, the languages of both empires differing as much from each\\n', 'other as any two in Europe, and each nation priding itself upon the\\n', 'antiquity, beauty, and energy of their own tongue, with an avowed\\n', 'contempt for that of their neighbour; yet our emperor, standing upon the\\n', 'advantage he had got by the seizure of their fleet, obliged them to\\n', 'deliver their credentials, and make their speech, in the Lilliputian\\n', 'tongue.  And it must be confessed, that from the great intercourse of\\n', 'trade and commerce between both realms, from the continual reception of\\n', 'exiles which is mutual among them, and from the custom, in each empire,\\n', 'to send their young nobility and richer gentry to the other, in order to\\n', 'polish themselves by seeing the world, and understanding men and manners;\\n', 'there are few persons of distinction, or merchants, or seamen, who dwell\\n', 'in the maritime parts, but what can hold conversation in both tongues; as\\n', 'I found some weeks after, when I went to pay my respects to the emperor\\n', 'of Blefuscu, which, in the midst of great misfortunes, through the malice\\n', 'of my enemies, proved a very happy adventure to me, as I shall relate in\\n', 'its proper place.\\n', '\\n', 'The reader may remember, that when I signed those articles upon which I\\n', 'recovered my liberty, there were some which I disliked, upon account of\\n', 'their being too servile; neither could anything but an extreme necessity\\n', 'have forced me to submit.  But being now a _nardac_ of the highest rank\\n', 'in that empire, such offices were looked upon as below my dignity, and\\n', 'the emperor (to do him justice), never once mentioned them to me.\\n', 'However, it was not long before I had an opportunity of doing his\\n', 'majesty, at least as I then thought, a most signal service.  I was\\n', 'alarmed at midnight with the cries of many hundred people at my door; by\\n', 'which, being suddenly awaked, I was in some kind of terror.  I heard the\\n', 'word _Burglum_ repeated incessantly: several of the emperor’s court,\\n', 'making their way through the crowd, entreated me to come immediately to\\n', 'the palace, where her imperial majesty’s apartment was on fire, by the\\n', 'carelessness of a maid of honour, who fell asleep while she was reading a\\n', 'romance.  I got up in an instant; and orders being given to clear the way\\n', 'before me, and it being likewise a moonshine night, I made a shift to get\\n', 'to the palace without trampling on any of the people.  I found they had\\n', 'already applied ladders to the walls of the apartment, and were well\\n', 'provided with buckets, but the water was at some distance.  These buckets\\n', 'were about the size of large thimbles, and the poor people supplied me\\n', 'with them as fast as they could: but the flame was so violent that they\\n', 'did little good.  I might easily have stifled it with my coat, which I\\n', 'unfortunately left behind me for haste, and came away only in my leathern\\n', 'jerkin.  The case seemed wholly desperate and deplorable; and this\\n', 'magnificent palace would have infallibly been burnt down to the ground,\\n', 'if, by a presence of mind unusual to me, I had not suddenly thought of an\\n', 'expedient.  I had, the evening before, drunk plentifully of a most\\n', 'delicious wine called _glimigrim_, (the Blefuscudians call it _flunec_,\\n', 'but ours is esteemed the better sort,) which is very diuretic.  By the\\n', 'luckiest chance in the world, I had not discharged myself of any part of\\n', 'it.  The heat I had contracted by coming very near the flames, and by\\n', 'labouring to quench them, made the wine begin to operate by urine; which\\n', 'I voided in such a quantity, and applied so well to the proper places,\\n', 'that in three minutes the fire was wholly extinguished, and the rest of\\n', 'that noble pile, which had cost so many ages in erecting, preserved from\\n', 'destruction.\\n', '\\n', 'It was now day-light, and I returned to my house without waiting to\\n', 'congratulate with the emperor: because, although I had done a very\\n', 'eminent piece of service, yet I could not tell how his majesty might\\n', 'resent the manner by which I had performed it: for, by the fundamental\\n', 'laws of the realm, it is capital in any person, of what quality soever,\\n', 'to make water within the precincts of the palace.  But I was a little\\n', 'comforted by a message from his majesty, “that he would give orders to\\n', 'the grand justiciary for passing my pardon in form:” which, however, I\\n', 'could not obtain; and I was privately assured, “that the empress,\\n', 'conceiving the greatest abhorrence of what I had done, removed to the\\n', 'most distant side of the court, firmly resolved that those buildings\\n', 'should never be repaired for her use: and, in the presence of her chief\\n', 'confidents could not forbear vowing revenge.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER VI.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Of the inhabitants of Lilliput; their learning, laws, and customs; the\\n', 'manner of educating their children.  The author’s way of living in that\\n', 'country.  His vindication of a great lady.\\n', '\\n', 'Although I intend to leave the description of this empire to a particular\\n', 'treatise, yet, in the mean time, I am content to gratify the curious\\n', 'reader with some general ideas.  As the common size of the natives is\\n', 'somewhat under six inches high, so there is an exact proportion in all\\n', 'other animals, as well as plants and trees: for instance, the tallest\\n', 'horses and oxen are between four and five inches in height, the sheep an\\n', 'inch and half, more or less: their geese about the bigness of a sparrow,\\n', 'and so the several gradations downwards till you come to the smallest,\\n', 'which to my sight, were almost invisible; but nature has adapted the eyes\\n', 'of the Lilliputians to all objects proper for their view: they see with\\n', 'great exactness, but at no great distance.  And, to show the sharpness of\\n', 'their sight towards objects that are near, I have been much pleased with\\n', 'observing a cook pulling a lark, which was not so large as a common fly;\\n', 'and a young girl threading an invisible needle with invisible silk.\\n', 'Their tallest trees are about seven feet high: I mean some of those in\\n', 'the great royal park, the tops whereof I could but just reach with my\\n', 'fist clenched.  The other vegetables are in the same proportion; but this\\n', 'I leave to the reader’s imagination.\\n', '\\n', 'I shall say but little at present of their learning, which, for many\\n', 'ages, has flourished in all its branches among them: but their manner of\\n', 'writing is very peculiar, being neither from the left to the right, like\\n', 'the Europeans, nor from the right to the left, like the Arabians, nor\\n', 'from up to down, like the Chinese, but aslant, from one corner of the\\n', 'paper to the other, like ladies in England.\\n', '\\n', 'They bury their dead with their heads directly downward, because they\\n', 'hold an opinion, that in eleven thousand moons they are all to rise\\n', 'again; in which period the earth (which they conceive to be flat) will\\n', 'turn upside down, and by this means they shall, at their resurrection, be\\n', 'found ready standing on their feet.  The learned among them confess the\\n', 'absurdity of this doctrine; but the practice still continues, in\\n', 'compliance to the vulgar.\\n', '\\n', 'There are some laws and customs in this empire very peculiar; and if they\\n', 'were not so directly contrary to those of my own dear country, I should\\n', 'be tempted to say a little in their justification.  It is only to be\\n', 'wished they were as well executed.  The first I shall mention, relates to\\n', 'informers.  All crimes against the state, are punished here with the\\n', 'utmost severity; but, if the person accused makes his innocence plainly\\n', 'to appear upon his trial, the accuser is immediately put to an\\n', 'ignominious death; and out of his goods or lands the innocent person is\\n', 'quadruply recompensed for the loss of his time, for the danger he\\n', 'underwent, for the hardship of his imprisonment, and for all the charges\\n', 'he has been at in making his defence; or, if that fund be deficient, it\\n', 'is largely supplied by the crown.  The emperor also confers on him some\\n', 'public mark of his favour, and proclamation is made of his innocence\\n', 'through the whole city.\\n', '\\n', 'They look upon fraud as a greater crime than theft, and therefore seldom\\n', 'fail to punish it with death; for they allege, that care and vigilance,\\n', 'with a very common understanding, may preserve a man’s goods from\\n', 'thieves, but honesty has no defence against superior cunning; and, since\\n', 'it is necessary that there should be a perpetual intercourse of buying\\n', 'and selling, and dealing upon credit, where fraud is permitted and\\n', 'connived at, or has no law to punish it, the honest dealer is always\\n', 'undone, and the knave gets the advantage.  I remember, when I was once\\n', 'interceding with the emperor for a criminal who had wronged his master of\\n', 'a great sum of money, which he had received by order and ran away with;\\n', 'and happening to tell his majesty, by way of extenuation, that it was\\n', 'only a breach of trust, the emperor thought it monstrous in me to offer\\n', 'as a defence the greatest aggravation of the crime; and truly I had\\n', 'little to say in return, farther than the common answer, that different\\n', 'nations had different customs; for, I confess, I was heartily ashamed.\\n', '{330}\\n', '\\n', 'Although we usually call reward and punishment the two hinges upon which\\n', 'all government turns, yet I could never observe this maxim to be put in\\n', 'practice by any nation except that of Lilliput.  Whoever can there bring\\n', 'sufficient proof, that he has strictly observed the laws of his country\\n', 'for seventy-three moons, has a claim to certain privileges, according to\\n', 'his quality or condition of life, with a proportionable sum of money out\\n', 'of a fund appropriated for that use: he likewise acquires the title of\\n', '_snilpall_, or legal, which is added to his name, but does not descend to\\n', 'his posterity.  And these people thought it a prodigious defect of policy\\n', 'among us, when I told them that our laws were enforced only by penalties,\\n', 'without any mention of reward.  It is upon this account that the image of\\n', 'Justice, in their courts of judicature, is formed with six eyes, two\\n', 'before, as many behind, and on each side one, to signify circumspection;\\n', 'with a bag of gold open in her right hand, and a sword sheathed in her\\n', 'left, to show she is more disposed to reward than to punish.\\n', '\\n', 'In choosing persons for all employments, they have more regard to good\\n', 'morals than to great abilities; for, since government is necessary to\\n', 'mankind, they believe, that the common size of human understanding is\\n', 'fitted to some station or other; and that Providence never intended to\\n', 'make the management of public affairs a mystery to be comprehended only\\n', 'by a few persons of sublime genius, of which there seldom are three born\\n', 'in an age: but they suppose truth, justice, temperance, and the like, to\\n', 'be in every man’s power; the practice of which virtues, assisted by\\n', 'experience and a good intention, would qualify any man for the service of\\n', 'his country, except where a course of study is required.  But they\\n', 'thought the want of moral virtues was so far from being supplied by\\n', 'superior endowments of the mind, that employments could never be put into\\n', 'such dangerous hands as those of persons so qualified; and, at least,\\n', 'that the mistakes committed by ignorance, in a virtuous disposition,\\n', 'would never be of such fatal consequence to the public weal, as the\\n', 'practices of a man, whose inclinations led him to be corrupt, and who had\\n', 'great abilities to manage, to multiply, and defend his corruptions.\\n', '\\n', 'In like manner, the disbelief of a Divine Providence renders a man\\n', 'incapable of holding any public station; for, since kings avow themselves\\n', 'to be the deputies of Providence, the Lilliputians think nothing can be\\n', 'more absurd than for a prince to employ such men as disown the authority\\n', 'under which he acts.\\n', '\\n', 'In relating these and the following laws, I would only be understood to\\n', 'mean the original institutions, and not the most scandalous corruptions,\\n', 'into which these people are fallen by the degenerate nature of man.  For,\\n', 'as to that infamous practice of acquiring great employments by dancing on\\n', 'the ropes, or badges of favour and distinction by leaping over sticks and\\n', 'creeping under them, the reader is to observe, that they were first\\n', 'introduced by the grandfather of the emperor now reigning, and grew to\\n', 'the present height by the gradual increase of party and faction.\\n', '\\n', 'Ingratitude is among them a capital crime, as we read it to have been in\\n', 'some other countries: for they reason thus; that whoever makes ill\\n', 'returns to his benefactor, must needs be a common enemy to the rest of\\n', 'mankind, from whom he has received no obligation, and therefore such a\\n', 'man is not fit to live.\\n', '\\n', 'Their notions relating to the duties of parents and children differ\\n', 'extremely from ours.  For, since the conjunction of male and female is\\n', 'founded upon the great law of nature, in order to propagate and continue\\n', 'the species, the Lilliputians will needs have it, that men and women are\\n', 'joined together, like other animals, by the motives of concupiscence; and\\n', 'that their tenderness towards their young proceeds from the like natural\\n', 'principle: for which reason they will never allow that a child is under\\n', 'any obligation to his father for begetting him, or to his mother for\\n', 'bringing him into the world; which, considering the miseries of human\\n', 'life, was neither a benefit in itself, nor intended so by his parents,\\n', 'whose thoughts, in their love encounters, were otherwise employed.  Upon\\n', 'these, and the like reasonings, their opinion is, that parents are the\\n', 'last of all others to be trusted with the education of their own\\n', 'children; and therefore they have in every town public nurseries, where\\n', 'all parents, except cottagers and labourers, are obliged to send their\\n', 'infants of both sexes to be reared and educated, when they come to the\\n', 'age of twenty moons, at which time they are supposed to have some\\n', 'rudiments of docility.  These schools are of several kinds, suited to\\n', 'different qualities, and both sexes.  They have certain professors well\\n', 'skilled in preparing children for such a condition of life as befits the\\n', 'rank of their parents, and their own capacities, as well as inclinations.\\n', 'I shall first say something of the male nurseries, and then of the\\n', 'female.\\n', '\\n', 'The nurseries for males of noble or eminent birth, are provided with\\n', 'grave and learned professors, and their several deputies.  The clothes\\n', 'and food of the children are plain and simple.  They are bred up in the\\n', 'principles of honour, justice, courage, modesty, clemency, religion, and\\n', 'love of their country; they are always employed in some business, except\\n', 'in the times of eating and sleeping, which are very short, and two hours\\n', 'for diversions consisting of bodily exercises.  They are dressed by men\\n', 'till four years of age, and then are obliged to dress themselves,\\n', 'although their quality be ever so great; and the women attendant, who are\\n', 'aged proportionably to ours at fifty, perform only the most menial\\n', 'offices.  They are never suffered to converse with servants, but go\\n', 'together in smaller or greater numbers to take their diversions, and\\n', 'always in the presence of a professor, or one of his deputies; whereby\\n', 'they avoid those early bad impressions of folly and vice, to which our\\n', 'children are subject.  Their parents are suffered to see them only twice\\n', 'a year; the visit is to last but an hour; they are allowed to kiss the\\n', 'child at meeting and parting; but a professor, who always stands by on\\n', 'those occasions, will not suffer them to whisper, or use any fondling\\n', 'expressions, or bring any presents of toys, sweetmeats, and the like.\\n', '\\n', 'The pension from each family for the education and entertainment of a\\n', 'child, upon failure of due payment, is levied by the emperor’s officers.\\n', '\\n', 'The nurseries for children of ordinary gentlemen, merchants, traders, and\\n', 'handicrafts, are managed proportionably after the same manner; only those\\n', 'designed for trades are put out apprentices at eleven years old, whereas\\n', 'those of persons of quality continue in their exercises till fifteen,\\n', 'which answers to twenty-one with us: but the confinement is gradually\\n', 'lessened for the last three years.\\n', '\\n', 'In the female nurseries, the young girls of quality are educated much\\n', 'like the males, only they are dressed by orderly servants of their own\\n', 'sex; but always in the presence of a professor or deputy, till they come\\n', 'to dress themselves, which is at five years old.  And if it be found that\\n', 'these nurses ever presume to entertain the girls with frightful or\\n', 'foolish stories, or the common follies practised by chambermaids among\\n', 'us, they are publicly whipped thrice about the city, imprisoned for a\\n', 'year, and banished for life to the most desolate part of the country.\\n', 'Thus the young ladies are as much ashamed of being cowards and fools as\\n', 'the men, and despise all personal ornaments, beyond decency and\\n', 'cleanliness: neither did I perceive any difference in their education\\n', 'made by their difference of sex, only that the exercises of the females\\n', 'were not altogether so robust; and that some rules were given them\\n', 'relating to domestic life, and a smaller compass of learning was enjoined\\n', 'them: for their maxim is, that among peoples of quality, a wife should be\\n', 'always a reasonable and agreeable companion, because she cannot always be\\n', 'young.  When the girls are twelve years old, which among them is the\\n', 'marriageable age, their parents or guardians take them home, with great\\n', 'expressions of gratitude to the professors, and seldom without tears of\\n', 'the young lady and her companions.\\n', '\\n', 'In the nurseries of females of the meaner sort, the children are\\n', 'instructed in all kinds of works proper for their sex, and their several\\n', 'degrees: those intended for apprentices are dismissed at seven years old,\\n', 'the rest are kept to eleven.\\n', '\\n', 'The meaner families who have children at these nurseries, are obliged,\\n', 'besides their annual pension, which is as low as possible, to return to\\n', 'the steward of the nursery a small monthly share of their gettings, to be\\n', 'a portion for the child; and therefore all parents are limited in their\\n', 'expenses by the law.  For the Lilliputians think nothing can be more\\n', 'unjust, than for people, in subservience to their own appetites, to bring\\n', 'children into the world, and leave the burthen of supporting them on the\\n', 'public.  As to persons of quality, they give security to appropriate a\\n', 'certain sum for each child, suitable to their condition; and these funds\\n', 'are always managed with good husbandry and the most exact justice.\\n', '\\n', 'The cottagers and labourers keep their children at home, their business\\n', 'being only to till and cultivate the earth, and therefore their education\\n', 'is of little consequence to the public: but the old and diseased among\\n', 'them, are supported by hospitals; for begging is a trade unknown in this\\n', 'empire.\\n', '\\n', 'And here it may, perhaps, divert the curious reader, to give some account\\n', 'of my domestics, and my manner of living in this country, during a\\n', 'residence of nine months, and thirteen days.  Having a head mechanically\\n', 'turned, and being likewise forced by necessity, I had made for myself a\\n', 'table and chair convenient enough, out of the largest trees in the royal\\n', 'park.  Two hundred sempstresses were employed to make me shirts, and\\n', 'linen for my bed and table, all of the strongest and coarsest kind they\\n', 'could get; which, however, they were forced to quilt together in several\\n', 'folds, for the thickest was some degrees finer than lawn.  Their linen is\\n', 'usually three inches wide, and three feet make a piece.  The sempstresses\\n', 'took my measure as I lay on the ground, one standing at my neck, and\\n', 'another at my mid-leg, with a strong cord extended, that each held by the\\n', 'end, while a third measured the length of the cord with a rule of an inch\\n', 'long.  Then they measured my right thumb, and desired no more; for by a\\n', 'mathematical computation, that twice round the thumb is once round the\\n', 'wrist, and so on to the neck and the waist, and by the help of my old\\n', 'shirt, which I displayed on the ground before them for a pattern, they\\n', 'fitted me exactly.  Three hundred tailors were employed in the same\\n', 'manner to make me clothes; but they had another contrivance for taking my\\n', 'measure.  I kneeled down, and they raised a ladder from the ground to my\\n', 'neck; upon this ladder one of them mounted, and let fall a plumb-line\\n', 'from my collar to the floor, which just answered the length of my coat:\\n', 'but my waist and arms I measured myself.  When my clothes were finished,\\n', 'which was done in my house (for the largest of theirs would not have been\\n', 'able to hold them), they looked like the patch-work made by the ladies in\\n', 'England, only that mine were all of a colour.\\n', '\\n', 'I had three hundred cooks to dress my victuals, in little convenient huts\\n', 'built about my house, where they and their families lived, and prepared\\n', 'me two dishes a-piece.  I took up twenty waiters in my hand, and placed\\n', 'them on the table: a hundred more attended below on the ground, some with\\n', 'dishes of meat, and some with barrels of wine and other liquors slung on\\n', 'their shoulders; all which the waiters above drew up, as I wanted, in a\\n', 'very ingenious manner, by certain cords, as we draw the bucket up a well\\n', 'in Europe.  A dish of their meat was a good mouthful, and a barrel of\\n', 'their liquor a reasonable draught.  Their mutton yields to ours, but\\n', 'their beef is excellent.  I have had a sirloin so large, that I have been\\n', 'forced to make three bites of it; but this is rare.  My servants were\\n', 'astonished to see me eat it, bones and all, as in our country we do the\\n', 'leg of a lark.  Their geese and turkeys I usually ate at a mouthful, and\\n', 'I confess they far exceed ours.  Of their smaller fowl I could take up\\n', 'twenty or thirty at the end of my knife.\\n', '\\n', 'One day his imperial majesty, being informed of my way of living, desired\\n', '“that himself and his royal consort, with the young princes of the blood\\n', 'of both sexes, might have the happiness,” as he was pleased to call it,\\n', '“of dining with me.”  They came accordingly, and I placed them in chairs\\n', 'of state, upon my table, just over against me, with their guards about\\n', 'them.  Flimnap, the lord high treasurer, attended there likewise with his\\n', 'white staff; and I observed he often looked on me with a sour\\n', 'countenance, which I would not seem to regard, but ate more than usual,\\n', 'in honour to my dear country, as well as to fill the court with\\n', 'admiration.  I have some private reasons to believe, that this visit from\\n', 'his majesty gave Flimnap an opportunity of doing me ill offices to his\\n', 'master.  That minister had always been my secret enemy, though he\\n', 'outwardly caressed me more than was usual to the moroseness of his\\n', 'nature.  He represented to the emperor “the low condition of his\\n', 'treasury; that he was forced to take up money at a great discount; that\\n', 'exchequer bills would not circulate under nine per cent. below par; that\\n', 'I had cost his majesty above a million and a half of _sprugs_” (their\\n', 'greatest gold coin, about the bigness of a spangle) “and, upon the whole,\\n', 'that it would be advisable in the emperor to take the first fair occasion\\n', 'of dismissing me.”\\n', '\\n', 'I am here obliged to vindicate the reputation of an excellent lady, who\\n', 'was an innocent sufferer upon my account.  The treasurer took a fancy to\\n', 'be jealous of his wife, from the malice of some evil tongues, who\\n', 'informed him that her grace had taken a violent affection for my person;\\n', 'and the court scandal ran for some time, that she once came privately to\\n', 'my lodging.  This I solemnly declare to be a most infamous falsehood,\\n', 'without any grounds, further than that her grace was pleased to treat me\\n', 'with all innocent marks of freedom and friendship.  I own she came often\\n', 'to my house, but always publicly, nor ever without three more in the\\n', 'coach, who were usually her sister and young daughter, and some\\n', 'particular acquaintance; but this was common to many other ladies of the\\n', 'court.  And I still appeal to my servants round, whether they at any time\\n', 'saw a coach at my door, without knowing what persons were in it.  On\\n', 'those occasions, when a servant had given me notice, my custom was to go\\n', 'immediately to the door, and, after paying my respects, to take up the\\n', 'coach and two horses very carefully in my hands (for, if there were six\\n', 'horses, the postillion always unharnessed four,) and place them on a\\n', 'table, where I had fixed a movable rim quite round, of five inches high,\\n', 'to prevent accidents.  And I have often had four coaches and horses at\\n', 'once on my table, full of company, while I sat in my chair, leaning my\\n', 'face towards them; and when I was engaged with one set, the coachmen\\n', 'would gently drive the others round my table.  I have passed many an\\n', 'afternoon very agreeably in these conversations.  But I defy the\\n', 'treasurer, or his two informers (I will name them, and let them make the\\n', 'best of it) Clustril and Drunlo, to prove that any person ever came to me\\n', '_incognito_, except the secretary Reldresal, who was sent by express\\n', 'command of his imperial majesty, as I have before related.  I should not\\n', 'have dwelt so long upon this particular, if it had not been a point\\n', 'wherein the reputation of a great lady is so nearly concerned, to say\\n', 'nothing of my own; though I then had the honour to be a _nardac_, which\\n', 'the treasurer himself is not; for all the world knows, that he is only a\\n', '_glumglum_, a title inferior by one degree, as that of a marquis is to a\\n', 'duke in England; yet I allow he preceded me in right of his post.  These\\n', 'false informations, which I afterwards came to the knowledge of by an\\n', 'accident not proper to mention, made the treasurer show his lady for some\\n', 'time an ill countenance, and me a worse; and although he was at last\\n', 'undeceived and reconciled to her, yet I lost all credit with him, and\\n', 'found my interest decline very fast with the emperor himself, who was,\\n', 'indeed, too much governed by that favourite.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER VII.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The author, being informed of a design to accuse him of high-treason,\\n', 'makes his escape to Blefuscu.  His reception there.\\n', '\\n', 'Before I proceed to give an account of my leaving this kingdom, it may be\\n', 'proper to inform the reader of a private intrigue which had been for two\\n', 'months forming against me.\\n', '\\n', 'I had been hitherto, all my life, a stranger to courts, for which I was\\n', 'unqualified by the meanness of my condition.

The chairmen\\n', 'were dismissed; I put the chair, with his lordship in it, into my\\n', 'coat-pocket: and, giving orders to a trusty servant, to say I was\\n', 'indisposed and gone to sleep, I fastened the door of my house, placed the\\n', 'chair on the table, according to my usual custom, and sat down by it.\\n', 'After the common salutations were over, observing his lordship’s\\n', 'countenance full of concern, and inquiring into the reason, he desired “I\\n', 'would hear him with patience, in a matter that highly concerned my honour\\n', 'and my life.”  His speech was to the following effect, for I took notes\\n', 'of it as soon as he left me:—\\n', '\\n', '“You are to know,” said he, “that several committees of council have been\\n', 'lately called, in the most private manner, on your account; and it is but\\n', 'two days since his majesty came to a full resolution.\\n', '\\n', '“You are very sensible that Skyresh Bolgolam” (_galbet_, or high-admiral)\\n', '“has been your mortal enemy, almost ever since your arrival.

This\\n', 'speech was immediately published throughout the kingdom; nor did any\\n', 'thing terrify the people so much as those encomiums on his majesty’s\\n', 'mercy; because it was observed, that the more these praises were enlarged\\n', 'and insisted on, the more inhuman was the punishment, and the sufferer\\n', 'more innocent.  Yet, as to myself, I must confess, having never been\\n', 'designed for a courtier, either by my birth or education, I was so ill a\\n', 'judge of things, that I could not discover the lenity and favour of this\\n', 'sentence, but conceived it (perhaps erroneously) rather to be rigorous\\n', 'than gentle.  I sometimes thought of standing my trial, for, although I\\n', 'could not deny the facts alleged in the several articles, yet I hoped\\n', 'they would admit of some extenuation.  But having in my life perused many\\n', 'state-trials, which I ever observed to terminate as the judges thought\\n', 'fit to direct, I durst not rely on so dangerous a decision, in so\\n', 'critical a juncture, and against such powerful enemies.  Once I was\\n', 'strongly bent upon resistance, for, while I had liberty the whole\\n', 'strength of that empire could hardly subdue me, and I might easily with\\n', 'stones pelt the metropolis to pieces; but I soon rejected that project\\n', 'with horror, by remembering the oath I had made to the emperor, the\\n', 'favours I received from him, and the high title of _nardac_ he conferred\\n', 'upon me.  Neither had I so soon learned the gratitude of courtiers, to\\n', 'persuade myself, that his majesty’s present seventies acquitted me of all\\n', 'past obligations.\\n', '\\n', 'At last, I fixed upon a resolution, for which it is probable I may incur\\n', 'some censure, and not unjustly; for I confess I owe the preserving of\\n', 'mine eyes, and consequently my liberty, to my own great rashness and want\\n', 'of experience; because, if I had then known the nature of princes and\\n', 'ministers, which I have since observed in many other courts, and their\\n', 'methods of treating criminals less obnoxious than myself, I should, with\\n', 'great alacrity and readiness, have submitted to so easy a punishment.\\n', 'But hurried on by the precipitancy of youth, and having his imperial\\n', 'majesty’s license to pay my attendance upon the emperor of Blefuscu, I\\n', 'took this opportunity, before the three days were elapsed, to send a\\n', 'letter to my friend the secretary, signifying my resolution of setting\\n', 'out that morning for Blefuscu, pursuant to the leave I had got; and,\\n', 'without waiting for an answer, I went to that side of the island where\\n', 'our fleet lay.  I seized a large man of war, tied a cable to the prow,\\n', 'and, lifting up the anchors, I stripped myself, put my clothes (together\\n', 'with my coverlet, which I carried under my arm) into the vessel, and,\\n', 'drawing it after me, between wading and swimming arrived at the royal\\n', 'port of Blefuscu, where the people had long expected me: they lent me two\\n', 'guides to direct me to the capital city, which is of the same name.  I\\n', 'held them in my hands, till I came within two hundred yards of the gate,\\n', 'and desired them “to signify my arrival to one of the secretaries, and\\n', 'let him know, I there waited his majesty’s command.”  I had an answer in\\n', 'about an hour, “that his majesty, attended by the royal family, and great\\n', 'officers of the court, was coming out to receive me.”  I advanced a\\n', 'hundred yards.  The emperor and his train alighted from their horses, the\\n', 'empress and ladies from their coaches, and I did not perceive they were\\n', 'in any fright or concern.  I lay on the ground to kiss his majesty’s and\\n', 'the empress’s hands.  I told his majesty, “that I was come according to\\n', 'my promise, and with the license of the emperor my master, to have the\\n', 'honour of seeing so mighty a monarch, and to offer him any service in my\\n', 'power, consistent with my duty to my own prince;” not mentioning a word\\n', 'of my disgrace, because I had hitherto no regular information of it, and\\n', 'might suppose myself wholly ignorant of any such design; neither could I\\n', 'reasonably conceive that the emperor would discover the secret, while I\\n', 'was out of his power; wherein, however, it soon appeared I was deceived.\\n', '\\n', 'I shall not trouble the reader with the particular account of my\\n', 'reception at this court, which was suitable to the generosity of so great\\n', 'a prince; nor of the difficulties I was in for want of a house and bed,\\n', 'being forced to lie on the ground, wrapped up in my coverlet.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER VIII.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The author, by a lucky accident, finds means to leave Blefuscu; and,\\n', 'after some difficulties, returns safe to his native country.\\n', '\\n', 'Three days after my arrival, walking out of curiosity to the north-east\\n', 'coast of the island, I observed, about half a league off in the sea,\\n', 'somewhat that looked like a boat overturned.  I pulled off my shoes and\\n', 'stockings, and, wailing two or three hundred yards, I found the object to\\n', 'approach nearer by force of the tide; and then plainly saw it to be a\\n', 'real boat, which I supposed might by some tempest have been driven from a\\n', 'ship.  Whereupon, I returned immediately towards the city, and desired\\n', 'his imperial majesty to lend me twenty of the tallest vessels he had\\n', 'left, after the loss of his fleet, and three thousand seamen, under the\\n', 'command of his vice-admiral.  This fleet sailed round, while I went back\\n', 'the shortest way to the coast, where I first discovered the boat.  I\\n', 'found the tide had driven it still nearer.  The seamen were all provided\\n', 'with cordage, which I had beforehand twisted to a sufficient strength.\\n', 'When the ships came up, I stripped myself, and waded till I came within a\\n', 'hundred yards off the boat, after which I was forced to swim till I got\\n', 'up to it.  The seamen threw me the end of the cord, which I fastened to a\\n', 'hole in the fore-part of the boat, and the other end to a man of war; but\\n', 'I found all my labour to little purpose; for, being out of my depth, I\\n', 'was not able to work.  In this necessity I was forced to swim behind, and\\n', 'push the boat forward, as often as I could, with one of my hands; and the\\n', 'tide favouring me, I advanced so far that I could just hold up my chin\\n', 'and feel the ground.  I rested two or three minutes, and then gave the\\n', 'boat another shove, and so on, till the sea was no higher than my\\n', 'arm-pits; and now, the most laborious part being over, I took out my\\n', 'other cables, which were stowed in one of the ships, and fastened them\\n', 'first to the boat, and then to nine of the vessels which attended me; the\\n', 'wind being favourable, the seamen towed, and I shoved, until we arrived\\n', 'within forty yards of the shore; and, waiting till the tide was out, I\\n', 'got dry to the boat, and by the assistance of two thousand men, with\\n', 'ropes and engines, I made a shift to turn it on its bottom, and found it\\n', 'was but little damaged.\\n', '\\n', 'I shall not trouble the reader with the difficulties I was under, by the\\n', 'help of certain paddles, which cost me ten days making, to get my boat to\\n', 'the royal port of Blefuscu, where a mighty concourse of people appeared\\n', 'upon my arrival, full of wonder at the sight of so prodigious a vessel.\\n', 'I told the emperor “that my good fortune had thrown this boat in my way,\\n', 'to carry me to some place whence I might return into my native country;\\n', 'and begged his majesty’s orders for getting materials to fit it up,\\n', 'together with his license to depart;” which, after some kind\\n', 'expostulations, he was pleased to grant.\\n', '\\n', 'I did very much wonder, in all this time, not to have heard of any\\n', 'express relating to me from our emperor to the court of Blefuscu.  But I\\n', 'was afterward given privately to understand, that his imperial majesty,\\n', 'never imagining I had the least notice of his designs, believed I was\\n', 'only gone to Blefuscu in performance of my promise, according to the\\n', 'license he had given me, which was well known at our court, and would\\n', 'return in a few days, when the ceremony was ended.  But he was at last in\\n', 'pain at my long absence; and after consulting with the treasurer and the\\n', 'rest of that cabal, a person of quality was dispatched with the copy of\\n', 'the articles against me.  This envoy had instructions to represent to the\\n', 'monarch of Blefuscu, “the great lenity of his master, who was content to\\n', 'punish me no farther than with the loss of mine eyes; that I had fled\\n', 'from justice; and if I did not return in two hours, I should be deprived\\n', 'of my title of _nardac_, and declared a traitor.”  The envoy further\\n', 'added, “that in order to maintain the peace and amity between both\\n', 'empires, his master expected that his brother of Blefuscu would give\\n', 'orders to have me sent back to Lilliput, bound hand and foot, to be\\n', 'punished as a traitor.”\\n', '\\n', 'The emperor of Blefuscu, having taken three days to consult, returned an\\n', 'answer consisting of many civilities and excuses.  He said, “that as for\\n', 'sending me bound, his brother knew it was impossible; that, although I\\n', 'had deprived him of his fleet, yet he owed great obligations to me for\\n', 'many good offices I had done him in making the peace.  That, however,\\n', 'both their majesties would soon be made easy; for I had found a\\n', 'prodigious vessel on the shore, able to carry me on the sea, which he had\\n', 'given orders to fit up, with my own assistance and direction; and he\\n', 'hoped, in a few weeks, both empires would be freed from so insupportable\\n', 'an encumbrance.”\\n', '\\n', 'With this answer the envoy returned to Lilliput; and the monarch of\\n', 'Blefuscu related to me all that had passed; offering me at the same time\\n', '(but under the strictest confidence) his gracious protection, if I would\\n', 'continue in his service; wherein, although I believed him sincere, yet I\\n', 'resolved never more to put any confidence in princes or ministers, where\\n', 'I could possibly avoid it; and therefore, with all due acknowledgments\\n', 'for his favourable intentions, I humbly begged to be excused.  I told\\n', 'him, “that since fortune, whether good or evil, had thrown a vessel in my\\n', 'way, I was resolved to venture myself on the ocean, rather than be an\\n', 'occasion of difference between two such mighty monarchs.”  Neither did I\\n', 'find the emperor at all displeased; and I discovered, by a certain\\n', 'accident, that he was very glad of my resolution, and so were most of his\\n', 'ministers.\\n', '\\n', 'These considerations moved me to hasten my departure somewhat sooner than\\n', 'I intended; to which the court, impatient to have me gone, very readily\\n', 'contributed.  Five hundred workmen were employed to make two sails to my\\n', 'boat, according to my directions, by quilting thirteen folds of their\\n', 'strongest linen together.  I was at the pains of making ropes and cables,\\n', 'by twisting ten, twenty, or thirty of the thickest and strongest of\\n', 'theirs.  A great stone that I happened to find, after a long search, by\\n', 'the sea-shore, served me for an anchor.  I had the tallow of three\\n', 'hundred cows, for greasing my boat, and other uses.  I was at incredible\\n', 'pains in cutting down some of the largest timber-trees, for oars and\\n', 'masts, wherein I was, however, much assisted by his majesty’s\\n', 'ship-carpenters, who helped me in smoothing them, after I had done the\\n', 'rough work.\\n', '\\n', 'In about a month, when all was prepared, I sent to receive his majesty’s\\n', 'commands, and to take my leave.  The emperor and royal family came out of\\n', 'the palace; I lay down on my face to kiss his hand, which he very\\n', 'graciously gave me: so did the empress and young princes of the blood.\\n', 'His majesty presented me with fifty purses of two hundred _sprugs_\\n', 'a-piece, together with his picture at full length, which I put\\n', 'immediately into one of my gloves, to keep it from being hurt.  The\\n', 'ceremonies at my departure were too many to trouble the reader with at\\n', 'this time.\\n', '\\n', 'I stored the boat with the carcases of a hundred oxen, and three hundred\\n', 'sheep, with bread and drink proportionable, and as much meat ready\\n', 'dressed as four hundred cooks could provide.  I took with me six cows and\\n', 'two bulls alive, with as many ewes and rams, intending to carry them into\\n', 'my own country, and propagate the breed.  And to feed them on board, I\\n', 'had a good bundle of hay, and a bag of corn.  I would gladly have taken a\\n', 'dozen of the natives, but this was a thing the emperor would by no means\\n', 'permit; and, besides a diligent search into my pockets, his majesty\\n', 'engaged my honour “not to carry away any of his subjects, although with\\n', 'their own consent and desire.”\\n', '\\n', 'Having thus prepared all things as well as I was able, I set sail on the\\n', 'twenty-fourth day of September 1701, at six in the morning; and when I\\n', 'had gone about four-leagues to the northward, the wind being at\\n', 'south-east, at six in the evening I descried a small island, about half a\\n', 'league to the north-west.  I advanced forward, and cast anchor on the\\n', 'lee-side of the island, which seemed to be uninhabited.  I then took some\\n', 'refreshment, and went to my rest.  I slept well, and as I conjectured at\\n', 'least six hours, for I found the day broke in two hours after I awaked.\\n', 'It was a clear night.  I ate my breakfast before the sun was up; and\\n', 'heaving anchor, the wind being favourable, I steered the same course that\\n', 'I had done the day before, wherein I was directed by my pocket compass.\\n', 'My intention was to reach, if possible, one of those islands which I had\\n', 'reason to believe lay to the north-east of Van Diemen’s Land.  I\\n', 'discovered nothing all that day; but upon the next, about three in the\\n', 'afternoon, when I had by my computation made twenty-four leagues from\\n', 'Blefuscu, I descried a sail steering to the south-east; my course was due\\n', 'east.  I hailed her, but could get no answer; yet I found I gained upon\\n', 'her, for the wind slackened.  I made all the sail I could, and in half an\\n', 'hour she spied me, then hung out her ancient, and discharged a gun.  It\\n', 'is not easy to express the joy I was in, upon the unexpected hope of once\\n', 'more seeing my beloved country, and the dear pledges I left in it.  The\\n', 'ship slackened her sails, and I came up with her between five and six in\\n', 'the evening, September 26th; but my heart leaped within me to see her\\n', 'English colours.  I put my cows and sheep into my coat-pockets, and got\\n', 'on board with all my little cargo of provisions.  The vessel was an\\n', 'English merchantman, returning from Japan by the North and South seas;\\n', 'the captain, Mr. John Biddel, of Deptford, a very civil man, and an\\n', 'excellent sailor.\\n', '\\n', 'We were now in the latitude of 30 degrees south; there were about fifty\\n', 'men in the ship; and here I met an old comrade of mine, one Peter\\n', 'Williams, who gave me a good character to the captain.  This gentleman\\n', 'treated me with kindness, and desired I would let him know what place I\\n', 'came from last, and whither I was bound; which I did in a few words, but\\n', 'he thought I was raving, and that the dangers I underwent had disturbed\\n', 'my head; whereupon I took my black cattle and sheep out of my pocket,\\n', 'which, after great astonishment, clearly convinced him of my veracity.  I\\n', 'then showed him the gold given me by the emperor of Blefuscu, together\\n', 'with his majesty’s picture at full length, and some other rarities of\\n', 'that country.  I gave him two purses of two hundreds _sprugs_ each, and\\n', 'promised, when we arrived in England, to make him a present of a cow and\\n', 'a sheep big with young.\\n', '\\n', 'I shall not trouble the reader with a particular account of this voyage,\\n', 'which was very prosperous for the most part.  We arrived in the Downs on\\n', 'the 13th of April, 1702.  I had only one misfortune, that the rats on\\n', 'board carried away one of my sheep; I found her bones in a hole, picked\\n', 'clean from the flesh.  The rest of my cattle I got safe ashore, and set\\n', 'them a-grazing in a bowling-green at Greenwich, where the fineness of the\\n', 'grass made them feed very heartily, though I had always feared the\\n', 'contrary: neither could I possibly have preserved them in so long a\\n', 'voyage, if the captain had not allowed me some of his best biscuit,\\n', 'which, rubbed to powder, and mingled with water, was their constant food.\\n', 'The short time I continued in England, I made a considerable profit by\\n', 'showing my cattle to many persons of quality and others: and before I\\n', 'began my second voyage, I sold them for six hundred pounds.  Since my\\n', 'last return I find the breed is considerably increased, especially the\\n', 'sheep, which I hope will prove much to the advantage of the woollen\\n', 'manufacture, by the fineness of the fleeces.\\n', '\\n', 'I stayed but two months with my wife and family, for my insatiable desire\\n', 'of seeing foreign countries, would suffer me to continue no longer.  I\\n', 'left fifteen hundred pounds with my wife, and fixed her in a good house\\n', 'at Redriff.  My remaining stock I carried with me, part in money and part\\n', 'in goods, in hopes to improve my fortunes.  My eldest uncle John had left\\n', 'me an estate in land, near Epping, of about thirty pounds a-year; and I\\n', 'had a long lease of the Black Bull in Fetter-Lane, which yielded me as\\n', 'much more; so that I was not in any danger of leaving my family upon the\\n', 'parish.  My son Johnny, named so after his uncle, was at the\\n', 'grammar-school, and a towardly child.  My daughter Betty (who is now well\\n', 'married, and has children) was then at her needle-work.  I took leave of\\n', 'my wife, and boy and girl, with tears on both sides, and went on board\\n', 'the Adventure, a merchant ship of three hundred tons, bound for Surat,\\n', 'captain John Nicholas, of Liverpool, commander.  But my account of this\\n', 'voyage must be referred to the Second Part of my Travels.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'PART II.

A description of the inhabitants.\\n', '\\n', 'Having been condemned, by nature and fortune, to active and restless\\n', 'life, in two months after my return, I again left my native country, and\\n', 'took shipping in the Downs, on the 20th day of June, 1702, in the\\n', 'Adventure, Captain John Nicholas, a Cornish man, commander, bound for\\n', 'Surat.  We had a very prosperous gale, till we arrived at the Cape of\\n', 'Good Hope, where we landed for fresh water; but discovering a leak, we\\n', 'unshipped our goods and wintered there; for the captain falling sick of\\n', 'an ague, we could not leave the Cape till the end of March.  We then set\\n', 'sail, and had a good voyage till we passed the Straits of Madagascar; but\\n', 'having got northward of that island, and to about five degrees south\\n', 'latitude, the winds, which in those seas are observed to blow a constant\\n', 'equal gale between the north and west, from the beginning of December to\\n', 'the beginning of May, on the 19th of April began to blow with much\\n', 'greater violence, and more westerly than usual, continuing so for twenty\\n', 'days together: during which time, we were driven a little to the east of\\n', 'the Molucca Islands, and about three degrees northward of the line, as\\n', 'our captain found by an observation he took the 2nd of May, at which time\\n', 'the wind ceased, and it was a perfect calm, whereat I was not a little\\n', 'rejoiced.  But he, being a man well experienced in the navigation of\\n', 'those seas, bid us all prepare against a storm, which accordingly\\n', 'happened the day following: for the southern wind, called the southern\\n', 'monsoon, began to set in.\\n', '\\n', 'Finding it was likely to overblow, we took in our sprit-sail, and stood\\n', 'by to hand the fore-sail; but making foul weather, we looked the guns\\n', 'were all fast, and handed the mizen.  The ship lay very broad off, so we\\n', 'thought it better spooning before the sea, than trying or hulling.  We\\n', 'reefed the fore-sail and set him, and hauled aft the fore-sheet; the helm\\n', 'was hard a-weather.  The ship wore bravely.  We belayed the fore\\n', 'down-haul; but the sail was split, and we hauled down the yard, and got\\n', 'the sail into the ship, and unbound all the things clear of it.  It was a\\n', 'very fierce storm; the sea broke strange and dangerous.  We hauled off\\n', 'upon the laniard of the whip-staff, and helped the man at the helm.  We\\n', 'would not get down our topmast, but let all stand, because she scudded\\n', 'before the sea very well, and we knew that the top-mast being aloft, the\\n', 'ship was the wholesomer, and made better way through the sea, seeing we\\n', 'had sea-room.  When the storm was over, we set fore-sail and main-sail,\\n', 'and brought the ship to.  Then we set the mizen, main-top-sail, and the\\n', 'fore-top-sail.  Our course was east-north-east, the wind was at\\n', 'south-west.  We got the starboard tacks aboard, we cast off our\\n', 'weather-braces and lifts; we set in the lee-braces, and hauled forward by\\n', 'the weather-bowlings, and hauled them tight, and belayed them, and hauled\\n', 'over the mizen tack to windward, and kept her full and by as near as she\\n', 'would lie.\\n', '\\n', 'During this storm, which was followed by a strong wind west-south-west,\\n', 'we were carried, by my computation, about five hundred leagues to the\\n', 'east, so that the oldest sailor on board could not tell in what part of\\n', 'the world we were.  Our provisions held out well, our ship was staunch,\\n', 'and our crew all in good health; but we lay in the utmost distress for\\n', 'water.  We thought it best to hold on the same course, rather than turn\\n', 'more northerly, which might have brought us to the north-west part of\\n', 'Great Tartary, and into the Frozen Sea.\\n', '\\n', 'On the 16th day of June, 1703, a boy on the top-mast discovered land.  On\\n', 'the 17th, we came in full view of a great island, or continent (for we\\n', 'knew not whether;) on the south side whereof was a small neck of land\\n', 'jutting out into the sea, and a creek too shallow to hold a ship of above\\n', 'one hundred tons.  We cast anchor within a league of this creek, and our\\n', 'captain sent a dozen of his men well armed in the long-boat, with vessels\\n', 'for water, if any could be found.  I desired his leave to go with them,\\n', 'that I might see the country, and make what discoveries I could.  When we\\n', 'came to land we saw no river or spring, nor any sign of inhabitants.  Our\\n', 'men therefore wandered on the shore to find out some fresh water near the\\n', 'sea, and I walked alone about a mile on the other side, where I observed\\n', 'the country all barren and rocky.  I now began to be weary, and seeing\\n', 'nothing to entertain my curiosity, I returned gently down towards the\\n', 'creek; and the sea being full in my view, I saw our men already got into\\n', 'the boat, and rowing for life to the ship.  I was going to holla after\\n', 'them, although it had been to little purpose, when I observed a huge\\n', 'creature walking after them in the sea, as fast as he could: he waded not\\n', 'much deeper than his knees, and took prodigious strides: but our men had\\n', 'the start of him half a league, and, the sea thereabouts being full of\\n', 'sharp-pointed rocks, the monster was not able to overtake the boat.  This\\n', 'I was afterwards told, for I durst not stay to see the issue of the\\n', 'adventure; but ran as fast as I could the way I first went, and then\\n', 'climbed up a steep hill, which gave me some prospect of the country.  I\\n', 'found it fully cultivated; but that which first surprised me was the\\n', 'length of the grass, which, in those grounds that seemed to be kept for\\n', 'hay, was about twenty feet high.\\n', '\\n', 'I fell into a high road, for so I took it to be, though it served to the\\n', 'inhabitants only as a foot-path through a field of barley.  Here I walked\\n', 'on for some time, but could see little on either side, it being now near\\n', 'harvest, and the corn rising at least forty feet.  I was an hour walking\\n', 'to the end of this field, which was fenced in with a hedge of at least\\n', 'one hundred and twenty feet high, and the trees so lofty that I could\\n', 'make no computation of their altitude.  There was a stile to pass from\\n', 'this field into the next.  It had four steps, and a stone to cross over\\n', 'when you came to the uppermost.  It was impossible for me to climb this\\n', 'stile, because every step was six-feet high, and the upper stone about\\n', 'twenty.  I was endeavouring to find some gap in the hedge, when I\\n', 'discovered one of the inhabitants in the next field, advancing towards\\n', 'the stile, of the same size with him whom I saw in the sea pursuing our\\n', 'boat.  He appeared as tall as an ordinary spire steeple, and took about\\n', 'ten yards at every stride, as near as I could guess.  I was struck with\\n', 'the utmost fear and astonishment, and ran to hide myself in the corn,\\n', 'whence I saw him at the top of the stile looking back into the next field\\n', 'on the right hand, and heard him call in a voice many degrees louder than\\n', 'a speaking-trumpet: but the noise was so high in the air, that at first I\\n', 'certainly thought it was thunder.  Whereupon seven monsters, like\\n', 'himself, came towards him with reaping-hooks in their hands, each hook\\n', 'about the largeness of six scythes.  These people were not so well clad\\n', 'as the first, whose servants or labourers they seemed to be; for, upon\\n', 'some words he spoke, they went to reap the corn in the field where I lay.\\n', 'I kept from them at as great a distance as I could, but was forced to\\n', 'move with extreme difficulty, for the stalks of the corn were sometimes\\n', 'not above a foot distant, so that I could hardly squeeze my body betwixt\\n', 'them.  However, I made a shift to go forward, till I came to a part of\\n', 'the field where the corn had been laid by the rain and wind.  Here it was\\n', 'impossible for me to advance a step; for the stalks were so interwoven,\\n', 'that I could not creep through, and the beards of the fallen ears so\\n', 'strong and pointed, that they pierced through my clothes into my flesh.\\n', 'At the same time I heard the reapers not a hundred yards behind me.\\n', 'Being quite dispirited with toil, and wholly overcome by grief and\\n', 'dispair, I lay down between two ridges, and heartily wished I might there\\n', 'end my days.  I bemoaned my desolate widow and fatherless children.  I\\n', 'lamented my own folly and wilfulness, in attempting a second voyage,\\n', 'against the advice of all my friends and relations.  In this terrible\\n', 'agitation of mind, I could not forbear thinking of Lilliput, whose\\n', 'inhabitants looked upon me as the greatest prodigy that ever appeared in\\n', 'the world; where I was able to draw an imperial fleet in my hand, and\\n', 'perform those other actions, which will be recorded for ever in the\\n', 'chronicles of that empire, while posterity shall hardly believe them,\\n', 'although attested by millions.  I reflected what a mortification it must\\n', 'prove to me, to appear as inconsiderable in this nation, as one single\\n', 'Lilliputian would be among us.  But this I conceived was to be the least\\n', 'of my misfortunes; for, as human creatures are observed to be more savage\\n', 'and cruel in proportion to their bulk, what could I expect but to be a\\n', 'morsel in the mouth of the first among these enormous barbarians that\\n', 'should happen to seize me?  Undoubtedly philosophers are in the right,\\n', 'when they tell us that nothing is great or little otherwise than by\\n', 'comparison.  It might have pleased fortune, to have let the Lilliputians\\n', 'find some nation, where the people were as diminutive with respect to\\n', 'them, as they were to me.  And who knows but that even this prodigious\\n', 'race of mortals might be equally overmatched in some distant part of the\\n', 'world, whereof we have yet no discovery.\\n', '\\n', 'Scared and confounded as I was, I could not forbear going on with these\\n', 'reflections, when one of the reapers, approaching within ten yards of the\\n', 'ridge where I lay, made me apprehend that with the next step I should be\\n', 'squashed to death under his foot, or cut in two with his reaping-hook.\\n', 'And therefore, when he was again about to move, I screamed as loud as\\n', 'fear could make me: whereupon the huge creature trod short, and, looking\\n', 'round about under him for some time, at last espied me as I lay on the\\n', 'ground.  He considered awhile, with the caution of one who endeavours to\\n', 'lay hold on a small dangerous animal in such a manner that it shall not\\n', 'be able either to scratch or bite him, as I myself have sometimes done\\n', 'with a weasel in England.  At length he ventured to take me behind, by\\n', 'the middle, between his fore-finger and thumb, and brought me within\\n', 'three yards of his eyes, that he might behold my shape more perfectly.  I\\n', 'guessed his meaning, and my good fortune gave me so much presence of\\n', 'mind, that I resolved not to struggle in the least as he held me in the\\n', 'air above sixty feet from the ground, although he grievously pinched my\\n', 'sides, for fear I should slip through his fingers.  All I ventured was to\\n', 'raise mine eyes towards the sun, and place my hands together in a\\n', 'supplicating posture, and to speak some words in a humble melancholy\\n', 'tone, suitable to the condition I then was in: for I apprehended every\\n', 'moment that he would dash me against the ground, as we usually do any\\n', 'little hateful animal, which we have a mind to destroy.  But my good star\\n', 'would have it, that he appeared pleased with my voice and gestures, and\\n', 'began to look upon me as a curiosity, much wondering to hear me pronounce\\n', 'articulate words, although he could not understand them.  In the mean\\n', 'time I was not able to forbear groaning and shedding tears, and turning\\n', 'my head towards my sides; letting him know, as well as I could, how\\n', 'cruelly I was hurt by the pressure of his thumb and finger.  He seemed to\\n', 'apprehend my meaning; for, lifting up the lappet of his coat, he put me\\n', 'gently into it, and immediately ran along with me to his master, who was\\n', 'a substantial farmer, and the same person I had first seen in the field.\\n', '\\n', 'The farmer having (as I suppose by their talk) received such an account\\n', 'of me as his servant could give him, took a piece of a small straw, about\\n', 'the size of a walking-staff, and therewith lifted up the lappets of my\\n', 'coat; which it seems he thought to be some kind of covering that nature\\n', 'had given me.  He blew my hairs aside to take a better view of my face.\\n', 'He called his hinds about him, and asked them, as I afterwards learned,\\n', 'whether they had ever seen in the fields any little creature that\\n', 'resembled me.  He then placed me softly on the ground upon all fours, but\\n', 'I got immediately up, and walked slowly backward and forward, to let\\n', 'those people see I had no intent to run away.  They all sat down in a\\n', 'circle about me, the better to observe my motions.  I pulled off my hat,\\n', 'and made a low bow towards the farmer.  I fell on my knees, and lifted up\\n', 'my hands and eyes, and spoke several words as loud as I could: I took a\\n', 'purse of gold out of my pocket, and humbly presented it to him.  He\\n', 'received it on the palm of his hand, then applied it close to his eye to\\n', 'see what it was, and afterwards turned it several times with the point of\\n', 'a pin (which he took out of his sleeve,) but could make nothing of it.\\n', 'Whereupon I made a sign that he should place his hand on the ground.  I\\n', 'then took the purse, and, opening it, poured all the gold into his palm.\\n', 'There were six Spanish pieces of four pistoles each, beside twenty or\\n', 'thirty smaller coins.  I saw him wet the tip of his little finger upon\\n', 'his tongue, and take up one of my largest pieces, and then another; but\\n', 'he seemed to be wholly ignorant what they were.  He made me a sign to put\\n', 'them again into my purse, and the purse again into my pocket, which,\\n', 'after offering it to him several times, I thought it best to do.\\n', '\\n', 'The farmer, by this time, was convinced I must be a rational creature.\\n', 'He spoke often to me; but the sound of his voice pierced my ears like\\n', 'that of a water-mill, yet his words were articulate enough.  I answered\\n', 'as loud as I could in several languages, and he often laid his ear within\\n', 'two yards of me: but all in vain, for we were wholly unintelligible to\\n', 'each other.  He then sent his servants to their work, and taking his\\n', 'handkerchief out of his pocket, he doubled and spread it on his left\\n', 'hand, which he placed flat on the ground with the palm upward, making me\\n', 'a sign to step into it, as I could easily do, for it was not above a foot\\n', 'in thickness.  I thought it my part to obey, and, for fear of falling,\\n', 'laid myself at full length upon the handkerchief, with the remainder of\\n', 'which he lapped me up to the head for further security, and in this\\n', 'manner carried me home to his house.  There he called his wife, and\\n', 'showed me to her; but she screamed and ran back, as women in England do\\n', 'at the sight of a toad or a spider.  However, when she had a while seen\\n', 'my behaviour, and how well I observed the signs her husband made, she was\\n', 'soon reconciled, and by degrees grew extremely tender of me.\\n', '\\n', 'It was about twelve at noon, and a servant brought in dinner.  It was\\n', 'only one substantial dish of meat (fit for the plain condition of a\\n', 'husbandman,) in a dish of about four-and-twenty feet diameter.  The\\n', 'company were, the farmer and his wife, three children, and an old\\n', 'grandmother.  When they were sat down, the farmer placed me at some\\n', 'distance from him on the table, which was thirty feet high from the\\n', 'floor.  I was in a terrible fright, and kept as far as I could from the\\n', 'edge, for fear of falling.  The wife minced a bit of meat, then crumbled\\n', 'some bread on a trencher, and placed it before me.  I made her a low bow,\\n', 'took out my knife and fork, and fell to eat, which gave them exceeding\\n', 'delight.  The mistress sent her maid for a small dram cup, which held\\n', 'about two gallons, and filled it with drink; I took up the vessel with\\n', 'much difficulty in both hands, and in a most respectful manner drank to\\n', 'her ladyship’s health, expressing the words as loud as I could in\\n', 'English, which made the company laugh so heartily, that I was almost\\n', 'deafened with the noise.  This liquor tasted like a small cider, and was\\n', 'not unpleasant.  Then the master made me a sign to come to his trencher\\n', 'side; but as I walked on the table, being in great surprise all the time,\\n', 'as the indulgent reader will easily conceive and excuse, I happened to\\n', 'stumble against a crust, and fell flat on my face, but received no hurt.\\n', 'I got up immediately, and observing the good people to be in much\\n', 'concern, I took my hat (which I held under my arm out of good manners,)\\n', 'and waving it over my head, made three huzzas, to show I had got no\\n', 'mischief by my fall.  But advancing forward towards my master (as I shall\\n', 'henceforth call him,) his youngest son, who sat next to him, an arch boy\\n', 'of about ten years old, took me up by the legs, and held me so high in\\n', 'the air, that I trembled every limb: but his father snatched me from him,\\n', 'and at the same time gave him such a box on the left ear, as would have\\n', 'felled an European troop of horse to the earth, ordering him to be taken\\n', 'from the table.  But being afraid the boy might owe me a spite, and well\\n', 'remembering how mischievous all children among us naturally are to\\n', 'sparrows, rabbits, young kittens, and puppy dogs, I fell on my knees, and\\n', 'pointing to the boy, made my master to understand, as well as I could,\\n', 'that I desired his son might be pardoned.  The father complied, and the\\n', 'lad took his seat again, whereupon I went to him, and kissed his hand,\\n', 'which my master took, and made him stroke me gently with it.\\n', '\\n', 'In the midst of dinner, my mistress’s favourite cat leaped into her lap.\\n', 'I heard a noise behind me like that of a dozen stocking-weavers at work;\\n', 'and turning my head, I found it proceeded from the purring of that\\n', 'animal, who seemed to be three times larger than an ox, as I computed by\\n', 'the view of her head, and one of her paws, while her mistress was feeding\\n', 'and stroking her.  The fierceness of this creature’s countenance\\n', 'altogether discomposed me; though I stood at the farther end of the\\n', 'table, above fifty feet off; and although my mistress held her fast, for\\n', 'fear she might give a spring, and seize me in her talons.  But it\\n', 'happened there was no danger, for the cat took not the least notice of me\\n', 'when my master placed me within three yards of her.  And as I have been\\n', 'always told, and found true by experience in my travels, that flying or\\n', 'discovering fear before a fierce animal, is a certain way to make it\\n', 'pursue or attack you, so I resolved, in this dangerous juncture, to show\\n', 'no manner of concern.  I walked with intrepidity five or six times before\\n', 'the very head of the cat, and came within half a yard of her; whereupon\\n', 'she drew herself back, as if she were more afraid of me: I had less\\n', 'apprehension concerning the dogs, whereof three or four came into the\\n', 'room, as it is usual in farmers’ houses; one of which was a mastiff,\\n', 'equal in bulk to four elephants, and another a greyhound, somewhat taller\\n', 'than the mastiff, but not so large.\\n', '\\n', 'When dinner was almost done, the nurse came in with a child of a year old\\n', 'in her arms, who immediately spied me, and began a squall that you might\\n', 'have heard from London-Bridge to Chelsea, after the usual oratory of\\n', 'infants, to get me for a plaything.  The mother, out of pure indulgence,\\n', 'took me up, and put me towards the child, who presently seized me by the\\n', 'middle, and got my head into his mouth, where I roared so loud that the\\n', 'urchin was frighted, and let me drop, and I should infallibly have broke\\n', 'my neck, if the mother had not held her apron under me.  The nurse, to\\n', 'quiet her babe, made use of a rattle which was a kind of hollow vessel\\n', 'filled with great stones, and fastened by a cable to the child’s waist:\\n', 'but all in vain; so that she was forced to apply the last remedy by\\n', 'giving it suck.  I must confess no object ever disgusted me so much as\\n', 'the sight of her monstrous breast, which I cannot tell what to compare\\n', 'with, so as to give the curious reader an idea of its bulk, shape, and\\n', 'colour.  It stood prominent six feet, and could not be less than sixteen\\n', 'in circumference.  The nipple was about half the bigness of my head, and\\n', 'the hue both of that and the dug, so varied with spots, pimples, and\\n', 'freckles, that nothing could appear more nauseous: for I had a near sight\\n', 'of her, she sitting down, the more conveniently to give suck, and I\\n', 'standing on the table.  This made me reflect upon the fair skins of our\\n', 'English ladies, who appear so beautiful to us, only because they are of\\n', 'our own size, and their defects not to be seen but through a magnifying\\n', 'glass; where we find by experiment that the smoothest and whitest skins\\n', 'look rough, and coarse, and ill-coloured.\\n', '\\n', 'I remember when I was at Lilliput, the complexion of those diminutive\\n', 'people appeared to me the fairest in the world; and talking upon this\\n', 'subject with a person of learning there, who was an intimate friend of\\n', 'mine, he said that my face appeared much fairer and smoother when he\\n', 'looked on me from the ground, than it did upon a nearer view, when I took\\n', 'him up in my hand, and brought him close, which he confessed was at first\\n', 'a very shocking sight.  He said, “he could discover great holes in my\\n', 'skin; that the stumps of my beard were ten times stronger than the\\n', 'bristles of a boar, and my complexion made up of several colours\\n', 'altogether disagreeable:” although I must beg leave to say for myself,\\n', 'that I am as fair as most of my sex and country, and very little sunburnt\\n', 'by all my travels.  On the other side, discoursing of the ladies in that\\n', 'emperor’s court, he used to tell me, “one had freckles; another too wide\\n', 'a mouth; a third too large a nose;” nothing of which I was able to\\n', 'distinguish.  I confess this reflection was obvious enough; which,\\n', 'however, I could not forbear, lest the reader might think those vast\\n', 'creatures were actually deformed: for I must do them the justice to say,\\n', 'they are a comely race of people, and particularly the features of my\\n', 'master’s countenance, although he was but a farmer, when I beheld him\\n', 'from the height of sixty feet, appeared very well proportioned.\\n', '\\n', 'When dinner was done, my master went out to his labourers, and, as I\\n', 'could discover by his voice and gesture, gave his wife strict charge to\\n', 'take care of me.  I was very much tired, and disposed to sleep, which my\\n', 'mistress perceiving, she put me on her own bed, and covered me with a\\n', 'clean white handkerchief, but larger and coarser than the mainsail of a\\n', 'man-of-war.\\n', '\\n', 'I slept about two hours, and dreamt I was at home with my wife and\\n', 'children, which aggravated my sorrows when I awaked, and found myself\\n', 'alone in a vast room, between two and three hundred feet wide, and above\\n', 'two hundred high, lying in a bed twenty yards wide.  My mistress was gone\\n', 'about her household affairs, and had locked me in.  The bed was eight\\n', 'yards from the floor.  Some natural necessities required me to get down;\\n', 'I durst not presume to call; and if I had, it would have been in vain,\\n', 'with such a voice as mine, at so great a distance from the room where I\\n', 'lay to the kitchen where the family kept.  While I was under these\\n', 'circumstances, two rats crept up the curtains, and ran smelling backwards\\n', 'and forwards on the bed.  One of them came up almost to my face,\\n', 'whereupon I rose in a fright, and drew out my hanger to defend myself.\\n', 'These horrible animals had the boldness to attack me on both sides, and\\n', 'one of them held his fore-feet at my collar; but I had the good fortune\\n', 'to rip up his belly before he could do me any mischief.  He fell down at\\n', 'my feet; and the other, seeing the fate of his comrade, made his escape,\\n', 'but not without one good wound on the back, which I gave him as he fled,\\n', 'and made the blood run trickling from him.  After this exploit, I walked\\n', 'gently to and fro on the bed, to recover my breath and loss of spirits.\\n', 'These creatures were of the size of a large mastiff, but infinitely more\\n', 'nimble and fierce; so that if I had taken off my belt before I went to\\n', 'sleep, I must have infallibly been torn to pieces and devoured.  I\\n', 'measured the tail of the dead rat, and found it to be two yards long,\\n', 'wanting an inch; but it went against my stomach to drag the carcass off\\n', 'the bed, where it lay still bleeding; I observed it had yet some life,\\n', 'but with a strong slash across the neck, I thoroughly despatched it.\\n', '\\n', 'Soon after my mistress came into the room, who seeing me all bloody, ran\\n', 'and took me up in her hand.  I pointed to the dead rat, smiling, and\\n', 'making other signs to show I was not hurt; whereat she was extremely\\n', 'rejoiced, calling the maid to take up the dead rat with a pair of tongs,\\n', 'and throw it out of the window.  Then she set me on a table, where I\\n', 'showed her my hanger all bloody, and wiping it on the lappet of my coat,\\n', 'returned it to the scabbard.  I was pressed to do more than one thing\\n', 'which another could not do for me, and therefore endeavoured to make my\\n', 'mistress understand, that I desired to be set down on the floor; which\\n', 'after she had done, my bashfulness would not suffer me to express myself\\n', 'farther, than by pointing to the door, and bowing several times.  The\\n', 'good woman, with much difficulty, at last perceived what I would be at,\\n', 'and taking me up again in her hand, walked into the garden, where she set\\n', 'me down.  I went on one side about two hundred yards, and beckoning to\\n', 'her not to look or to follow me, I hid myself between two leaves of\\n', 'sorrel, and there discharged the necessities of nature.\\n', '\\n', 'I hope the gentle reader will excuse me for dwelling on these and the\\n', 'like particulars, which, however insignificant they may appear to\\n', 'groveling vulgar minds, yet will certainly help a philosopher to enlarge\\n', 'his thoughts and imagination, and apply them to the benefit of public as\\n', 'well as private life, which was my sole design in presenting this and\\n', 'other accounts of my travels to the world; wherein I have been chiefly\\n', 'studious of truth, without affecting any ornaments of learning or of\\n', 'style.  But the whole scene of this voyage made so strong an impression\\n', 'on my mind, and is so deeply fixed in my memory, that, in committing it\\n', 'to paper I did not omit one material circumstance: however, upon a strict\\n', 'review, I blotted out several passages.

Her mother and she contrived to fit up the baby’s cradle for me\\n', 'against night: the cradle was put into a small drawer of a cabinet, and\\n', 'the drawer placed upon a hanging shelf for fear of the rats.  This was my\\n', 'bed all the time I staid with those people, though made more convenient\\n', 'by degrees, as I began to learn their language and make my wants known.\\n', 'This young girl was so handy, that after I had once or twice pulled off\\n', 'my clothes before her, she was able to dress and undress me, though I\\n', 'never gave her that trouble when she would let me do either myself.  She\\n', 'made me seven shirts, and some other linen, of as fine cloth as could be\\n', 'got, which indeed was coarser than sackcloth; and these she constantly\\n', 'washed for me with her own hands.  She was likewise my school-mistress,\\n', 'to teach me the language: when I pointed to any thing, she told me the\\n', 'name of it in her own tongue, so that in a few days I was able to call\\n', 'for whatever I had a mind to.  She was very good-natured, and not above\\n', 'forty feet high, being little for her age.  She gave me the name of\\n', '_Grildrig_, which the family took up, and afterwards the whole kingdom.\\n', 'The word imports what the Latins call _nanunculus_, the Italians\\n', '_homunceletino_, and the English _mannikin_.  To her I chiefly owe my\\n', 'preservation in that country: we never parted while I was there; I called\\n', 'her my _Glumdalclitch_, or little nurse; and should be guilty of great\\n', 'ingratitude, if I omitted this honourable mention of her care and\\n', 'affection towards me, which I heartily wish it lay in my power to requite\\n', 'as she deserves, instead of being the innocent, but unhappy instrument of\\n', 'her disgrace, as I have too much reason to fear.\\n', '\\n', 'It now began to be known and talked of in the neighbourhood, that my\\n', 'master had found a strange animal in the field, about the bigness of a\\n', '_splacnuck_, but exactly shaped in every part like a human creature;\\n', 'which it likewise imitated in all its actions; seemed to speak in a\\n', 'little language of its own, had already learned several words of theirs,\\n', 'went erect upon two legs, was tame and gentle, would come when it was\\n', 'called, do whatever it was bid, had the finest limbs in the world, and a\\n', 'complexion fairer than a nobleman’s daughter of three years old.  Another\\n', 'farmer, who lived hard by, and was a particular friend of my master, came\\n', 'on a visit on purpose to inquire into the truth of this story.  I was\\n', 'immediately produced, and placed upon a table, where I walked as I was\\n', 'commanded, drew my hanger, put it up again, made my reverence to my\\n', 'master’s guest, asked him in his own language how he did, and told him\\n', '_he was welcome_, just as my little nurse had instructed me.  This man,\\n', 'who was old and dim-sighted, put on his spectacles to behold me better;\\n', 'at which I could not forbear laughing very heartily, for his eyes\\n', 'appeared like the full moon shining into a chamber at two windows.  Our\\n', 'people, who discovered the cause of my mirth, bore me company in\\n', 'laughing, at which the old fellow was fool enough to be angry and out of\\n', 'countenance.  He had the character of a great miser; and, to my\\n', 'misfortune, he well deserved it, by the cursed advice he gave my master,\\n', 'to show me as a sight upon a market-day in the next town, which was half\\n', 'an hour’s riding, about two-and-twenty miles from our house.  I guessed\\n', 'there was some mischief when I observed my master and his friend\\n', 'whispering together, sometimes pointing at me; and my fears made me fancy\\n', 'that I overheard and understood some of their words.  But the next\\n', 'morning Glumdalclitch, my little nurse, told me the whole matter, which\\n', 'she had cunningly picked out from her mother.  The poor girl laid me on\\n', 'her bosom, and fell a weeping with shame and grief.  She apprehended some\\n', 'mischief would happen to me from rude vulgar folks, who might squeeze me\\n', 'to death, or break one of my limbs by taking me in their hands.  She had\\n', 'also observed how modest I was in my nature, how nicely I regarded my\\n', 'honour, and what an indignity I should conceive it, to be exposed for\\n', 'money as a public spectacle, to the meanest of the people.  She said, her\\n', 'papa and mamma had promised that Grildrig should be hers; but now she\\n', 'found they meant to serve her as they did last year, when they pretended\\n', 'to give her a lamb, and yet, as soon as it was fat, sold it to a butcher.\\n', 'For my own part, I may truly affirm, that I was less concerned than my\\n', 'nurse.  I had a strong hope, which never left me, that I should one day\\n', 'recover my liberty: and as to the ignominy of being carried about for a\\n', 'monster, I considered myself to be a perfect stranger in the country, and\\n', 'that such a misfortune could never be charged upon me as a reproach, if\\n', 'ever I should return to England, since the king of Great Britain himself,\\n', 'in my condition, must have undergone the same distress.\\n', '\\n', 'My master, pursuant to the advice of his friend, carried me in a box the\\n', 'next market-day to the neighbouring town, and took along with him his\\n', 'little daughter, my nurse, upon a pillion behind him.  The box was close\\n', 'on every side, with a little door for me to go in and out, and a few\\n', 'gimlet holes to let in air.  The girl had been so careful as to put the\\n', 'quilt of her baby’s bed into it, for me to lie down on.  However, I was\\n', 'terribly shaken and discomposed in this journey, though it was but of\\n', 'half an hour: for the horse went about forty feet at every step and\\n', 'trotted so high, that the agitation was equal to the rising and falling\\n', 'of a ship in a great storm, but much more frequent.  Our journey was\\n', 'somewhat farther than from London to St. Alban’s.  My master alighted at\\n', 'an inn which he used to frequent; and after consulting awhile with the\\n', 'inn-keeper, and making some necessary preparations, he hired the\\n', '_grultrud_, or crier, to give notice through the town of a strange\\n', 'creature to be seen at the sign of the Green Eagle, not so big as a\\n', '_splacnuck_ (an animal in that country very finely shaped, about six feet\\n', 'long,) and in every part of the body resembling a human creature, could\\n', 'speak several words, and perform a hundred diverting tricks.\\n', '\\n', 'I was placed upon a table in the largest room of the inn, which might be\\n', 'near three hundred feet square.  My little nurse stood on a low stool\\n', 'close to the table, to take care of me, and direct what I should do.  My\\n', 'master, to avoid a crowd, would suffer only thirty people at a time to\\n', 'see me.  I walked about on the table as the girl commanded; she asked me\\n', 'questions, as far as she knew my understanding of the language reached,\\n', 'and I answered them as loud as I could.  I turned about several times to\\n', 'the company, paid my humble respects, said _they were welcome_, and used\\n', 'some other speeches I had been taught.  I took up a thimble filled with\\n', 'liquor, which Glumdalclitch had given me for a cup, and drank their\\n', 'health, I drew out my hanger, and flourished with it after the manner of\\n', 'fencers in England.  My nurse gave me a part of a straw, which I\\n', 'exercised as a pike, having learnt the art in my youth.  I was that day\\n', 'shown to twelve sets of company, and as often forced to act over again\\n', 'the same fopperies, till I was half dead with weariness and vexation; for\\n', 'those who had seen me made such wonderful reports, that the people were\\n', 'ready to break down the doors to come in.  My master, for his own\\n', 'interest, would not suffer any one to touch me except my nurse; and to\\n', 'prevent danger, benches were set round the table at such a distance as to\\n', 'put me out of every body’s reach.  However, an unlucky school-boy aimed a\\n', 'hazel nut directly at my head, which very narrowly missed me; otherwise\\n', 'it came with so much violence, that it would have infallibly knocked out\\n', 'my brains, for it was almost as large as a small pumpkin, but I had the\\n', 'satisfaction to see the young rogue well beaten, and turned out of the\\n', 'room.\\n', '\\n', 'My master gave public notice that he would show me again the next\\n', 'market-day; and in the meantime he prepared a convenient vehicle for me,\\n', 'which he had reason enough to do; for I was so tired with my first\\n', 'journey, and with entertaining company for eight hours together, that I\\n', 'could hardly stand upon my legs, or speak a word.  It was at least three\\n', 'days before I recovered my strength; and that I might have no rest at\\n', 'home, all the neighbouring gentlemen from a hundred miles round, hearing\\n', 'of my fame, came to see me at my master’s own house.  There could not be\\n', 'fewer than thirty persons with their wives and children (for the country\\n', 'is very populous;) and my master demanded the rate of a full room\\n', 'whenever he showed me at home, although it were only to a single family;\\n', 'so that for some time I had but little ease every day of the week (except\\n', 'Wednesday, which is their Sabbath,) although I were not carried to the\\n', 'town.\\n', '\\n', 'My master, finding how profitable I was likely to be, resolved to carry\\n', 'me to the most considerable cities of the kingdom.  Having therefore\\n', 'provided himself with all things necessary for a long journey, and\\n', 'settled his affairs at home, he took leave of his wife, and upon the 17th\\n', 'of August, 1703, about two months after my arrival, we set out for the\\n', 'metropolis, situate near the middle of that empire, and about three\\n', 'thousand miles distance from our house.  My master made his daughter\\n', 'Glumdalclitch ride behind him.  She carried me on her lap, in a box tied\\n', 'about her waist.  The girl had lined it on all sides with the softest\\n', 'cloth she could get, well quilted underneath, furnished it with her\\n', 'baby’s bed, provided me with linen and other necessaries, and made\\n', 'everything as convenient as she could.  We had no other company but a boy\\n', 'of the house, who rode after us with the luggage.\\n', '\\n', 'My master’s design was to show me in all the towns by the way, and to\\n', 'step out of the road for fifty or a hundred miles, to any village, or\\n', 'person of quality’s house, where he might expect custom.  We made easy\\n', 'journeys, of not above seven or eight score miles a-day; for\\n', 'Glumdalclitch, on purpose to spare me, complained she was tired with the\\n', 'trotting of the horse.  She often took me out of my box, at my own\\n', 'desire, to give me air, and show me the country, but always held me fast\\n', 'by a leading-string.  We passed over five or six rivers, many degrees\\n', 'broader and deeper than the Nile or the Ganges: and there was hardly a\\n', 'rivulet so small as the Thames at London-bridge.  We were ten weeks in\\n', 'our journey, and I was shown in eighteen large towns, besides many\\n', 'villages, and private families.\\n', '\\n', 'On the 26th day of October we arrived at the metropolis, called in their\\n', 'language _Lorbrulgrud_, or Pride of the Universe.  My master took a\\n', 'lodging in the principal street of the city, not far from the royal\\n', 'palace, and put out bills in the usual form, containing an exact\\n', 'description of my person and parts.  He hired a large room between three\\n', 'and four hundred feet wide.  He provided a table sixty feet in diameter,\\n', 'upon which I was to act my part, and pallisadoed it round three feet from\\n', 'the edge, and as many high, to prevent my falling over.  I was shown ten\\n', 'times a-day, to the wonder and satisfaction of all people.  I could now\\n', 'speak the language tolerably well, and perfectly understood every word,\\n', 'that was spoken to me.  Besides, I had learnt their alphabet, and could\\n', 'make a shift to explain a sentence here and there; for Glumdalclitch had\\n', 'been my instructor while we were at home, and at leisure hours during our\\n', 'journey.  She carried a little book in her pocket, not much larger than a\\n', 'Sanson’s Atlas; it was a common treatise for the use of young girls,\\n', 'giving a short account of their religion: out of this she taught me my\\n', 'letters, and interpreted the words.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER III.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The author sent for to court.  The queen buys him of his master the\\n', 'farmer, and presents him to the king.  He disputes with his majesty’s\\n', 'great scholars.  An apartment at court provided for the author.  He is in\\n', 'high favour with the queen.  He stands up for the honour of his own\\n', 'country.  His quarrels with the queen’s dwarf.\\n', '\\n', 'The frequent labours I underwent every day, made, in a few weeks, a very\\n', 'considerable change in my health: the more my master got by me, the more\\n', 'insatiable he grew.  I had quite lost my stomach, and was almost reduced\\n', 'to a skeleton.  The farmer observed it, and concluding I must soon die,\\n', 'resolved to make as good a hand of me as he could.  While he was thus\\n', 'reasoning and resolving with himself, a _sardral_, or gentleman-usher,\\n', 'came from court, commanding my master to carry me immediately thither for\\n', 'the diversion of the queen and her ladies.  Some of the latter had\\n', 'already been to see me, and reported strange things of my beauty,\\n', 'behaviour, and good sense.  Her majesty, and those who attended her, were\\n', 'beyond measure delighted with my demeanour.  I fell on my knees, and\\n', 'begged the honour of kissing her imperial foot; but this gracious\\n', 'princess held out her little finger towards me, after I was set on the\\n', 'table, which I embraced in both my arms, and put the tip of it with the\\n', 'utmost respect to my lip.  She made me some general questions about my\\n', 'country and my travels, which I answered as distinctly, and in as few\\n', 'words as I could.  She asked, “whether I could be content to live at\\n', 'court?”  I bowed down to the board of the table, and humbly answered\\n', '“that I was my master’s slave: but, if I were at my own disposal, I\\n', 'should be proud to devote my life to her majesty’s service.”  She then\\n', 'asked my master, “whether he was willing to sell me at a good price?”\\n', 'He, who apprehended I could not live a month, was ready enough to part\\n', 'with me, and demanded a thousand pieces of gold, which were ordered him\\n', 'on the spot, each piece being about the bigness of eight hundred\\n', 'moidores; but allowing for the proportion of all things between that\\n', 'country and Europe, and the high price of gold among them, was hardly so\\n', 'great a sum as a thousand guineas would be in England.  I then said to\\n', 'the queen, “since I was now her majesty’s most humble creature and\\n', 'vassal, I must beg the favour, that Glumdalclitch, who had always tended\\n', 'me with so much care and kindness, and understood to do it so well, might\\n', 'be admitted into her service, and continue to be my nurse and\\n', 'instructor.”\\n', '\\n', 'Her majesty agreed to my petition, and easily got the farmer’s consent,\\n', 'who was glad enough to have his daughter preferred at court, and the poor\\n', 'girl herself was not able to hide her joy.  My late master withdrew,\\n', 'bidding me farewell, and saying he had left me in a good service; to\\n', 'which I replied not a word, only making him a slight bow.\\n', '\\n', 'The queen observed my coldness; and, when the farmer was gone out of the\\n', 'apartment, asked me the reason.  I made bold to tell her majesty, “that I\\n', 'owed no other obligation to my late master, than his not dashing out the\\n', 'brains of a poor harmless creature, found by chance in his fields: which\\n', 'obligation was amply recompensed, by the gain he had made in showing me\\n', 'through half the kingdom, and the price he had now sold me for.  That the\\n', 'life I had since led was laborious enough to kill an animal of ten times\\n', 'my strength.  That my health was much impaired, by the continual drudgery\\n', 'of entertaining the rabble every hour of the day; and that, if my master\\n', 'had not thought my life in danger, her majesty would not have got so\\n', 'cheap a bargain.  But as I was out of all fear of being ill-treated under\\n', 'the protection of so great and good an empress, the ornament of nature,\\n', 'the darling of the world, the delight of her subjects, the phoenix of the\\n', 'creation, so I hoped my late master’s apprehensions would appear to be\\n', 'groundless; for I already found my spirits revive, by the influence of\\n', 'her most august presence.”\\n', '\\n', 'This was the sum of my speech, delivered with great improprieties and\\n', 'hesitation.  The latter part was altogether framed in the style peculiar\\n', 'to that people, whereof I learned some phrases from Glumdalclitch, while\\n', 'she was carrying me to court.\\n', '\\n', 'The queen, giving great allowance for my defectiveness in speaking, was,\\n', 'however, surprised at so much wit and good sense in so diminutive an\\n', 'animal.  She took me in her own hand, and carried me to the king, who was\\n', 'then retired to his cabinet.  His majesty, a prince of much gravity and\\n', 'austere countenance, not well observing my shape at first view, asked the\\n', 'queen after a cold manner “how long it was since she grew fond of a\\n', '_splacnuck_?” for such it seems he took me to be, as I lay upon my breast\\n', 'in her majesty’s right hand.  But this princess, who has an infinite deal\\n', 'of wit and humour, set me gently on my feet upon the scrutoire, and\\n', 'commanded me to give his majesty an account of myself, which I did in a\\n', 'very few words: and Glumdalclitch who attended at the cabinet door, and\\n', 'could not endure I should be out of her sight, being admitted, confirmed\\n', 'all that had passed from my arrival at her father’s house.\\n', '\\n', 'The king, although he be as learned a person as any in his dominions, had\\n', 'been educated in the study of philosophy, and particularly mathematics;\\n', 'yet when he observed my shape exactly, and saw me walk erect, before I\\n', 'began to speak, conceived I might be a piece of clock-work (which is in\\n', 'that country arrived to a very great perfection) contrived by some\\n', 'ingenious artist.  But when he heard my voice, and found what I delivered\\n', 'to be regular and rational, he could not conceal his astonishment.  He\\n', 'was by no means satisfied with the relation I gave him of the manner I\\n', 'came into his kingdom, but thought it a story concerted between\\n', 'Glumdalclitch and her father, who had taught me a set of words to make me\\n', 'sell at a better price.  Upon this imagination, he put several other\\n', 'questions to me, and still received rational answers: no otherwise\\n', 'defective than by a foreign accent, and an imperfect knowledge in the\\n', 'language, with some rustic phrases which I had learned at the farmer’s\\n', 'house, and did not suit the polite style of a court.\\n', '\\n', 'His majesty sent for three great scholars, who were then in their weekly\\n', 'waiting, according to the custom in that country.  These gentlemen, after\\n', 'they had a while examined my shape with much nicety, were of different\\n', 'opinions concerning me.  They all agreed that I could not be produced\\n', 'according to the regular laws of nature, because I was not framed with a\\n', 'capacity of preserving my life, either by swiftness, or climbing of\\n', 'trees, or digging holes in the earth.  They observed by my teeth, which\\n', 'they viewed with great exactness, that I was a carnivorous animal; yet\\n', 'most quadrupeds being an overmatch for me, and field mice, with some\\n', 'others, too nimble, they could not imagine how I should be able to\\n', 'support myself, unless I fed upon snails and other insects, which they\\n', 'offered, by many learned arguments, to evince that I could not possibly\\n', 'do.  One of these virtuosi seemed to think that I might be an embryo, or\\n', 'abortive birth.  But this opinion was rejected by the other two, who\\n', 'observed my limbs to be perfect and finished; and that I had lived\\n', 'several years, as it was manifest from my beard, the stumps whereof they\\n', 'plainly discovered through a magnifying glass.  They would not allow me\\n', 'to be a dwarf, because my littleness was beyond all degrees of\\n', 'comparison; for the queen’s favourite dwarf, the smallest ever known in\\n', 'that kingdom, was near thirty feet high.  After much debate, they\\n', 'concluded unanimously, that I was only _relplum scalcath_, which is\\n', 'interpreted literally _lusus naturæ_; a determination exactly agreeable\\n', 'to the modern philosophy of Europe, whose professors, disdaining the old\\n', 'evasion of occult causes, whereby the followers of Aristotle endeavoured\\n', 'in vain to disguise their ignorance, have invented this wonderful\\n', 'solution of all difficulties, to the unspeakable advancement of human\\n', 'knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'After this decisive conclusion, I entreated to be heard a word or two.  I\\n', 'applied myself to the king, and assured his majesty, “that I came from a\\n', 'country which abounded with several millions of both sexes, and of my own\\n', 'stature; where the animals, trees, and houses, were all in proportion,\\n', 'and where, by consequence, I might be as able to defend myself, and to\\n', 'find sustenance, as any of his majesty’s subjects could do here; which I\\n', 'took for a full answer to those gentlemen’s arguments.”  To this they\\n', 'only replied with a smile of contempt, saying, “that the farmer had\\n', 'instructed me very well in my lesson.”  The king, who had a much better\\n', 'understanding, dismissing his learned men, sent for the farmer, who by\\n', 'good fortune was not yet gone out of town.  Having therefore first\\n', 'examined him privately, and then confronted him with me and the young\\n', 'girl, his majesty began to think that what we told him might possibly be\\n', 'true. He desired the queen to order that a particular care should be\\n', 'taken of me; and was of opinion that Glumdalclitch should still continue\\n', 'in her office of tending me, because he observed we had a great affection\\n', 'for each other.  A convenient apartment was provided for her at court:\\n', 'she had a sort of governess appointed to take care of her education, a\\n', 'maid to dress her, and two other servants for menial offices; but the\\n', 'care of me was wholly appropriated to herself.  The queen commanded her\\n', 'own cabinet-maker to contrive a box, that might serve me for a\\n', 'bedchamber, after the model that Glumdalclitch and I should agree upon.\\n', 'This man was a most ingenious artist, and according to my direction, in\\n', 'three weeks finished for me a wooden chamber of sixteen feet square, and\\n', 'twelve high, with sash-windows, a door, and two closets, like a London\\n', 'bed-chamber.  The board, that made the ceiling, was to be lifted up and\\n', 'down by two hinges, to put in a bed ready furnished by her majesty’s\\n', 'upholsterer, which Glumdalclitch took out every day to air, made it with\\n', 'her own hands, and letting it down at night, locked up the roof over me.\\n', 'A nice workman, who was famous for little curiosities, undertook to make\\n', 'me two chairs, with backs and frames, of a substance not unlike ivory,\\n', 'and two tables, with a cabinet to put my things in.  The room was quilted\\n', 'on all sides, as well as the floor and the ceiling, to prevent any\\n', 'accident from the carelessness of those who carried me, and to break the\\n', 'force of a jolt, when I went in a coach.  I desired a lock for my door,\\n', 'to prevent rats and mice from coming in.  The smith, after several\\n', 'attempts, made the smallest that ever was seen among them, for I have\\n', 'known a larger at the gate of a gentleman’s house in England.  I made a\\n', 'shift to keep the key in a pocket of my own, fearing Glumdalclitch might\\n', 'lose it.  The queen likewise ordered the thinnest silks that could be\\n', 'gotten, to make me clothes, not much thicker than an English blanket,\\n', 'very cumbersome till I was accustomed to them.  They were after the\\n', 'fashion of the kingdom, partly resembling the Persian, and partly the\\n', 'Chinese, and are a very grave and decent habit.\\n', '\\n', 'The queen became so fond of my company, that she could not dine without\\n', 'me.  I had a table placed upon the same at which her majesty ate, just at\\n', 'her left elbow, and a chair to sit on.  Glumdalclitch stood on a stool on\\n', 'the floor near my table, to assist and take care of me.  I had an entire\\n', 'set of silver dishes and plates, and other necessaries, which, in\\n', 'proportion to those of the queen, were not much bigger than what I have\\n', 'seen in a London toy-shop for the furniture of a baby-house: these my\\n', 'little nurse kept in her pocket in a silver box, and gave me at meals as\\n', 'I wanted them, always cleaning them herself.  No person dined with the\\n', 'queen but the two princesses royal, the eldest sixteen years old, and the\\n', 'younger at that time thirteen and a month.  Her majesty used to put a bit\\n', 'of meat upon one of my dishes, out of which I carved for myself, and her\\n', 'diversion was to see me eat in miniature: for the queen (who had indeed\\n', 'but a weak stomach) took up, at one mouthful, as much as a dozen English\\n', 'farmers could eat at a meal, which to me was for some time a very\\n', 'nauseous sight.  She would craunch the wing of a lark, bones and all,\\n', 'between her teeth, although it were nine times as large as that of a\\n', 'full-grown turkey; and put a bit of bread into her mouth as big as two\\n', 'twelve-penny loaves.  She drank out of a golden cup, above a hogshead at\\n', 'a draught.  Her knives were twice as long as a scythe, set straight upon\\n', 'the handle.  The spoons, forks, and other instruments, were all in the\\n', 'same proportion.  I remember when Glumdalclitch carried me, out of\\n', 'curiosity, to see some of the tables at court, where ten or a dozen of\\n', 'those enormous knives and forks were lifted up together, I thought I had\\n', 'never till then beheld so terrible a sight.\\n', '\\n', 'It is the custom, that every Wednesday (which, as I have observed, is\\n', 'their Sabbath) the king and queen, with the royal issue of both sexes,\\n', 'dine together in the apartment of his majesty, to whom I was now become a\\n', 'great favourite; and at these times, my little chair and table were\\n', 'placed at his left hand, before one of the salt-cellars.  This prince\\n', 'took a pleasure in conversing with me, inquiring into the manners,\\n', 'religion, laws, government, and learning of Europe; wherein I gave him\\n', 'the best account I was able.  His apprehension was so clear, and his\\n', 'judgment so exact, that he made very wise reflections and observations\\n', 'upon all I said.  But I confess, that, after I had been a little too\\n', 'copious in talking of my own beloved country, of our trade and wars by\\n', 'sea and land, of our schisms in religion, and parties in the state; the\\n', 'prejudices of his education prevailed so far, that he could not forbear\\n', 'taking me up in his right hand, and stroking me gently with the other,\\n', 'after a hearty fit of laughing, asked me, “whether I was a whig or tory?”\\n', 'Then turning to his first minister, who waited behind him with a white\\n', 'staff, near as tall as the mainmast of the Royal Sovereign, he observed\\n', '“how contemptible a thing was human grandeur, which could be mimicked by\\n', 'such diminutive insects as I: and yet,” says he, “I dare engage these\\n', 'creatures have their titles and distinctions of honour; they contrive\\n', 'little nests and burrows, that they call houses and cities; they make a\\n', 'figure in dress and equipage; they love, they fight, they dispute, they\\n', 'cheat, they betray!”  And thus he continued on, while my colour came and\\n', 'went several times, with indignation, to hear our noble country, the\\n', 'mistress of arts and arms, the scourge of France, the arbitress of\\n', 'Europe, the seat of virtue, piety, honour, and truth, the pride and envy\\n', 'of the world, so contemptuously treated.\\n', '\\n', 'But as I was not in a condition to resent injuries, so upon mature\\n', 'thoughts I began to doubt whether I was injured or no.  For, after having\\n', 'been accustomed several months to the sight and converse of this people,\\n', 'and observed every object upon which I cast mine eyes to be of\\n', 'proportionable magnitude, the horror I had at first conceived from their\\n', 'bulk and aspect was so far worn off, that if I had then beheld a company\\n', 'of English lords and ladies in their finery and birth-day clothes, acting\\n', 'their several parts in the most courtly manner of strutting, and bowing,\\n', 'and prating, to say the truth, I should have been strongly tempted to\\n', 'laugh as much at them as the king and his grandees did at me.  Neither,\\n', 'indeed, could I forbear smiling at myself, when the queen used to place\\n', 'me upon her hand towards a looking-glass, by which both our persons\\n', 'appeared before me in full view together; and there could be nothing more\\n', 'ridiculous than the comparison; so that I really began to imagine myself\\n', 'dwindled many degrees below my usual size.\\n', '\\n', 'Nothing angered and mortified me so much as the queen’s dwarf; who being\\n', 'of the lowest stature that was ever in that country (for I verily think\\n', 'he was not full thirty feet high), became so insolent at seeing a\\n', 'creature so much beneath him, that he would always affect to swagger and\\n', 'look big as he passed by me in the queen’s antechamber, while I was\\n', 'standing on some table talking with the lords or ladies of the court, and\\n', 'he seldom failed of a smart word or two upon my littleness; against which\\n', 'I could only revenge myself by calling him brother, challenging him to\\n', 'wrestle, and such repartees as are usually in the mouths of court pages.\\n', 'One day, at dinner, this malicious little cub was so nettled with\\n', 'something I had said to him, that, raising himself upon the frame of her\\n', 'majesty’s chair, he took me up by the middle, as I was sitting down, not\\n', 'thinking any harm, and let me drop into a large silver bowl of cream, and\\n', 'then ran away as fast as he could.  I fell over head and ears, and, if I\\n', 'had not been a good swimmer, it might have gone very hard with me; for\\n', 'Glumdalclitch in that instant happened to be at the other end of the\\n', 'room, and the queen was in such a fright, that she wanted presence of\\n', 'mind to assist me.  But my little nurse ran to my relief, and took me\\n', 'out, after I had swallowed above a quart of cream.  I was put to bed:\\n', 'however, I received no other damage than the loss of a suit of clothes,\\n', 'which was utterly spoiled.  The dwarf was soundly whipt, and as a farther\\n', 'punishment, forced to drink up the bowl of cream into which he had thrown\\n', 'me: neither was he ever restored to favour; for soon after the queen\\n', 'bestowed him on a lady of high quality, so that I saw him no more, to my\\n', 'very great satisfaction; for I could not tell to what extremities such a\\n', 'malicious urchin might have carried his resentment.\\n', '\\n', 'He had before served me a scurvy trick, which set the queen a-laughing,\\n', 'although at the same time she was heartily vexed, and would have\\n', 'immediately cashiered him, if I had not been so generous as to intercede.\\n', 'Her majesty had taken a marrow-bone upon her plate, and, after knocking\\n', 'out the marrow, placed the bone again in the dish erect, as it stood\\n', 'before; the dwarf, watching his opportunity, while Glumdalclitch was gone\\n', 'to the side-board, mounted the stool that she stood on to take care of me\\n', 'at meals, took me up in both hands, and squeezing my legs together,\\n', 'wedged them into the marrow bone above my waist, where I stuck for some\\n', 'time, and made a very ridiculous figure.  I believe it was near a minute\\n', 'before any one knew what was become of me; for I thought it below me to\\n', 'cry out.  But, as princes seldom get their meat hot, my legs were not\\n', 'scalded, only my stockings and breeches in a sad condition.  The dwarf,\\n', 'at my entreaty, had no other punishment than a sound whipping.\\n', '\\n', 'I was frequently rallied by the queen upon account of my fearfulness; and\\n', 'she used to ask me whether the people of my country were as great cowards\\n', 'as myself?  The occasion was this: the kingdom is much pestered with\\n', 'flies in summer; and these odious insects, each of them as big as a\\n', 'Dunstable lark, hardly gave me any rest while I sat at dinner, with their\\n', 'continual humming and buzzing about mine ears.  They would sometimes\\n', 'alight upon my victuals, and leave their loathsome excrement, or spawn\\n', 'behind, which to me was very visible, though not to the natives of that\\n', 'country, whose large optics were not so acute as mine, in viewing smaller\\n', 'objects.  Sometimes they would fix upon my nose, or forehead, where they\\n', 'stung me to the quick, smelling very offensively; and I could easily\\n', 'trace that viscous matter, which, our naturalists tell us, enables those\\n', 'creatures to walk with their feet upwards upon a ceiling.  I had much ado\\n', 'to defend myself against these detestable animals, and could not forbear\\n', 'starting when they came on my face.  It was the common practice of the\\n', 'dwarf, to catch a number of these insects in his hand, as schoolboys do\\n', 'among us, and let them out suddenly under my nose, on purpose to frighten\\n', 'me, and divert the queen.  My remedy was to cut them in pieces with my\\n', 'knife, as they flew in the air, wherein my dexterity was much admired.\\n', '\\n', 'I remember, one morning, when Glumdalclitch had set me in a box upon a\\n', 'window, as she usually did in fair days to give me air (for I durst not\\n', 'venture to let the box be hung on a nail out of the window, as we do with\\n', 'cages in England), after I had lifted up one of my sashes, and sat down\\n', 'at my table to eat a piece of sweet cake for my breakfast, above twenty\\n', 'wasps, allured by the smell, came flying into the room, humming louder\\n', 'than the drones of as many bagpipes.  Some of them seized my cake, and\\n', 'carried it piecemeal away; others flew about my head and face,\\n', 'confounding me with the noise, and putting me in the utmost terror of\\n', 'their stings.  However, I had the courage to rise and draw my hanger, and\\n', 'attack them in the air.  I dispatched four of them, but the rest got\\n', 'away, and I presently shut my window.  These insects were as large as\\n', 'partridges: I took out their stings, found them an inch and a half long,\\n', 'and as sharp as needles.  I carefully preserved them all; and having\\n', 'since shown them, with some other curiosities, in several parts of\\n', 'Europe, upon my return to England I gave three of them to Gresham\\n', 'College, and kept the fourth for myself.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER IV.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The country described.  A proposal for correcting modern maps.  The\\n', 'king’s palace; and some account of the metropolis.  The author’s way of\\n', 'travelling.  The chief temple described.\\n', '\\n', 'I now intend to give the reader a short description of this country, as\\n', 'far as I travelled in it, which was not above two thousand miles round\\n', 'Lorbrulgrud, the metropolis.  For the queen, whom I always attended,\\n', 'never went farther when she accompanied the king in his progresses, and\\n', 'there staid till his majesty returned from viewing his frontiers.  The\\n', 'whole extent of this prince’s dominions reaches about six thousand miles\\n', 'in length, and from three to five in breadth: whence I cannot but\\n', 'conclude, that our geographers of Europe are in a great error, by\\n', 'supposing nothing but sea between Japan and California; for it was ever\\n', 'my opinion, that there must be a balance of earth to counterpoise the\\n', 'great continent of Tartary; and therefore they ought to correct their\\n', 'maps and charts, by joining this vast tract of land to the north-west\\n', 'parts of America, wherein I shall be ready to lend them my assistance.\\n', '\\n', 'The kingdom is a peninsula, terminated to the north-east by a ridge of\\n', 'mountains thirty miles high, which are altogether impassable, by reason\\n', 'of the volcanoes upon the tops: neither do the most learned know what\\n', 'sort of mortals inhabit beyond those mountains, or whether they be\\n', 'inhabited at all.  On the three other sides, it is bounded by the ocean.\\n', 'There is not one seaport in the whole kingdom: and those parts of the\\n', 'coasts into which the rivers issue, are so full of pointed rocks, and the\\n', 'sea generally so rough, that there is no venturing with the smallest of\\n', 'their boats; so that these people are wholly excluded from any commerce\\n', 'with the rest of the world.  But the large rivers are full of vessels,\\n', 'and abound with excellent fish; for they seldom get any from the sea,\\n', 'because the sea fish are of the same size with those in Europe, and\\n', 'consequently not worth catching; whereby it is manifest, that nature, in\\n', 'the production of plants and animals of so extraordinary a bulk, is\\n', 'wholly confined to this continent, of which I leave the reasons to be\\n', 'determined by philosophers.  However, now and then they take a whale that\\n', 'happens to be dashed against the rocks, which the common people feed on\\n', 'heartily.  These whales I have known so large, that a man could hardly\\n', 'carry one upon his shoulders; and sometimes, for curiosity, they are\\n', 'brought in hampers to Lorbrulgrud; I saw one of them in a dish at the\\n', 'king’s table, which passed for a rarity, but I did not observe he was\\n', 'fond of it; for I think, indeed, the bigness disgusted him, although I\\n', 'have seen one somewhat larger in Greenland.\\n', '\\n', 'The country is well inhabited, for it contains fifty-one cities, near a\\n', 'hundred walled towns, and a great number of villages.  To satisfy my\\n', 'curious reader, it may be sufficient to describe Lorbrulgrud.  This city\\n', 'stands upon almost two equal parts, on each side the river that passes\\n', 'through.  It contains above eighty thousand houses, and about six hundred\\n', 'thousand inhabitants.  It is in length three _glomglungs_ (which make\\n', 'about fifty-four English miles,) and two and a half in breadth; as I\\n', 'measured it myself in the royal map made by the king’s order, which was\\n', 'laid on the ground on purpose for me, and extended a hundred feet: I\\n', 'paced the diameter and circumference several times barefoot, and,\\n', 'computing by the scale, measured it pretty exactly.\\n', '\\n', 'The king’s palace is no regular edifice, but a heap of buildings, about\\n', 'seven miles round: the chief rooms are generally two hundred and forty\\n', 'feet high, and broad and long in proportion.  A coach was allowed to\\n', 'Glumdalclitch and me, wherein her governess frequently took her out to\\n', 'see the town, or go among the shops; and I was always of the party,\\n', 'carried in my box; although the girl, at my own desire, would often take\\n', 'me out, and hold me in her hand, that I might more conveniently view the\\n', 'houses and the people, as we passed along the streets.  I reckoned our\\n', 'coach to be about a square of Westminster-hall, but not altogether so\\n', 'high: however, I cannot be very exact.  One day the governess ordered our\\n', 'coachman to stop at several shops, where the beggars, watching their\\n', 'opportunity, crowded to the sides of the coach, and gave me the most\\n', 'horrible spectacle that ever a European eye beheld.  There was a woman\\n', 'with a cancer in her breast, swelled to a monstrous size, full of holes,\\n', 'in two or three of which I could have easily crept, and covered my whole\\n', 'body.  There was a fellow with a wen in his neck, larger than five\\n', 'wool-packs; and another, with a couple of wooden legs, each about twenty\\n', 'feet high.  But the most hateful sight of all, was the lice crawling on\\n', 'their clothes.  I could see distinctly the limbs of these vermin with my\\n', 'naked eye, much better than those of a European louse through a\\n', 'microscope, and their snouts with which they rooted like swine.  They\\n', 'were the first I had ever beheld, and I should have been curious enough\\n', 'to dissect one of them, if I had had proper instruments, which I\\n', 'unluckily left behind me in the ship, although, indeed, the sight was so\\n', 'nauseous, that it perfectly turned my stomach.\\n', '\\n', 'Besides the large box in which I was usually carried, the queen ordered a\\n', 'smaller one to be made for me, of about twelve feet square, and ten high,\\n', 'for the convenience of travelling; because the other was somewhat too\\n', 'large for Glumdalclitch’s lap, and cumbersome in the coach; it was made\\n', 'by the same artist, whom I directed in the whole contrivance.  This\\n', 'travelling-closet was an exact square, with a window in the middle of\\n', 'three of the squares, and each window was latticed with iron wire on the\\n', 'outside, to prevent accidents in long journeys.  On the fourth side,\\n', 'which had no window, two strong staples were fixed, through which the\\n', 'person that carried me, when I had a mind to be on horseback, put a\\n', 'leathern belt, and buckled it about his waist.  This was always the\\n', 'office of some grave trusty servant, in whom I could confide, whether I\\n', 'attended the king and queen in their progresses, or were disposed to see\\n', 'the gardens, or pay a visit to some great lady or minister of state in\\n', 'the court, when Glumdalclitch happened to be out of order; for I soon\\n', 'began to be known and esteemed among the greatest officers, I suppose\\n', 'more upon account of their majesties’ favour, than any merit of my own.\\n', 'In journeys, when I was weary of the coach, a servant on horseback would\\n', 'buckle on my box, and place it upon a cushion before him; and there I had\\n', 'a full prospect of the country on three sides, from my three windows.  I\\n', 'had, in this closet, a field-bed and a hammock, hung from the ceiling,\\n', 'two chairs and a table, neatly screwed to the floor, to prevent being\\n', 'tossed about by the agitation of the horse or the coach.  And having been\\n', 'long used to sea-voyages, those motions, although sometimes very violent,\\n', 'did not much discompose me.\\n', '\\n', 'Whenever I had a mind to see the town, it was always in my\\n', 'travelling-closet; which Glumdalclitch held in her lap in a kind of open\\n', 'sedan, after the fashion of the country, borne by four men, and attended\\n', 'by two others in the queen’s livery.  The people, who had often heard of\\n', 'me, were very curious to crowd about the sedan, and the girl was\\n', 'complaisant enough to make the bearers stop, and to take me in her hand,\\n', 'that I might be more conveniently seen.\\n', '\\n', 'I was very desirous to see the chief temple, and particularly the tower\\n', 'belonging to it, which is reckoned the highest in the kingdom.\\n', 'Accordingly one day my nurse carried me thither, but I may truly say I\\n', 'came back disappointed; for the height is not above three thousand feet,\\n', 'reckoning from the ground to the highest pinnacle top; which, allowing\\n', 'for the difference between the size of those people and us in Europe, is\\n', 'no great matter for admiration, nor at all equal in proportion (if I\\n', 'rightly remember) to Salisbury steeple.  But, not to detract from a\\n', 'nation, to which, during my life, I shall acknowledge myself extremely\\n', 'obliged, it must be allowed, that whatever this famous tower wants in\\n', 'height, is amply made up in beauty and strength: for the walls are near a\\n', 'hundred feet thick, built of hewn stone, whereof each is about forty feet\\n', 'square, and adorned on all sides with statues of gods and emperors, cut\\n', 'in marble, larger than the life, placed in their several niches.  I\\n', 'measured a little finger which had fallen down from one of these statues,\\n', 'and lay unperceived among some rubbish, and found it exactly four feet\\n', 'and an inch in length.  Glumdalclitch wrapped it up in her handkerchief,\\n', 'and carried it home in her pocket, to keep among other trinkets, of which\\n', 'the girl was very fond, as children at her age usually are.\\n', '\\n', 'The king’s kitchen is indeed a noble building, vaulted at top, and about\\n', 'six hundred feet high.  The great oven is not so wide, by ten paces, as\\n', 'the cupola at St. Paul’s: for I measured the latter on purpose, after my\\n', 'return.  But if I should describe the kitchen grate, the prodigious pots\\n', 'and kettles, the joints of meat turning on the spits, with many other\\n', 'particulars, perhaps I should be hardly believed; at least a severe\\n', 'critic would be apt to think I enlarged a little, as travellers are often\\n', 'suspected to do.  To avoid which censure I fear I have run too much into\\n', 'the other extreme; and that if this treatise should happen to be\\n', 'translated into the language of Brobdingnag (which is the general name of\\n', 'that kingdom,) and transmitted thither, the king and his people would\\n', 'have reason to complain that I had done them an injury, by a false and\\n', 'diminutive representation.\\n', '\\n', 'His majesty seldom keeps above six hundred horses in his stables: they\\n', 'are generally from fifty-four to sixty feet high.  But, when he goes\\n', 'abroad on solemn days, he is attended, for state, by a military guard of\\n', 'five hundred horse, which, indeed, I thought was the most splendid sight\\n', 'that could be ever beheld, till I saw part of his army in battalia,\\n', 'whereof I shall find another occasion to speak.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER V.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Several adventurers that happened to the author.  The execution of a\\n', 'criminal.  The author shows his skill in navigation.\\n', '\\n', 'I should have lived happy enough in that country, if my littleness had\\n', 'not exposed me to several ridiculous and troublesome accidents; some of\\n', 'which I shall venture to relate.  Glumdalclitch often carried me into the\\n', 'gardens of the court in my smaller box, and would sometimes take me out\\n', 'of it, and hold me in her hand, or set me down to walk.  I remember,\\n', 'before the dwarf left the queen, he followed us one day into those\\n', 'gardens, and my nurse having set me down, he and I being close together,\\n', 'near some dwarf apple trees, I must needs show my wit, by a silly\\n', 'allusion between him and the trees, which happens to hold in their\\n', 'language as it does in ours.  Whereupon, the malicious rogue, watching\\n', 'his opportunity, when I was walking under one of them, shook it directly\\n', 'over my head, by which a dozen apples, each of them near as large as a\\n', 'Bristol barrel, came tumbling about my ears; one of them hit me on the\\n', 'back as I chanced to stoop, and knocked me down flat on my face; but I\\n', 'received no other hurt, and the dwarf was pardoned at my desire, because\\n', 'I had given the provocation.\\n', '\\n', 'Another day, Glumdalclitch left me on a smooth grass-plot to divert\\n', 'myself, while she walked at some distance with her governess.  In the\\n', 'meantime, there suddenly fell such a violent shower of hail, that I was\\n', 'immediately by the force of it, struck to the ground: and when I was\\n', 'down, the hailstones gave me such cruel bangs all over the body, as if I\\n', 'had been pelted with tennis-balls; however, I made a shift to creep on\\n', 'all fours, and shelter myself, by lying flat on my face, on the lee-side\\n', 'of a border of lemon-thyme, but so bruised from head to foot, that I\\n', 'could not go abroad in ten days.  Neither is this at all to be wondered\\n', 'at, because nature, in that country, observing the same proportion\\n', 'through all her operations, a hailstone is near eighteen hundred times as\\n', 'large as one in Europe; which I can assert upon experience, having been\\n', 'so curious as to weigh and measure them.\\n', '\\n', 'But a more dangerous accident happened to me in the same garden, when my\\n', 'little nurse, believing she had put me in a secure place (which I often\\n', 'entreated her to do, that I might enjoy my own thoughts,) and having left\\n', 'my box at home, to avoid the trouble of carrying it, went to another part\\n', 'of the garden with her governess and some ladies of her acquaintance.\\n', 'While she was absent, and out of hearing, a small white spaniel that\\n', 'belonged to one of the chief gardeners, having got by accident into the\\n', 'garden, happened to range near the place where I lay: the dog, following\\n', 'the scent, came directly up, and taking me in his mouth, ran straight to\\n', 'his master wagging his tail, and set me gently on the ground.  By good\\n', 'fortune he had been so well taught, that I was carried between his teeth\\n', 'without the least hurt, or even tearing my clothes.  But the poor\\n', 'gardener, who knew me well, and had a great kindness for me, was in a\\n', 'terrible fright: he gently took me up in both his hands, and asked me how\\n', 'I did? but I was so amazed and out of breath, that I could not speak a\\n', 'word.  In a few minutes I came to myself, and he carried me safe to my\\n', 'little nurse, who, by this time, had returned to the place where she left\\n', 'me, and was in cruel agonies when I did not appear, nor answer when she\\n', 'called.  She severely reprimanded the gardener on account of his dog.\\n', 'But the thing was hushed up, and never known at court, for the girl was\\n', 'afraid of the queen’s anger; and truly, as to myself, I thought it would\\n', 'not be for my reputation, that such a story should go about.\\n', '\\n', 'This accident absolutely determined Glumdalclitch never to trust me\\n', 'abroad for the future out of her sight.  I had been long afraid of this\\n', 'resolution, and therefore concealed from her some little unlucky\\n', 'adventures, that happened in those times when I was left by myself.  Once\\n', 'a kite, hovering over the garden, made a stoop at me, and if I had not\\n', 'resolutely drawn my hanger, and run under a thick espalier, he would have\\n', 'certainly carried me away in his talons.  Another time, walking to the\\n', 'top of a fresh mole-hill, I fell to my neck in the hole, through which\\n', 'that animal had cast up the earth, and coined some lie, not worth\\n', 'remembering, to excuse myself for spoiling my clothes.  I likewise broke\\n', 'my right shin against the shell of a snail, which I happened to stumble\\n', 'over, as I was walking alone and thinking on poor England.\\n', '\\n', 'I cannot tell whether I were more pleased or mortified to observe, in\\n', 'those solitary walks, that the smaller birds did not appear to be at all\\n', 'afraid of me, but would hop about within a yard’s distance, looking for\\n', 'worms and other food, with as much indifference and security as if no\\n', 'creature at all were near them.  I remember, a thrush had the confidence\\n', 'to snatch out of my hand, with his bill, a of cake that Glumdalclitch had\\n', 'just given me for my breakfast.  When I attempted to catch any of these\\n', 'birds, they would boldly turn against me, endeavouring to peck my\\n', 'fingers, which I durst not venture within their reach; and then they\\n', 'would hop back unconcerned, to hunt for worms or snails, as they did\\n', 'before.  But one day, I took a thick cudgel, and threw it with all my\\n', 'strength so luckily, at a linnet, that I knocked him down, and seizing\\n', 'him by the neck with both my hands, ran with him in triumph to my nurse.\\n', 'However, the bird, who had only been stunned, recovering himself gave me\\n', 'so many boxes with his wings, on both sides of my head and body, though I\\n', 'held him at arm’s-length, and was out of the reach of his claws, that I\\n', 'was twenty times thinking to let him go.  But I was soon relieved by one\\n', 'of our servants, who wrung off the bird’s neck, and I had him next day\\n', 'for dinner, by the queen’s command.  This linnet, as near as I can\\n', 'remember, seemed to be somewhat larger than an English swan.\\n', '\\n', 'The maids of honour often invited Glumdalclitch to their apartments, and\\n', 'desired she would bring me along with her, on purpose to have the\\n', 'pleasure of seeing and touching me.  They would often strip me naked from\\n', 'top to toe, and lay me at full length in their bosoms; wherewith I was\\n', 'much disgusted because, to say the truth, a very offensive smell came\\n', 'from their skins; which I do not mention, or intend, to the disadvantage\\n', 'of those excellent ladies, for whom I have all manner of respect; but I\\n', 'conceive that my sense was more acute in proportion to my littleness, and\\n', 'that those illustrious persons were no more disagreeable to their lovers,\\n', 'or to each other, than people of the same quality are with us in England.\\n', 'And, after all, I found their natural smell was much more supportable,\\n', 'than when they used perfumes, under which I immediately swooned away.  I\\n', 'cannot forget, that an intimate friend of mine in Lilliput, took the\\n', 'freedom in a warm day, when I had used a good deal of exercise, to\\n', 'complain of a strong smell about me, although I am as little faulty that\\n', 'way, as most of my sex: but I suppose his faculty of smelling was as nice\\n', 'with regard to me, as mine was to that of this people.  Upon this point,\\n', 'I cannot forbear doing justice to the queen my mistress, and\\n', 'Glumdalclitch my nurse, whose persons were as sweet as those of any lady\\n', 'in England.\\n', '\\n', 'That which gave me most uneasiness among these maids of honour (when my\\n', 'nurse carried me to visit then) was, to see them use me without any\\n', 'manner of ceremony, like a creature who had no sort of consequence: for\\n', 'they would strip themselves to the skin, and put on their smocks in my\\n', 'presence, while I was placed on their toilet, directly before their naked\\n', 'bodies, which I am sure to me was very far from being a tempting sight,\\n', 'or from giving me any other emotions than those of horror and disgust:\\n', 'their skins appeared so coarse and uneven, so variously coloured, when I\\n', 'saw them near, with a mole here and there as broad as a trencher, and\\n', 'hairs hanging from it thicker than packthreads, to say nothing farther\\n', 'concerning the rest of their persons.  Neither did they at all scruple,\\n', 'while I was by, to discharge what they had drank, to the quantity of at\\n', 'least two hogsheads, in a vessel that held above three tuns.  The\\n', 'handsomest among these maids of honour, a pleasant, frolicsome girl of\\n', 'sixteen, would sometimes set me astride upon one of her nipples, with\\n', 'many other tricks, wherein the reader will excuse me for not being over\\n', 'particular.  But I was so much displeased, that I entreated Glumdalclitch\\n', 'to contrive some excuse for not seeing that young lady any more.\\n', '\\n', 'One day, a young gentleman, who was nephew to my nurse’s governess, came\\n', 'and pressed them both to see an execution.  It was of a man, who had\\n', 'murdered one of that gentleman’s intimate acquaintance.  Glumdalclitch\\n', 'was prevailed on to be of the company, very much against her inclination,\\n', 'for she was naturally tender-hearted: and, as for myself, although I\\n', 'abhorred such kind of spectacles, yet my curiosity tempted me to see\\n', 'something that I thought must be extraordinary.  The malefactor was fixed\\n', 'in a chair upon a scaffold erected for that purpose, and his head cut off\\n', 'at one blow, with a sword of about forty feet long.  The veins and\\n', 'arteries spouted up such a prodigious quantity of blood, and so high in\\n', 'the air, that the great _jet d’eau_ at Versailles was not equal to it for\\n', 'the time it lasted: and the head, when it fell on the scaffold floor,\\n', 'gave such a bounce as made me start, although I was at least half an\\n', 'English mile distant.\\n', '\\n', 'The queen, who often used to hear me talk of my sea-voyages, and took all\\n', 'occasions to divert me when I was melancholy, asked me whether I\\n', 'understood how to handle a sail or an oar, and whether a little exercise\\n', 'of rowing might not be convenient for my health?  I answered, that I\\n', 'understood both very well: for although my proper employment had been to\\n', 'be surgeon or doctor to the ship, yet often, upon a pinch, I was forced\\n', 'to work like a common mariner.  But I could not see how this could be\\n', 'done in their country, where the smallest wherry was equal to a\\n', 'first-rate man of war among us; and such a boat as I could manage would\\n', 'never live in any of their rivers.  Her majesty said, if I would contrive\\n', 'a boat, her own joiner should make it, and she would provide a place for\\n', 'me to sail in.  The fellow was an ingenious workman, and by my\\n', 'instructions, in ten days, finished a pleasure-boat with all its\\n', 'tackling, able conveniently to hold eight Europeans.  When it was\\n', 'finished, the queen was so delighted, that she ran with it in her lap to\\n', 'the king, who ordered it to be put into a cistern full of water, with me\\n', 'in it, by way of trial, where I could not manage my two sculls, or little\\n', 'oars, for want of room.  But the queen had before contrived another\\n', 'project.  She ordered the joiner to make a wooden trough of three hundred\\n', 'feet long, fifty broad, and eight deep; which, being well pitched, to\\n', 'prevent leaking, was placed on the floor, along the wall, in an outer\\n', 'room of the palace.  It had a cock near the bottom to let out the water,\\n', 'when it began to grow stale; and two servants could easily fill it in\\n', 'half an hour.  Here I often used to row for my own diversion, as well as\\n', 'that of the queen and her ladies, who thought themselves well entertained\\n', 'with my skill and agility.  Sometimes I would put up my sail, and then my\\n', 'business was only to steer, while the ladies gave me a gale with their\\n', 'fans; and, when they were weary, some of their pages would blow my sail\\n', 'forward with their breath, while I showed my art by steering starboard or\\n', 'larboard as I pleased.  When I had done, Glumdalclitch always carried\\n', 'back my boat into her closet, and hung it on a nail to dry.\\n', '\\n', 'In this exercise I once met an accident, which had like to have cost me\\n', 'my life; for, one of the pages having put my boat into the trough, the\\n', 'governess who attended Glumdalclitch very officiously lifted me up, to\\n', 'place me in the boat: but I happened to slip through her fingers, and\\n', 'should infallibly have fallen down forty feet upon the floor, if, by the\\n', 'luckiest chance in the world, I had not been stopped by a corking-pin\\n', 'that stuck in the good gentlewoman’s stomacher; the head of the pin\\n', 'passing between my shirt and the waistband of my breeches, and thus I was\\n', 'held by the middle in the air, till Glumdalclitch ran to my relief.\\n', '\\n', 'Another time, one of the servants, whose office it was to fill my trough\\n', 'every third day with fresh water, was so careless as to let a huge frog\\n', '(not perceiving it) slip out of his pail.  The frog lay concealed till I\\n', 'was put into my boat, but then, seeing a resting-place, climbed up, and\\n', 'made it lean so much on one side, that I was forced to balance it with\\n', 'all my weight on the other, to prevent overturning.  When the frog was\\n', 'got in, it hopped at once half the length of the boat, and then over my\\n', 'head, backward and forward, daubing my face and clothes with its odious\\n', 'slime.  The largeness of its features made it appear the most deformed\\n', 'animal that can be conceived.  However, I desired Glumdalclitch to let me\\n', 'deal with it alone.  I banged it a good while with one of my sculls, and\\n', 'at last forced it to leap out of the boat.\\n', '\\n', 'But the greatest danger I ever underwent in that kingdom, was from a\\n', 'monkey, who belonged to one of the clerks of the kitchen.  Glumdalclitch\\n', 'had locked me up in her closet, while she went somewhere upon business,\\n', 'or a visit.  The weather being very warm, the closet-window was left\\n', 'open, as well as the windows and the door of my bigger box, in which I\\n', 'usually lived, because of its largeness and conveniency.  As I sat\\n', 'quietly meditating at my table, I heard something bounce in at the\\n', 'closet-window, and skip about from one side to the other: whereat,\\n', 'although I was much alarmed, yet I ventured to look out, but not stirring\\n', 'from my seat; and then I saw this frolicsome animal frisking and leaping\\n', 'up and down, till at last he came to my box, which he seemed to view with\\n', 'great pleasure and curiosity, peeping in at the door and every window.  I\\n', 'retreated to the farther corner of my room; or box; but the monkey\\n', 'looking in at every side, put me in such a fright, that I wanted presence\\n', 'of mind to conceal myself under the bed, as I might easily have done.\\n', 'After some time spent in peeping, grinning, and chattering, he at last\\n', 'espied me; and reaching one of his paws in at the door, as a cat does\\n', 'when she plays with a mouse, although I often shifted place to avoid him,\\n', 'he at length seized the lappet of my coat (which being made of that\\n', 'country silk, was very thick and strong), and dragged me out.  He took me\\n', 'up in his right fore-foot and held me as a nurse does a child she is\\n', 'going to suckle, just as I have seen the same sort of creature do with a\\n', 'kitten in Europe; and when I offered to struggle he squeezed me so hard,\\n', 'that I thought it more prudent to submit.  I have good reason to believe,\\n', 'that he took me for a young one of his own species, by his often stroking\\n', 'my face very gently with his other paw.  In these diversions he was\\n', 'interrupted by a noise at the closet door, as if somebody were opening\\n', 'it: whereupon he suddenly leaped up to the window at which he had come\\n', 'in, and thence upon the leads and gutters, walking upon three legs, and\\n', 'holding me in the fourth, till he clambered up to a roof that was next to\\n', 'ours.  I heard Glumdalclitch give a shriek at the moment he was carrying\\n', 'me out.  The poor girl was almost distracted: that quarter of the palace\\n', 'was all in an uproar; the servants ran for ladders; the monkey was seen\\n', 'by hundreds in the court, sitting upon the ridge of a building, holding\\n', 'me like a baby in one of his forepaws, and feeding me with the other, by\\n', 'cramming into my mouth some victuals he had squeezed out of the bag on\\n', 'one side of his chaps, and patting me when I would not eat; whereat many\\n', 'of the rabble below could not forbear laughing; neither do I think they\\n', 'justly ought to be blamed, for, without question, the sight was\\n', 'ridiculous enough to every body but myself.  Some of the people threw up\\n', 'stones, hoping to drive the monkey down; but this was strictly forbidden,\\n', 'or else, very probably, my brains had been dashed out.\\n', '\\n', 'The ladders were now applied, and mounted by several men; which the\\n', 'monkey observing, and finding himself almost encompassed, not being able\\n', 'to make speed enough with his three legs, let me drop on a ridge tile,\\n', 'and made his escape.  Here I sat for some time, five hundred yards from\\n', 'the ground, expecting every moment to be blown down by the wind, or to\\n', 'fall by my own giddiness, and come tumbling over and over from the ridge\\n', 'to the eaves; but an honest lad, one of my nurse’s footmen, climbed up,\\n', 'and putting me into his breeches pocket, brought me down safe.\\n', '\\n', 'I was almost choked with the filthy stuff the monkey had crammed down my\\n', 'throat: but my dear little nurse picked it out of my mouth with a small\\n', 'needle, and then I fell a-vomiting, which gave me great relief.  Yet I\\n', 'was so weak and bruised in the sides with the squeezes given me by this\\n', 'odious animal, that I was forced to keep my bed a fortnight.  The king,\\n', 'queen, and all the court, sent every day to inquire after my health; and\\n', 'her majesty made me several visits during my sickness.  The monkey was\\n', 'killed, and an order made, that no such animal should be kept about the\\n', 'palace.\\n', '\\n', 'When I attended the king after my recovery, to return him thanks for his\\n', 'favours, he was pleased to rally me a good deal upon this adventure.  He\\n', 'asked me, “what my thoughts and speculations were, while I lay in the\\n', 'monkey’s paw; how I liked the victuals he gave me; his manner of feeding;\\n', 'and whether the fresh air on the roof had sharpened my stomach.”  He\\n', 'desired to know, “what I would have done upon such an occasion in my own\\n', 'country.”  I told his majesty, “that in Europe we had no monkeys, except\\n', 'such as were brought for curiosity from other places, and so small, that\\n', 'I could deal with a dozen of them together, if they presumed to attack\\n', 'me.  And as for that monstrous animal with whom I was so lately engaged\\n', '(it was indeed as large as an elephant), if my fears had suffered me to\\n', 'think so far as to make use of my hanger,” (looking fiercely, and\\n', 'clapping my hand on the hilt, as I spoke) “when he poked his paw into my\\n', 'chamber, perhaps I should have given him such a wound, as would have made\\n', 'him glad to withdraw it with more haste than he put it in.”  This I\\n', 'delivered in a firm tone, like a person who was jealous lest his courage\\n', 'should be called in question.  However, my speech produced nothing else\\n', 'beside a laud laughter, which all the respect due to his majesty from\\n', 'those about him could not make them contain.  This made me reflect, how\\n', 'vain an attempt it is for a man to endeavour to do himself honour among\\n', 'those who are out of all degree of equality or comparison with him.  And\\n', 'yet I have seen the moral of my own behaviour very frequent in England\\n', 'since my return; where a little contemptible varlet, without the least\\n', 'title to birth, person, wit, or common sense, shall presume to look with\\n', 'importance, and put himself upon a foot with the greatest persons of the\\n', 'kingdom.\\n', '\\n', 'I was every day furnishing the court with some ridiculous story: and\\n', 'Glumdalclitch, although she loved me to excess, yet was arch enough to\\n', 'inform the queen, whenever I committed any folly that she thought would\\n', 'be diverting to her majesty.  The girl, who had been out of order, was\\n', 'carried by her governess to take the air about an hour’s distance, or\\n', 'thirty miles from town.  They alighted out of the coach near a small\\n', 'foot-path in a field, and Glumdalclitch setting down my travelling box, I\\n', 'went out of it to walk.  There was a cow-dung in the path, and I must\\n', 'need try my activity by attempting to leap over it.  I took a run, but\\n', 'unfortunately jumped short, and found myself just in the middle up to my\\n', 'knees.  I waded through with some difficulty, and one of the footmen\\n', 'wiped me as clean as he could with his handkerchief, for I was filthily\\n', 'bemired; and my nurse confined me to my box, till we returned home; where\\n', 'the queen was soon informed of what had passed, and the footmen spread it\\n', 'about the court: so that all the mirth for some days was at my expense.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER VI.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Several contrivances of the author to please the king and queen.  He\\n', 'shows his skill in music.  The king inquires into the state of England,\\n', 'which the author relates to him.  The king’s observations thereon.\\n', '\\n', 'I used to attend the king’s levee once or twice a week, and had often\\n', 'seen him under the barber’s hand, which indeed was at first very terrible\\n', 'to behold; for the razor was almost twice as long as an ordinary scythe.\\n', 'His majesty, according to the custom of the country, was only shaved\\n', 'twice a-week.  I once prevailed on the barber to give me some of the suds\\n', 'or lather, out of which I picked forty or fifty of the strongest stumps\\n', 'of hair.  I then took a piece of fine wood, and cut it like the back of a\\n', 'comb, making several holes in it at equal distances with as small a\\n', 'needle as I could get from Glumdalclitch.  I fixed in the stumps so\\n', 'artificially, scraping and sloping them with my knife toward the points,\\n', 'that I made a very tolerable comb; which was a seasonable supply, my own\\n', 'being so much broken in the teeth, that it was almost useless: neither\\n', 'did I know any artist in that country so nice and exact, as would\\n', 'undertake to make me another.\\n', '\\n', 'And this puts me in mind of an amusement, wherein I spent many of my\\n', 'leisure hours.  I desired the queen’s woman to save for me the combings\\n', 'of her majesty’s hair, whereof in time I got a good quantity; and\\n', 'consulting with my friend the cabinet-maker, who had received general\\n', 'orders to do little jobs for me, I directed him to make two chair-frames,\\n', 'no larger than those I had in my box, and to bore little holes with a\\n', 'fine awl, round those parts where I designed the backs and seats; through\\n', 'these holes I wove the strongest hairs I could pick out, just after the\\n', 'manner of cane chairs in England.  When they were finished, I made a\\n', 'present of them to her majesty; who kept them in her cabinet, and used to\\n', 'show them for curiosities, as indeed they were the wonder of every one\\n', 'that beheld them.  The queen would have me sit upon one of these chairs,\\n', 'but I absolutely refused to obey her, protesting I would rather die than\\n', 'place a dishonourable part of my body on those precious hairs, that once\\n', 'adorned her majesty’s head.  Of these hairs (as I had always a mechanical\\n', 'genius) I likewise made a neat little purse, about five feet long, with\\n', 'her majesty’s name deciphered in gold letters, which I gave to\\n', 'Glumdalclitch, by the queen’s consent.  To say the truth, it was more for\\n', 'show than use, being not of strength to bear the weight of the larger\\n', 'coins, and therefore she kept nothing in it but some little toys that\\n', 'girls are fond of.\\n', '\\n', 'The king, who delighted in music, had frequent concerts at court, to\\n', 'which I was sometimes carried, and set in my box on a table to hear them:\\n', 'but the noise was so great that I could hardly distinguish the tunes.  I\\n', 'am confident that all the drums and trumpets of a royal army, beating and\\n', 'sounding together just at your ears, could not equal it.  My practice was\\n', 'to have my box removed from the place where the performers sat, as far as\\n', 'I could, then to shut the doors and windows of it, and draw the window\\n', 'curtains; after which I found their music not disagreeable.\\n', '\\n', 'I had learned in my youth to play a little upon the spinet.\\n', 'Glumdalclitch kept one in her chamber, and a master attended twice a-week\\n', 'to teach her: I called it a spinet, because it somewhat resembled that\\n', 'instrument, and was played upon in the same manner.  A fancy came into my\\n', 'head, that I would entertain the king and queen with an English tune upon\\n', 'this instrument.  But this appeared extremely difficult: for the spinet\\n', 'was near sixty feet long, each key being almost a foot wide, so that with\\n', 'my arms extended I could not reach to above five keys, and to press them\\n', 'down required a good smart stroke with my fist, which would be too great\\n', 'a labour, and to no purpose.  The method I contrived was this: I prepared\\n', 'two round sticks, about the bigness of common cudgels; they were thicker\\n', 'at one end than the other, and I covered the thicker ends with pieces of\\n', 'a mouse’s skin, that by rapping on them I might neither damage the tops\\n', 'of the keys nor interrupt the sound.  Before the spinet a bench was\\n', 'placed, about four feet below the keys, and I was put upon the bench.  I\\n', 'ran sideling upon it, that way and this, as fast as I could, banging the\\n', 'proper keys with my two sticks, and made a shift to play a jig, to the\\n', 'great satisfaction of both their majesties; but it was the most violent\\n', 'exercise I ever underwent; and yet I could not strike above sixteen keys,\\n', 'nor consequently play the bass and treble together, as other artists do;\\n', 'which was a great disadvantage to my performance.\\n', '\\n', 'The king, who, as I before observed, was a prince of excellent\\n', 'understanding, would frequently order that I should be brought in my box,\\n', 'and set upon the table in his closet: he would then command me to bring\\n', 'one of my chairs out of the box, and sit down within three yards distance\\n', 'upon the top of the cabinet, which brought me almost to a level with his\\n', 'face.  In this manner I had several conversations with him.  I one day\\n', 'took the freedom to tell his majesty, “that the contempt he discovered\\n', 'towards Europe, and the rest of the world, did not seem answerable to\\n', 'those excellent qualities of mind that he was master of; that reason did\\n', 'not extend itself with the bulk of the body; on the contrary, we observed\\n', 'in our country, that the tallest persons were usually the least provided\\n', 'with it; that among other animals, bees and ants had the reputation of\\n', 'more industry, art, and sagacity, than many of the larger kinds; and\\n', 'that, as inconsiderable as he took me to be, I hoped I might live to do\\n', 'his majesty some signal service.”  The king heard me with attention, and\\n', 'began to conceive a much better opinion of me than he had ever before.\\n', 'He desired “I would give him as exact an account of the government of\\n', 'England as I possibly could; because, as fond as princes commonly are of\\n', 'their own customs (for so he conjectured of other monarchs, by my former\\n', 'discourses), he should be glad to hear of any thing that might deserve\\n', 'imitation.”\\n', '\\n', 'Imagine with thyself, courteous reader, how often I then wished for the\\n', 'tongue of Demosthenes or Cicero, that might have enabled me to celebrate\\n', 'the praise of my own dear native country in a style equal to its merits\\n', 'and felicity.\\n', '\\n', 'I began my discourse by informing his majesty, that our dominions\\n', 'consisted of two islands, which composed three mighty kingdoms, under one\\n', 'sovereign, beside our plantations in America.  I dwelt long upon the\\n', 'fertility of our soil, and the temperature of our climate.  I then spoke\\n', 'at large upon the constitution of an English parliament; partly made up\\n', 'of an illustrious body called the House of Peers; persons of the noblest\\n', 'blood, and of the most ancient and ample patrimonies.  I described that\\n', 'extraordinary care always taken of their education in arts and arms, to\\n', 'qualify them for being counsellors both to the king and kingdom; to have\\n', 'a share in the legislature; to be members of the highest court of\\n', 'judicature, whence there can be no appeal; and to be champions always\\n', 'ready for the defence of their prince and country, by their valour,\\n', 'conduct, and fidelity.  That these were the ornament and bulwark of the\\n', 'kingdom, worthy followers of their most renowned ancestors, whose honour\\n', 'had been the reward of their virtue, from which their posterity were\\n', 'never once known to degenerate.  To these were joined several holy\\n', 'persons, as part of that assembly, under the title of bishops, whose\\n', 'peculiar business is to take care of religion, and of those who instruct\\n', 'the people therein.  These were searched and sought out through the whole\\n', 'nation, by the prince and his wisest counsellors, among such of the\\n', 'priesthood as were most deservedly distinguished by the sanctity of their\\n', 'lives, and the depth of their erudition; who were indeed the spiritual\\n', 'fathers of the clergy and the people.\\n', '\\n', 'That the other part of the parliament consisted of an assembly called the\\n', 'House of Commons, who were all principal gentlemen, freely picked and\\n', 'culled out by the people themselves, for their great abilities and love\\n', 'of their country, to represent the wisdom of the whole nation.  And that\\n', 'these two bodies made up the most august assembly in Europe; to whom, in\\n', 'conjunction with the prince, the whole legislature is committed.\\n', '\\n', 'I then descended to the courts of justice; over which the judges, those\\n', 'venerable sages and interpreters of the law, presided, for determining\\n', 'the disputed rights and properties of men, as well as for the punishment\\n', 'of vice and protection of innocence.  I mentioned the prudent management\\n', 'of our treasury; the valour and achievements of our forces, by sea and\\n', 'land.  I computed the number of our people, by reckoning how many\\n', 'millions there might be of each religious sect, or political party among\\n', 'us.  I did not omit even our sports and pastimes, or any other particular\\n', 'which I thought might redound to the honour of my country.  And I\\n', 'finished all with a brief historical account of affairs and events in\\n', 'England for about a hundred years past.\\n', '\\n', 'This conversation was not ended under five audiences, each of several\\n', 'hours; and the king heard the whole with great attention, frequently\\n', 'taking notes of what I spoke, as well as memorandums of what questions he\\n', 'intended to ask me.\\n', '\\n', 'When I had put an end to these long discources, his majesty, in a sixth\\n', 'audience, consulting his notes, proposed many doubts, queries, and\\n', 'objections, upon every article.  He asked, “What methods were used to\\n', 'cultivate the minds and bodies of our young nobility, and in what kind of\\n', 'business they commonly spent the first and teachable parts of their\\n', 'lives?  What course was taken to supply that assembly, when any noble\\n', 'family became extinct?  What qualifications were necessary in those who\\n', 'are to be created new lords: whether the humour of the prince, a sum of\\n', 'money to a court lady, or a design of strengthening a party opposite to\\n', 'the public interest, ever happened to be the motive in those\\n', 'advancements?  What share of knowledge these lords had in the laws of\\n', 'their country, and how they came by it, so as to enable them to decide\\n', 'the properties of their fellow-subjects in the last resort?  Whether they\\n', 'were always so free from avarice, partialities, or want, that a bribe, or\\n', 'some other sinister view, could have no place among them?  Whether those\\n', 'holy lords I spoke of were always promoted to that rank upon account of\\n', 'their knowledge in religious matters, and the sanctity of their lives;\\n', 'had never been compliers with the times, while they were common priests;\\n', 'or slavish prostitute chaplains to some nobleman, whose opinions they\\n', 'continued servilely to follow, after they were admitted into that\\n', 'assembly?”\\n', '\\n', 'He then desired to know, “What arts were practised in electing those whom\\n', 'I called commoners: whether a stranger, with a strong purse, might not\\n', 'influence the vulgar voters to choose him before their own landlord, or\\n', 'the most considerable gentleman in the neighbourhood?  How it came to\\n', 'pass, that people were so violently bent upon getting into this assembly,\\n', 'which I allowed to be a great trouble and expense, often to the ruin of\\n', 'their families, without any salary or pension? because this appeared such\\n', 'an exalted strain of virtue and public spirit, that his majesty seemed to\\n', 'doubt it might possibly not be always sincere.”  And he desired to know,\\n', '“Whether such zealous gentlemen could have any views of refunding\\n', 'themselves for the charges and trouble they were at by sacrificing the\\n', 'public good to the designs of a weak and vicious prince, in conjunction\\n', 'with a corrupted ministry?”  He multiplied his questions, and sifted me\\n', 'thoroughly upon every part of this head, proposing numberless inquiries\\n', 'and objections, which I think it not prudent or convenient to repeat.\\n', '\\n', 'Upon what I said in relation to our courts of justice, his majesty\\n', 'desired to be satisfied in several points: and this I was the better able\\n', 'to do, having been formerly almost ruined by a long suit in chancery,\\n', 'which was decreed for me with costs.  He asked, “What time was usually\\n', 'spent in determining between right and wrong, and what degree of expense?\\n', 'Whether advocates and orators had liberty to plead in causes manifestly\\n', 'known to be unjust, vexatious, or oppressive?  Whether party, in religion\\n', 'or politics, were observed to be of any weight in the scale of justice?\\n', 'Whether those pleading orators were persons educated in the general\\n', 'knowledge of equity, or only in provincial, national, and other local\\n', 'customs?  Whether they or their judges had any part in penning those\\n', 'laws, which they assumed the liberty of interpreting, and glossing upon\\n', 'at their pleasure?  Whether they had ever, at different times, pleaded\\n', 'for and against the same cause, and cited precedents to prove contrary\\n', 'opinions?  Whether they were a rich or a poor corporation?  Whether they\\n', 'received any pecuniary reward for pleading, or delivering their opinions?\\n', 'And particularly, whether they were ever admitted as members in the lower\\n', 'senate?”\\n', '\\n', 'He fell next upon the management of our treasury; and said, “he thought\\n', 'my memory had failed me, because I computed our taxes at about five or\\n', 'six millions a-year, and when I came to mention the issues, he found they\\n', 'sometimes amounted to more than double; for the notes he had taken were\\n', 'very particular in this point, because he hoped, as he told me, that the\\n', 'knowledge of our conduct might be useful to him, and he could not be\\n', 'deceived in his calculations.  But, if what I told him were true, he was\\n', 'still at a loss how a kingdom could run out of its estate, like a private\\n', 'person.”  He asked me, “who were our creditors; and where we found money\\n', 'to pay them?”  He wondered to hear me talk of such chargeable and\\n', 'expensive wars; “that certainly we must be a quarrelsome people, or live\\n', 'among very bad neighbours, and that our generals must needs be richer\\n', 'than our kings.”  He asked, what business we had out of our own islands,\\n', 'unless upon the score of trade, or treaty, or to defend the coasts with\\n', 'our fleet?”  Above all, he was amazed to hear me talk of a mercenary\\n', 'standing army, in the midst of peace, and among a free people.  He said,\\n', '“if we were governed by our own consent, in the persons of our\\n', 'representatives, he could not imagine of whom we were afraid, or against\\n', 'whom we were to fight; and would hear my opinion, whether a private man’s\\n', 'house might not be better defended by himself, his children, and family,\\n', 'than by half-a-dozen rascals, picked up at a venture in the streets for\\n', 'small wages, who might get a hundred times more by cutting their\\n', 'throats?”\\n', '\\n', 'He laughed at my “odd kind of arithmetic,” as he was pleased to call it,\\n', '“in reckoning the numbers of our people, by a computation drawn from the\\n', 'several sects among us, in religion and politics.”  He said, “he knew no\\n', 'reason why those, who entertain opinions prejudicial to the public,\\n', 'should be obliged to change, or should not be obliged to conceal them.\\n', 'And as it was tyranny in any government to require the first, so it was\\n', 'weakness not to enforce the second: for a man may be allowed to keep\\n', 'poisons in his closet, but not to vend them about for cordials.”\\n', '\\n', 'He observed, “that among the diversions of our nobility and gentry, I had\\n', 'mentioned gaming: he desired to know at what age this entertainment was\\n', 'usually taken up, and when it was laid down; how much of their time it\\n', 'employed; whether it ever went so high as to affect their fortunes;\\n', 'whether mean, vicious people, by their dexterity in that art, might not\\n', 'arrive at great riches, and sometimes keep our very nobles in dependence,\\n', 'as well as habituate them to vile companions, wholly take them from the\\n', 'improvement of their minds, and force them, by the losses they received,\\n', 'to learn and practise that infamous dexterity upon others?”\\n', '\\n', 'He was perfectly astonished with the historical account gave him of our\\n', 'affairs during the last century; protesting “it was only a heap of\\n', 'conspiracies, rebellions, murders, massacres, revolutions, banishments,\\n', 'the very worst effects that avarice, faction, hypocrisy, perfidiousness,\\n', 'cruelty, rage, madness, hatred, envy, lust, malice, and ambition, could\\n', 'produce.”\\n', '\\n', 'His majesty, in another audience, was at the pains to recapitulate the\\n', 'sum of all I had spoken; compared the questions he made with the answers\\n', 'I had given; then taking me into his hands, and stroking me gently,\\n', 'delivered himself in these words, which I shall never forget, nor the\\n', 'manner he spoke them in: “My little friend Grildrig, you have made a most\\n', 'admirable panegyric upon your country; you have clearly proved, that\\n', 'ignorance, idleness, and vice, are the proper ingredients for qualifying\\n', 'a legislator; that laws are best explained, interpreted, and applied, by\\n', 'those whose interest and abilities lie in perverting, confounding, and\\n', 'eluding them.  I observe among you some lines of an institution, which,\\n', 'in its original, might have been tolerable, but these half erased, and\\n', 'the rest wholly blurred and blotted by corruptions.  It does not appear,\\n', 'from all you have said, how any one perfection is required toward the\\n', 'procurement of any one station among you; much less, that men are\\n', 'ennobled on account of their virtue; that priests are advanced for their\\n', 'piety or learning; soldiers, for their conduct or valour; judges, for\\n', 'their integrity; senators, for the love of their country; or counsellors\\n', 'for their wisdom.  As for yourself,” continued the king, “who have spent\\n', 'the greatest part of your life in travelling, I am well disposed to hope\\n', 'you may hitherto have escaped many vices of your country.  But by what I\\n', 'have gathered from your own relation, and the answers I have with much\\n', 'pains wrung and extorted from you, I cannot but conclude the bulk of your\\n', 'natives to be the most pernicious race of little odious vermin that\\n', 'nature ever suffered to crawl upon the surface of the earth.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER VII.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The author’s love of his country.  He makes a proposal of much advantage\\n', 'to the king, which is rejected.  The king’s great ignorance in politics.\\n', 'The learning of that country very imperfect and confined.  The laws, and\\n', 'military affairs, and parties in the state.\\n', '\\n', 'Nothing but an extreme love of truth could have hindered me from\\n', 'concealing this part of my story.  It was in vain to discover my\\n', 'resentments, which were always turned into ridicule; and I was forced to\\n', 'rest with patience, while my noble and beloved country was so injuriously\\n', 'treated.  I am as heartily sorry as any of my readers can possibly be,\\n', 'that such an occasion was given: but this prince happened to be so\\n', 'curious and inquisitive upon every particular, that it could not consist\\n', 'either with gratitude or good manners, to refuse giving him what\\n', 'satisfaction I was able.  Yet thus much I may be allowed to say in my own\\n', 'vindication, that I artfully eluded many of his questions, and gave to\\n', 'every point a more favourable turn, by many degrees, than the strictness\\n', 'of truth would allow.  For I have always borne that laudable partiality\\n', 'to my own country, which Dionysius Halicarnassensis, with so much\\n', 'justice, recommends to an historian: I would hide the frailties and\\n', 'deformities of my political mother, and place her virtues and beauties in\\n', 'the most advantageous light.  This was my sincere endeavour in those many\\n', 'discourses I had with that monarch, although it unfortunately failed of\\n', 'success.\\n', '\\n', 'But great allowances should be given to a king, who lives wholly secluded\\n', 'from the rest of the world, and must therefore be altogether unacquainted\\n', 'with the manners and customs that most prevail in other nations: the want\\n', 'of which knowledge will ever produce many prejudices, and a certain\\n', 'narrowness of thinking, from which we, and the politer countries of\\n', 'Europe, are wholly exempted.  And it would be hard indeed, if so remote a\\n', 'prince’s notions of virtue and vice were to be offered as a standard for\\n', 'all mankind.\\n', '\\n', 'To confirm what I have now said, and further to show the miserable\\n', 'effects of a confined education, I shall here insert a passage, which\\n', 'will hardly obtain belief.  In hopes to ingratiate myself further into\\n', 'his majesty’s favour, I told him of “an invention, discovered between\\n', 'three and four hundred years ago, to make a certain powder, into a heap\\n', 'of which, the smallest spark of fire falling, would kindle the whole in a\\n', 'moment, although it were as big as a mountain, and make it all fly up in\\n', 'the air together, with a noise and agitation greater than thunder.  That\\n', 'a proper quantity of this powder rammed into a hollow tube of brass or\\n', 'iron, according to its bigness, would drive a ball of iron or lead, with\\n', 'such violence and speed, as nothing was able to sustain its force.  That\\n', 'the largest balls thus discharged, would not only destroy whole ranks of\\n', 'an army at once, but batter the strongest walls to the ground, sink down\\n', 'ships, with a thousand men in each, to the bottom of the sea, and when\\n', 'linked together by a chain, would cut through masts and rigging, divide\\n', 'hundreds of bodies in the middle, and lay all waste before them.  That we\\n', 'often put this powder into large hollow balls of iron, and discharged\\n', 'them by an engine into some city we were besieging, which would rip up\\n', 'the pavements, tear the houses to pieces, burst and throw splinters on\\n', 'every side, dashing out the brains of all who came near.  That I knew the\\n', 'ingredients very well, which were cheap and common; I understood the\\n', 'manner of compounding them, and could direct his workmen how to make\\n', 'those tubes, of a size proportionable to all other things in his\\n', 'majesty’s kingdom, and the largest need not be above a hundred feet long;\\n', 'twenty or thirty of which tubes, charged with the proper quantity of\\n', 'powder and balls, would batter down the walls of the strongest town in\\n', 'his dominions in a few hours, or destroy the whole metropolis, if ever it\\n', 'should pretend to dispute his absolute commands.”  This I humbly offered\\n', 'to his majesty, as a small tribute of acknowledgment, in turn for so many\\n', 'marks that I had received, of his royal favour and protection.\\n', '\\n', 'The king was struck with horror at the description I had given of those\\n', 'terrible engines, and the proposal I had made.  “He was amazed, how so\\n', 'impotent and grovelling an insect as I” (these were his expressions)\\n', '“could entertain such inhuman ideas, and in so familiar a manner, as to\\n', 'appear wholly unmoved at all the scenes of blood and desolation which I\\n', 'had painted as the common effects of those destructive machines;\\n', 'whereof,” he said, “some evil genius, enemy to mankind, must have been\\n', 'the first contriver.  As for himself, he protested, that although few\\n', 'things delighted him so much as new discoveries in art or in nature, yet\\n', 'he would rather lose half his kingdom, than be privy to such a secret;\\n', 'which he commanded me, as I valued any life, never to mention any more.”\\n', '\\n', 'A strange effect of narrow principles and views! that a prince possessed\\n', 'of every quality which procures veneration, love, and esteem; of strong\\n', 'parts, great wisdom, and profound learning, endowed with admirable\\n', 'talents, and almost adored by his subjects, should, from a nice,\\n', 'unnecessary scruple, whereof in Europe we can have no conception, let\\n', 'slip an opportunity put into his hands that would have made him absolute\\n', 'master of the lives, the liberties, and the fortunes of his people!\\n', 'Neither do I say this, with the least intention to detract from the many\\n', 'virtues of that excellent king, whose character, I am sensible, will, on\\n', 'this account, be very much lessened in the opinion of an English reader:\\n', 'but I take this defect among them to have risen from their ignorance, by\\n', 'not having hitherto reduced politics into a science, as the more acute\\n', 'wits of Europe have done.  For, I remember very well, in a discourse one\\n', 'day with the king, when I happened to say, “there were several thousand\\n', 'books among us written upon the art of government,” it gave him (directly\\n', 'contrary to my intention) a very mean opinion of our understandings.  He\\n', 'professed both to abominate and despise all mystery, refinement, and\\n', 'intrigue, either in a prince or a minister.  He could not tell what I\\n', 'meant by secrets of state, where an enemy, or some rival nation, were not\\n', 'in the case.  He confined the knowledge of governing within very narrow\\n', 'bounds, to common sense and reason, to justice and lenity, to the speedy\\n', 'determination of civil and criminal causes; with some other obvious\\n', 'topics, which are not worth considering.  And he gave it for his opinion,\\n', '“that whoever could make two ears of corn, or two blades of grass, to\\n', 'grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before, would deserve\\n', 'better of mankind, and do more essential service to his country, than the\\n', 'whole race of politicians put together.”\\n', '\\n', 'The learning of this people is very defective, consisting only in\\n', 'morality, history, poetry, and mathematics, wherein they must be allowed\\n', 'to excel.  But the last of these is wholly applied to what may be useful\\n', 'in life, to the improvement of agriculture, and all mechanical arts; so\\n', 'that among us, it would be little esteemed.  And as to ideas, entities,\\n', 'abstractions, and transcendentals, I could never drive the least\\n', 'conception into their heads.\\n', '\\n', 'No law in that country must exceed in words the number of letters in\\n', 'their alphabet, which consists only of two and twenty.  But indeed few of\\n', 'them extend even to that length.  They are expressed in the most plain\\n', 'and simple terms, wherein those people are not mercurial enough to\\n', 'discover above one interpretation: and to write a comment upon any law,\\n', 'is a capital crime.  As to the decision of civil causes, or proceedings\\n', 'against criminals, their precedents are so few, that they have little\\n', 'reason to boast of any extraordinary skill in either.\\n', '\\n', 'They have had the art of printing, as well as the Chinese, time out of\\n', 'mind: but their libraries are not very large; for that of the king, which\\n', 'is reckoned the largest, does not amount to above a thousand volumes,\\n', 'placed in a gallery of twelve hundred feet long, whence I had liberty to\\n', 'borrow what books I pleased.  The queen’s joiner had contrived in one of\\n', 'Glumdalclitch’s rooms, a kind of wooden machine five-and-twenty feet\\n', 'high, formed like a standing ladder; the steps were each fifty feet long.\\n', 'It was indeed a moveable pair of stairs, the lowest end placed at ten\\n', 'feet distance from the wall of the chamber.  The book I had a mind to\\n', 'read, was put up leaning against the wall: I first mounted to the upper\\n', 'step of the ladder, and turning my face towards the book, began at the\\n', 'top of the page, and so walking to the right and left about eight or ten\\n', 'paces, according to the length of the lines, till I had gotten a little\\n', 'below the level of mine eyes, and then descending gradually till I came\\n', 'to the bottom: after which I mounted again, and began the other page in\\n', 'the same manner, and so turned over the leaf, which I could easily do\\n', 'with both my hands, for it was as thick and stiff as a pasteboard, and in\\n', 'the largest folios not above eighteen or twenty feet long.\\n', '\\n', 'Their style is clear, masculine, and smooth, but not florid; for they\\n', 'avoid nothing more than multiplying unnecessary words, or using various\\n', 'expressions.  I have perused many of their books, especially those in\\n', 'history and morality.  Among the rest, I was much diverted with a little\\n', 'old treatise, which always lay in Glumdalclitch’s bed chamber, and\\n', 'belonged to her governess, a grave elderly gentlewoman, who dealt in\\n', 'writings of morality and devotion.  The book treats of the weakness of\\n', 'human kind, and is in little esteem, except among the women and the\\n', 'vulgar.  However, I was curious to see what an author of that country\\n', 'could say upon such a subject.  This writer went through all the usual\\n', 'topics of European moralists, showing “how diminutive, contemptible, and\\n', 'helpless an animal was man in his own nature; how unable to defend\\n', 'himself from inclemencies of the air, or the fury of wild beasts: how\\n', 'much he was excelled by one creature in strength, by another in speed, by\\n', 'a third in foresight, by a fourth in industry.”  He added, “that nature\\n', 'was degenerated in these latter declining ages of the world, and could\\n', 'now produce only small abortive births, in comparison of those in ancient\\n', 'times.”  He said “it was very reasonable to think, not only that the\\n', 'species of men were originally much larger, but also that there must have\\n', 'been giants in former ages; which, as it is asserted by history and\\n', 'tradition, so it has been confirmed by huge bones and skulls, casually\\n', 'dug up in several parts of the kingdom, far exceeding the common dwindled\\n', 'race of men in our days.”  He argued, “that the very laws of nature\\n', 'absolutely required we should have been made, in the beginning of a size\\n', 'more large and robust; not so liable to destruction from every little\\n', 'accident, of a tile falling from a house, or a stone cast from the hand\\n', 'of a boy, or being drowned in a little brook.”  From this way of\\n', 'reasoning, the author drew several moral applications, useful in the\\n', 'conduct of life, but needless here to repeat.  For my own part, I could\\n', 'not avoid reflecting how universally this talent was spread, of drawing\\n', 'lectures in morality, or indeed rather matter of discontent and repining,\\n', 'from the quarrels we raise with nature.  And I believe, upon a strict\\n', 'inquiry, those quarrels might be shown as ill-grounded among us as they\\n', 'are among that people.\\n', '\\n', 'As to their military affairs, they boast that the king’s army consists of\\n', 'a hundred and seventy-six thousand foot, and thirty-two thousand horse:\\n', 'if that may be called an army, which is made up of tradesmen in the\\n', 'several cities, and farmers in the country, whose commanders are only the\\n', 'nobility and gentry, without pay or reward.  They are indeed perfect\\n', 'enough in their exercises, and under very good discipline, wherein I saw\\n', 'no great merit; for how should it be otherwise, where every farmer is\\n', 'under the command of his own landlord, and every citizen under that of\\n', 'the principal men in his own city, chosen after the manner of Venice, by\\n', 'ballot?\\n', '\\n', 'I have often seen the militia of Lorbrulgrud drawn out to exercise, in a\\n', 'great field near the city of twenty miles square.  They were in all not\\n', 'above twenty-five thousand foot, and six thousand horse; but it was\\n', 'impossible for me to compute their number, considering the space of\\n', 'ground they took up.  A cavalier, mounted on a large steed, might be\\n', 'about ninety feet high.  I have seen this whole body of horse, upon a\\n', 'word of command, draw their swords at once, and brandish them in the air.\\n', 'Imagination can figure nothing so grand, so surprising, and so\\n', 'astonishing! it looked as if ten thousand flashes of lightning were\\n', 'darting at the same time from every quarter of the sky.\\n', '\\n', 'I was curious to know how this prince, to whose dominions there is no\\n', 'access from any other country, came to think of armies, or to teach his\\n', 'people the practice of military discipline.  But I was soon informed,\\n', 'both by conversation and reading their histories; for, in the course of\\n', 'many ages, they have been troubled with the same disease to which the\\n', 'whole race of mankind is subject; the nobility often contending for\\n', 'power, the people for liberty, and the king for absolute dominion.  All\\n', 'which, however happily tempered by the laws of that kingdom, have been\\n', 'sometimes violated by each of the three parties, and have more than once\\n', 'occasioned civil wars; the last whereof was happily put an end to by this\\n', 'prince’s grand-father, in a general composition; and the militia, then\\n', 'settled with common consent, has been ever since kept in the strictest\\n', 'duty.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER VIII.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The king and queen make a progress to the frontiers.

The ship in which I sailed,\\n', 'was the first ever known to be driven within sight of that coast, and the\\n', 'king had given strict orders, that if at any time another appeared, it\\n', 'should be taken ashore, and with all its crew and passengers brought in a\\n', 'tumbril to Lorbrulgrud.  He was strongly bent to get me a woman of my own\\n', 'size, by whom I might propagate the breed: but I think I should rather\\n', 'have died than undergone the disgrace of leaving a posterity to be kept\\n', 'in cages, like tame canary-birds, and perhaps, in time, sold about the\\n', 'kingdom, to persons of quality, for curiosities.  I was indeed treated\\n', 'with much kindness: I was the favourite of a great king and queen, and\\n', 'the delight of the whole court; but it was upon such a foot as ill became\\n', 'the dignity of humankind.  I could never forget those domestic pledges I\\n', 'had left behind me.  I wanted to be among people, with whom I could\\n', 'converse upon even terms, and walk about the streets and fields without\\n', 'being afraid of being trod to death like a frog or a young puppy.  But my\\n', 'deliverance came sooner than I expected, and in a manner not very common;\\n', 'the whole story and circumstances of which I shall faithfully relate.\\n', '\\n', 'I had now been two years in this country; and about the beginning of the\\n', 'third, Glumdalclitch and I attended the king and queen, in a progress to\\n', 'the south coast of the kingdom.  I was carried, as usual, in my\\n', 'travelling-box, which as I have already described, was a very convenient\\n', 'closet, of twelve feet wide.  And I had ordered a hammock to be fixed, by\\n', 'silken ropes from the four corners at the top, to break the jolts, when a\\n', 'servant carried me before him on horseback, as I sometimes desired; and\\n', 'would often sleep in my hammock, while we were upon the road.  On the\\n', 'roof of my closet, not directly over the middle of the hammock, I ordered\\n', 'the joiner to cut out a hole of a foot square, to give me air in hot\\n', 'weather, as I slept; which hole I shut at pleasure with a board that drew\\n', 'backward and forward through a groove.\\n', '\\n', 'When we came to our journey’s end, the king thought proper to pass a few\\n', 'days at a palace he has near Flanflasnic, a city within eighteen English\\n', 'miles of the seaside.  Glumdalclitch and I were much fatigued: I had\\n', 'gotten a small cold, but the poor girl was so ill as to be confined to\\n', 'her chamber.  I longed to see the ocean, which must be the only scene of\\n', 'my escape, if ever it should happen.  I pretended to be worse than I\\n', 'really was, and desired leave to take the fresh air of the sea, with a\\n', 'page, whom I was very fond of, and who had sometimes been trusted with\\n', 'me.  I shall never forget with what unwillingness Glumdalclitch\\n', 'consented, nor the strict charge she gave the page to be careful of me,\\n', 'bursting at the same time into a flood of tears, as if she had some\\n', 'forboding of what was to happen.  The boy took me out in my box, about\\n', 'half an hours walk from the palace, towards the rocks on the sea-shore.\\n', 'I ordered him to set me down, and lifting up one of my sashes, cast many\\n', 'a wistful melancholy look towards the sea.  I found myself not very well,\\n', 'and told the page that I had a mind to take a nap in my hammock, which I\\n', 'hoped would do me good.  I got in, and the boy shut the window close\\n', 'down, to keep out the cold.  I soon fell asleep, and all I can conjecture\\n', 'is, while I slept, the page, thinking no danger could happen, went among\\n', 'the rocks to look for birds’ eggs, having before observed him from my\\n', 'window searching about, and picking up one or two in the clefts.  Be that\\n', 'as it will, I found myself suddenly awaked with a violent pull upon the\\n', 'ring, which was fastened at the top of my box for the conveniency of\\n', 'carriage.  I felt my box raised very high in the air, and then borne\\n', 'forward with prodigious speed.  The first jolt had like to have shaken me\\n', 'out of my hammock, but afterward the motion was easy enough.  I called\\n', 'out several times, as loud as I could raise my voice, but all to no\\n', 'purpose.  I looked towards my windows, and could see nothing but the\\n', 'clouds and sky.  I heard a noise just over my head, like the clapping of\\n', 'wings, and then began to perceive the woful condition I was in; that some\\n', 'eagle had got the ring of my box in his beak, with an intent to let it\\n', 'fall on a rock, like a tortoise in a shell, and then pick out my body,\\n', 'and devour it: for the sagacity and smell of this bird enables him to\\n', 'discover his quarry at a great distance, though better concealed than I\\n', 'could be within a two-inch board.\\n', '\\n', 'In a little time, I observed the noise and flutter of wings to increase\\n', 'very fast, and my box was tossed up and down, like a sign in a windy day.\\n', 'I heard several bangs or buffets, as I thought given to the eagle (for\\n', 'such I am certain it must have been that held the ring of my box in his\\n', 'beak), and then, all on a sudden, felt myself falling perpendicularly\\n', 'down, for above a minute, but with such incredible swiftness, that I\\n', 'almost lost my breath.  My fall was stopped by a terrible squash, that\\n', 'sounded louder to my ears than the cataract of Niagara; after which, I\\n', 'was quite in the dark for another minute, and then my box began to rise\\n', 'so high, that I could see light from the tops of the windows.  I now\\n', 'perceived I was fallen into the sea.  My box, by the weight of my body,\\n', 'the goods that were in, and the broad plates of iron fixed for strength\\n', 'at the four corners of the top and bottom, floated about five feet deep\\n', 'in water.  I did then, and do now suppose, that the eagle which flew away\\n', 'with my box was pursued by two or three others, and forced to let me\\n', 'drop, while he defended himself against the rest, who hoped to share in\\n', 'the prey.  The plates of iron fastened at the bottom of the box (for\\n', 'those were the strongest) preserved the balance while it fell, and\\n', 'hindered it from being broken on the surface of the water. Every joint of\\n', 'it was well grooved; and the door did not move on hinges, but up and down\\n', 'like a sash, which kept my closet so tight that very little water came\\n', 'in.  I got with much difficulty out of my hammock, having first ventured\\n', 'to draw back the slip-board on the roof already mentioned, contrived on\\n', 'purpose to let in air, for want of which I found myself almost stifled.\\n', '\\n', 'How often did I then wish myself with my dear Glumdalclitch, from whom\\n', 'one single hour had so far divided me!  And I may say with truth, that in\\n', 'the midst of my own misfortunes I could not forbear lamenting my poor\\n', 'nurse, the grief she would suffer for my loss, the displeasure of the\\n', 'queen, and the ruin of her fortune.  Perhaps many travellers have not\\n', 'been under greater difficulties and distress than I was at this juncture,\\n', 'expecting every moment to see my box dashed to pieces, or at least\\n', 'overset by the first violent blast, or rising wave.  A breach in one\\n', 'single pane of glass would have been immediate death: nor could any thing\\n', 'have preserved the windows, but the strong lattice wires placed on the\\n', 'outside, against accidents in travelling.  I saw the water ooze in at\\n', 'several crannies, although the leaks were not considerable, and I\\n', 'endeavoured to stop them as well as I could.  I was not able to lift up\\n', 'the roof of my closet, which otherwise I certainly should have done, and\\n', 'sat on the top of it; where I might at least preserve myself some hours\\n', 'longer, than by being shut up (as I may call it) in the hold.  Or if I\\n', 'escaped these dangers for a day or two, what could I expect but a\\n', 'miserable death of cold and hunger?  I was four hours under these\\n', 'circumstances, expecting, and indeed wishing, every moment to be my last.\\n', '\\n', 'I have already told the reader that there were two strong staples fixed\\n', 'upon that side of my box which had no window, and into which the servant,\\n', 'who used to carry me on horseback, would put a leathern belt, and buckle\\n', 'it about his waist.  Being in this disconsolate state, I heard, or at\\n', 'least thought I heard, some kind of grating noise on that side of my box\\n', 'where the staples were fixed; and soon after I began to fancy that the\\n', 'box was pulled or towed along the sea; for I now and then felt a sort of\\n', 'tugging, which made the waves rise near the tops of my windows, leaving\\n', 'me almost in the dark.  This gave me some faint hopes of relief, although\\n', 'I was not able to imagine how it could be brought about.  I ventured to\\n', 'unscrew one of my chairs, which were always fastened to the floor; and\\n', 'having made a hard shift to screw it down again, directly under the\\n', 'slipping-board that I had lately opened, I mounted on the chair, and\\n', 'putting my mouth as near as I could to the hole, I called for help in a\\n', 'loud voice, and in all the languages I understood.  I then fastened my\\n', 'handkerchief to a stick I usually carried, and thrusting it up the hole,\\n', 'waved it several times in the air, that if any boat or ship were near,\\n', 'the seamen might conjecture some unhappy mortal to be shut up in the box.\\n', '\\n', 'I found no effect from all I could do, but plainly perceived my closet to\\n', 'be moved along; and in the space of an hour, or better, that side of the\\n', 'box where the staples were, and had no windows, struck against something\\n', 'that was hard.  I apprehended it to be a rock, and found myself tossed\\n', 'more than ever.  I plainly heard a noise upon the cover of my closet,\\n', 'like that of a cable, and the grating of it as it passed through the\\n', 'ring.  I then found myself hoisted up, by degrees, at least three feet\\n', 'higher than I was before.  Whereupon I again thrust up my stick and\\n', 'handkerchief, calling for help till I was almost hoarse.  In return to\\n', 'which, I heard a great shout repeated three times, giving me such\\n', 'transports of joy as are not to be conceived but by those who feel them.\\n', 'I now heard a trampling over my head, and somebody calling through the\\n', 'hole with a loud voice, in the English tongue, “If there be any body\\n', 'below, let them speak.”  I answered, “I was an Englishman, drawn by ill\\n', 'fortune into the greatest calamity that ever any creature underwent, and\\n', 'begged, by all that was moving, to be delivered out of the dungeon I was\\n', 'in.”  The voice replied, “I was safe, for my box was fastened to their\\n', 'ship; and the carpenter should immediately come and saw a hole in the\\n', 'cover, large enough to pull me out.”  I answered, “that was needless, and\\n', 'would take up too much time; for there was no more to be done, but let\\n', 'one of the crew put his finger into the ring, and take the box out of the\\n', 'sea into the ship, and so into the captain’s cabin.”  Some of them, upon\\n', 'hearing me talk so wildly, thought I was mad: others laughed; for indeed\\n', 'it never came into my head, that I was now got among people of my own\\n', 'stature and strength.  The carpenter came, and in a few minutes sawed a\\n', 'passage about four feet square, then let down a small ladder, upon which\\n', 'I mounted, and thence was taken into the ship in a very weak condition.\\n', '\\n', 'The sailors were all in amazement, and asked me a thousand questions,\\n', 'which I had no inclination to answer.  I was equally confounded at the\\n', 'sight of so many pigmies, for such I took them to be, after having so\\n', 'long accustomed mine eyes to the monstrous objects I had left.  But the\\n', 'captain, Mr. Thomas Wilcocks, an honest worthy Shropshire man, observing\\n', 'I was ready to faint, took me into his cabin, gave me a cordial to\\n', 'comfort me, and made me turn in upon his own bed, advising me to take a\\n', 'little rest, of which I had great need.  Before I went to sleep, I gave\\n', 'him to understand that I had some valuable furniture in my box, too good\\n', 'to be lost: a fine hammock, a handsome field-bed, two chairs, a table,\\n', 'and a cabinet; that my closet was hung on all sides, or rather quilted,\\n', 'with silk and cotton; that if he would let one of the crew bring my\\n', 'closet into his cabin, I would open it there before him, and show him my\\n', 'goods.  The captain, hearing me utter these absurdities, concluded I was\\n', 'raving; however (I suppose to pacify me) he promised to give order as I\\n', 'desired, and going upon deck, sent some of his men down into my closet,\\n', 'whence (as I afterwards found) they drew up all my goods, and stripped\\n', 'off the quilting; but the chairs, cabinet, and bedstead, being screwed to\\n', 'the floor, were much damaged by the ignorance of the seamen, who tore\\n', 'them up by force.  Then they knocked off some of the boards for the use\\n', 'of the ship, and when they had got all they had a mind for, let the hull\\n', 'drop into the sea, which by reason of many breaches made in the bottom\\n', 'and sides, sunk to rights.  And, indeed, I was glad not to have been a\\n', 'spectator of the havoc they made, because I am confident it would have\\n', 'sensibly touched me, by bringing former passages into my mind, which I\\n', 'would rather have forgot.\\n', '\\n', 'I slept some hours, but perpetually disturbed with dreams of the place I\\n', 'had left, and the dangers I had escaped.  However, upon waking, I found\\n', 'myself much recovered.  It was now about eight o’clock at night, and the\\n', 'captain ordered supper immediately, thinking I had already fasted too\\n', 'long.  He entertained me with great kindness, observing me not to look\\n', 'wildly, or talk inconsistently: and, when we were left alone, desired I\\n', 'would give him a relation of my travels, and by what accident I came to\\n', 'be set adrift, in that monstrous wooden chest.  He said “that about\\n', 'twelve o’clock at noon, as he was looking through his glass, he spied it\\n', 'at a distance, and thought it was a sail, which he had a mind to make,\\n', 'being not much out of his course, in hopes of buying some biscuit, his\\n', 'own beginning to fall short.  That upon coming nearer, and finding his\\n', 'error, he sent out his long-boat to discover what it was; that his men\\n', 'came back in a fright, swearing they had seen a swimming house.  That he\\n', 'laughed at their folly, and went himself in the boat, ordering his men to\\n', 'take a strong cable along with them.  That the weather being calm, he\\n', 'rowed round me several times, observed my windows and wire lattices that\\n', 'defended them.  That he discovered two staples upon one side, which was\\n', 'all of boards, without any passage for light.  He then commanded his men\\n', 'to row up to that side, and fastening a cable to one of the staples,\\n', 'ordered them to tow my chest, as they called it, toward the ship.  When\\n', 'it was there, he gave directions to fasten another cable to the ring\\n', 'fixed in the cover, and to raise up my chest with pulleys, which all the\\n', 'sailors were not able to do above two or three feet.”  He said, “they saw\\n', 'my stick and handkerchief thrust out of the hole, and concluded that some\\n', 'unhappy man must be shut up in the cavity.”  I asked, “whether he or the\\n', 'crew had seen any prodigious birds in the air, about the time he first\\n', 'discovered me.”  To which he answered, “that discoursing this matter with\\n', 'the sailors while I was asleep, one of them said, he had observed three\\n', 'eagles flying towards the north, but remarked nothing of their being\\n', 'larger than the usual size:” which I suppose must be imputed to the great\\n', 'height they were at; and he could not guess the reason of my question.  I\\n', 'then asked the captain, “how far he reckoned we might be from land?”  He\\n', 'said, “by the best computation he could make, we were at least a hundred\\n', 'leagues.”  I assured him, “that he must be mistaken by almost half, for I\\n', 'had not left the country whence I came above two hours before I dropped\\n', 'into the sea.”  Whereupon he began again to think that my brain was\\n', 'disturbed, of which he gave me a hint, and advised me to go to bed in a\\n', 'cabin he had provided.  I assured him, “I was well refreshed with his\\n', 'good entertainment and company, and as much in my senses as ever I was in\\n', 'my life.”  He then grew serious, and desired to ask me freely, “whether I\\n', 'were not troubled in my mind by the consciousness of some enormous crime,\\n', 'for which I was punished, at the command of some prince, by exposing me\\n', 'in that chest; as great criminals, in other countries, have been forced\\n', 'to sea in a leaky vessel, without provisions: for although he should be\\n', 'sorry to have taken so ill a man into his ship, yet he would engage his\\n', 'word to set me safe ashore, in the first port where we arrived.”  He\\n', 'added, “that his suspicions were much increased by some very absurd\\n', 'speeches I had delivered at first to his sailors, and afterwards to\\n', 'himself, in relation to my closet or chest, as well as by my odd looks\\n', 'and behaviour while I was at supper.”\\n', '\\n', 'I begged his patience to hear me tell my story, which I faithfully did,\\n', 'from the last time I left England, to the moment he first discovered me.\\n', 'And, as truth always forces its way into rational minds, so this honest\\n', 'worthy gentleman, who had some tincture of learning, and very good sense,\\n', 'was immediately convinced of my candour and veracity.  But further to\\n', 'confirm all I had said, I entreated him to give order that my cabinet\\n', 'should be brought, of which I had the key in my pocket; for he had\\n', 'already informed me how the seamen disposed of my closet.  I opened it in\\n', 'his own presence, and showed him the small collection of rarities I made\\n', 'in the country from which I had been so strangely delivered.  There was\\n', 'the comb I had contrived out of the stumps of the king’s beard, and\\n', 'another of the same materials, but fixed into a paring of her majesty’s\\n', 'thumb-nail, which served for the back.  There was a collection of needles\\n', 'and pins, from a foot to half a yard long; four wasp stings, like\\n', 'joiner’s tacks; some combings of the queen’s hair; a gold ring, which one\\n', 'day she made me a present of, in a most obliging manner, taking it from\\n', 'her little finger, and throwing it over my head like a collar.  I desired\\n', 'the captain would please to accept this ring in return for his\\n', 'civilities; which he absolutely refused.  I showed him a corn that I had\\n', 'cut off with my own hand, from a maid of honour’s toe; it was about the\\n', 'bigness of Kentish pippin, and grown so hard, that when I returned\\n', 'England, I got it hollowed into a cup, and set in silver.  Lastly, I\\n', 'desired him to see the breeches I had then on, which were made of a\\n', 'mouse’s skin.\\n', '\\n', 'I could force nothing on him but a footman’s tooth, which I observed him\\n', 'to examine with great curiosity, and found he had a fancy for it.  He\\n', 'received it with abundance of thanks, more than such a trifle could\\n', 'deserve.  It was drawn by an unskilful surgeon, in a mistake, from one of\\n', 'Glumdalclitch’s men, who was afflicted with the tooth-ache, but it was as\\n', 'sound as any in his head.  I got it cleaned, and put it into my cabinet.\\n', 'It was about a foot long, and four inches in diameter.\\n', '\\n', 'The captain was very well satisfied with this plain relation I had given\\n', 'him, and said, “he hoped, when we returned to England, I would oblige the\\n', 'world by putting it on paper, and making it public.”  My answer was,\\n', '“that we were overstocked with books of travels: that nothing could now\\n', 'pass which was not extraordinary; wherein I doubted some authors less\\n', 'consulted truth, than their own vanity, or interest, or the diversion of\\n', 'ignorant readers; that my story could contain little beside common\\n', 'events, without those ornamental descriptions of strange plants, trees,\\n', 'birds, and other animals; or of the barbarous customs and idolatry of\\n', 'savage people, with which most writers abound.  However, I thanked him\\n', 'for his good opinion, and promised to take the matter into my thoughts.”\\n', '\\n', 'He said “he wondered at one thing very much, which was, to hear me speak\\n', 'so loud;” asking me “whether the king or queen of that country were thick\\n', 'of hearing?”  I told him, “it was what I had been used to for above two\\n', 'years past, and that I admired as much at the voices of him and his men,\\n', 'who seemed to me only to whisper, and yet I could hear them well enough.\\n', 'But, when I spoke in that country, it was like a man talking in the\\n', 'streets, to another looking out from the top of a steeple, unless when I\\n', 'was placed on a table, or held in any person’s hand.”  I told him, “I had\\n', 'likewise observed another thing, that, when I first got into the ship,\\n', 'and the sailors stood all about me, I thought they were the most little\\n', 'contemptible creatures I had ever beheld.”  For indeed, while I was in\\n', 'that prince’s country, I could never endure to look in a glass, after\\n', 'mine eyes had been accustomed to such prodigious objects, because the\\n', 'comparison gave me so despicable a conceit of myself.  The captain said,\\n', '“that while we were at supper, he observed me to look at every thing with\\n', 'a sort of wonder, and that I often seemed hardly able to contain my\\n', 'laughter, which he knew not well how to take, but imputed it to some\\n', 'disorder in my brain.”  I answered, “it was very true; and I wondered how\\n', 'I could forbear, when I saw his dishes of the size of a silver\\n', 'three-pence, a leg of pork hardly a mouthful, a cup not so big as a\\n', 'nut-shell;” and so I went on, describing the rest of his household-stuff\\n', 'and provisions, after the same manner.  For, although he queen had\\n', 'ordered a little equipage of all things necessary for me, while I was in\\n', 'her service, yet my ideas were wholly taken up with what I saw on every\\n', 'side of me, and I winked at my own littleness, as people do at their own\\n', 'faults.  The captain understood my raillery very well, and merrily\\n', 'replied with the old English proverb, “that he doubted mine eyes were\\n', 'bigger than my belly, for he did not observe my stomach so good, although\\n', 'I had fasted all day;” and, continuing in his mirth, protested “he would\\n', 'have gladly given a hundred pounds, to have seen my closet in the eagle’s\\n', 'bill, and afterwards in its fall from so great a height into the sea;\\n', 'which would certainly have been a most astonishing object, worthy to have\\n', 'the description of it transmitted to future ages:” and the comparison of\\n', 'Phaëton was so obvious, that he could not forbear applying it, although I\\n', 'did not much admire the conceit.\\n', '\\n', 'The captain having been at Tonquin, was, in his return to England, driven\\n', 'north-eastward to the latitude of 44 degrees, and longitude of 143.  But\\n', 'meeting a trade-wind two days after I came on board him, we sailed\\n', 'southward a long time, and coasting New Holland, kept our course\\n', 'west-south-west, and then south-south-west, till we doubled the Cape of\\n', 'Good Hope.  Our voyage was very prosperous, but I shall not trouble the\\n', 'reader with a journal of it.  The captain called in at one or two ports,\\n', 'and sent in his long-boat for provisions and fresh water; but I never\\n', 'went out of the ship till we came into the Downs, which was on the third\\n', 'day of June, 1706, about nine months after my escape.  I offered to leave\\n', 'my goods in security for payment of my freight: but the captain protested\\n', 'he would not receive one farthing.  We took a kind leave of each other,\\n', 'and I made him promise he would come to see me at my house in Redriff.  I\\n', 'hired a horse and guide for five shillings, which I borrowed of the\\n', 'captain.\\n', '\\n', 'As I was on the road, observing the littleness of the houses, the trees,\\n', 'the cattle, and the people, I began to think myself in Lilliput.  I was\\n', 'afraid of trampling on every traveller I met, and often called aloud to\\n', 'have them stand out of the way, so that I had like to have gotten one or\\n', 'two broken heads for my impertinence.\\n', '\\n', 'When I came to my own house, for which I was forced to inquire, one of\\n', 'the servants opening the door, I bent down to go in, (like a goose under\\n', 'a gate,) for fear of striking my head.  My wife run out to embrace me,\\n', 'but I stooped lower than her knees, thinking she could otherwise never be\\n', 'able to reach my mouth.  My daughter kneeled to ask my blessing, but I\\n', 'could not see her till she arose, having been so long used to stand with\\n', 'my head and eyes erect to above sixty feet; and then I went to take her\\n', 'up with one hand by the waist.  I looked down upon the servants, and one\\n', 'or two friends who were in the house, as if they had been pigmies and I a\\n', 'giant.  I told my wife, “she had been too thrifty, for I found she had\\n', 'starved herself and her daughter to nothing.”  In short, I behaved myself\\n', 'so unaccountably, that they were all of the captain’s opinion when he\\n', 'first saw me, and concluded I had lost my wits.  This I mention as an\\n', 'instance of the great power of habit and prejudice.\\n', '\\n', 'In a little time, I and my family and friends came to a right\\n', 'understanding: but my wife protested “I should never go to sea any more;”\\n', 'although my evil destiny so ordered, that she had not power to hinder me,\\n', 'as the reader may know hereafter.  In the mean time, I here conclude the\\n', 'second part of my unfortunate voyages.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'PART III.

He is received into\\n', 'Laputa.\\n', '\\n', 'I had not been at home above ten days, when Captain William Robinson, a\\n', 'Cornish man, commander of the Hopewell, a stout ship of three hundred\\n', 'tons, came to my house.  I had formerly been surgeon of another ship\\n', 'where he was master, and a fourth part owner, in a voyage to the Levant.\\n', 'He had always treated me more like a brother, than an inferior officer;\\n', 'and, hearing of my arrival, made me a visit, as I apprehended only out of\\n', 'friendship, for nothing passed more than what is usual after long\\n', 'absences.  But repeating his visits often, expressing his joy to find I\\n', 'me in good health, asking, “whether I were now settled for life?” adding,\\n', '“that he intended a voyage to the East Indies in two months,” at last he\\n', 'plainly invited me, though with some apologies, to be surgeon of the\\n', 'ship; “that I should have another surgeon under me, beside our two mates;\\n', 'that my salary should be double to the usual pay; and that having\\n', 'experienced my knowledge in sea-affairs to be at least equal to his, he\\n', 'would enter into any engagement to follow my advice, as much as if I had\\n', 'shared in the command.”\\n', '\\n', 'He said so many other obliging things, and I knew him to be so honest a\\n', 'man, that I could not reject this proposal; the thirst I had of seeing\\n', 'the world, notwithstanding my past misfortunes, continuing as violent as\\n', 'ever.  The only difficulty that remained, was to persuade my wife, whose\\n', 'consent however I at last obtained, by the prospect of advantage she\\n', 'proposed to her children.\\n', '\\n', 'We set out the 5th day of August, 1706, and arrived at Fort St. George\\n', 'the 11th of April, 1707.  We staid there three weeks to refresh our crew,\\n', 'many of whom were sick.  From thence we went to Tonquin, where the\\n', 'captain resolved to continue some time, because many of the goods he\\n', 'intended to buy were not ready, nor could he expect to be dispatched in\\n', 'several months.  Therefore, in hopes to defray some of the charges he\\n', 'must be at, he bought a sloop, loaded it with several sorts of goods,\\n', 'wherewith the Tonquinese usually trade to the neighbouring islands, and\\n', 'putting fourteen men on board, whereof three were of the country, he\\n', 'appointed me master of the sloop, and gave me power to traffic, while he\\n', 'transacted his affairs at Tonquin.\\n', '\\n', 'We had not sailed above three days, when a great storm arising, we were\\n', 'driven five days to the north-north-east, and then to the east: after\\n', 'which we had fair weather, but still with a pretty strong gale from the\\n', 'west.  Upon the tenth day we were chased by two pirates, who soon\\n', 'overtook us; for my sloop was so deep laden, that she sailed very slow,\\n', 'neither were we in a condition to defend ourselves.\\n', '\\n', 'We were boarded about the same time by both the pirates, who entered\\n', 'furiously at the head of their men; but finding us all prostrate upon our\\n', 'faces (for so I gave order), they pinioned us with strong ropes, and\\n', 'setting guard upon us, went to search the sloop.\\n', '\\n', 'I observed among them a Dutchman, who seemed to be of some authority,\\n', 'though he was not commander of either ship.  He knew us by our\\n', 'countenances to be Englishmen, and jabbering to us in his own language,\\n', 'swore we should be tied back to back and thrown into the sea.  I spoken\\n', 'Dutch tolerably well; I told him who we were, and begged him, in\\n', 'consideration of our being Christians and Protestants, of neighbouring\\n', 'countries in strict alliance, that he would move the captains to take\\n', 'some pity on us.  This inflamed his rage; he repeated his threatenings,\\n', 'and turning to his companions, spoke with great vehemence in the Japanese\\n', 'language, as I suppose, often using the word _Christianos_.\\n', '\\n', 'The largest of the two pirate ships was commanded by a Japanese captain,\\n', 'who spoke a little Dutch, but very imperfectly.  He came up to me, and\\n', 'after several questions, which I answered in great humility, he said, “we\\n', 'should not die.”  I made the captain a very low bow, and then, turning to\\n', 'the Dutchman, said, “I was sorry to find more mercy in a heathen, than in\\n', 'a brother christian.”  But I had soon reason to repent those foolish\\n', 'words: for that malicious reprobate, having often endeavoured in vain to\\n', 'persuade both the captains that I might be thrown into the sea (which\\n', 'they would not yield to, after the promise made me that I should not\\n', 'die), however, prevailed so far, as to have a punishment inflicted on me,\\n', 'worse, in all human appearance, than death itself.  My men were sent by\\n', 'an equal division into both the pirate ships, and my sloop new manned.\\n', 'As to myself, it was determined that I should be set adrift in a small\\n', 'canoe, with paddles and a sail, and four days’ provisions; which last,\\n', 'the Japanese captain was so kind to double out of his own stores, and\\n', 'would permit no man to search me.  I got down into the canoe, while the\\n', 'Dutchman, standing upon the deck, loaded me with all the curses and\\n', 'injurious terms his language could afford.\\n', '\\n', 'About an hour before we saw the pirates I had taken an observation, and\\n', 'found we were in the latitude of 46 N. and longitude of 183.  When I was\\n', 'at some distance from the pirates, I discovered, by my pocket-glass,\\n', 'several islands to the south-east.  I set up my sail, the wind being\\n', 'fair, with a design to reach the nearest of those islands, which I made a\\n', 'shift to do, in about three hours.  It was all rocky: however I got many\\n', 'birds’ eggs; and, striking fire, I kindled some heath and dry sea-weed,\\n', 'by which I roasted my eggs.  I ate no other supper, being resolved to\\n', 'spare my provisions as much as I could.  I passed the night under the\\n', 'shelter of a rock, strewing some heath under me, and slept pretty well.\\n', '\\n', 'The next day I sailed to another island, and thence to a third and\\n', 'fourth, sometimes using my sail, and sometimes my paddles.  But, not to\\n', 'trouble the reader with a particular account of my distresses, let it\\n', 'suffice, that on the fifth day I arrived at the last island in my sight,\\n', 'which lay south-south-east to the former.\\n', '\\n', 'This island was at a greater distance than I expected, and I did not\\n', 'reach it in less than five hours.  I encompassed it almost round, before\\n', 'I could find a convenient place to land in; which was a small creek,\\n', 'about three times the wideness of my canoe.  I found the island to be all\\n', 'rocky, only a little intermingled with tufts of grass, and sweet-smelling\\n', 'herbs.  I took out my small provisions and after having refreshed myself,\\n', 'I secured the remainder in a cave, whereof there were great numbers; I\\n', 'gathered plenty of eggs upon the rocks, and got a quantity of dry\\n', 'sea-weed, and parched grass, which I designed to kindle the next day, and\\n', 'roast my eggs as well as I could, for I had about me my flint, steel,\\n', 'match, and burning-glass.  I lay all night in the cave where I had lodged\\n', 'my provisions.  My bed was the same dry grass and sea-weed which I\\n', 'intended for fuel.  I slept very little, for the disquiets of my mind\\n', 'prevailed over my weariness, and kept me awake.  I considered how\\n', 'impossible it was to preserve my life in so desolate a place, and how\\n', 'miserable my end must be: yet found myself so listless and desponding,\\n', 'that I had not the heart to rise; and before I could get spirits enough\\n', 'to creep out of my cave, the day was far advanced.  I walked awhile among\\n', 'the rocks: the sky was perfectly clear, and the sun so hot, that I was\\n', 'forced to turn my face from it: when all on a sudden it became obscure,\\n', 'as I thought, in a manner very different from what happens by the\\n', 'interposition of a cloud.  I turned back, and perceived a vast opaque\\n', 'body between me and the sun moving forwards towards the island: it seemed\\n', 'to be about two miles high, and hid the sun six or seven minutes; but I\\n', 'did not observe the air to be much colder, or the sky more darkened, than\\n', 'if I had stood under the shade of a mountain.  As it approached nearer\\n', 'over the place where I was, it appeared to be a firm substance, the\\n', 'bottom flat, smooth, and shining very bright, from the reflection of the\\n', 'sea below.  I stood upon a height about two hundred yards from the shore,\\n', 'and saw this vast body descending almost to a parallel with me, at less\\n', 'than an English mile distance.  I took out my pocket perspective, and\\n', 'could plainly discover numbers of people moving up and down the sides of\\n', 'it, which appeared to be sloping; but what those people where doing I was\\n', 'not able to distinguish.\\n', '\\n', 'The natural love of life gave me some inward motion of joy, and I was\\n', 'ready to entertain a hope that this adventure might, some way or other,\\n', 'help to deliver me from the desolate place and condition I was in.  But\\n', 'at the same time the reader can hardly conceive my astonishment, to\\n', 'behold an island in the air, inhabited by men, who were able (as it\\n', 'should seem) to raise or sink, or put it into progressive motion, as they\\n', 'pleased.  But not being at that time in a disposition to philosophise\\n', 'upon this phenomenon, I rather chose to observe what course the island\\n', 'would take, because it seemed for awhile to stand still.  Yet soon after,\\n', 'it advanced nearer, and I could see the sides of it encompassed with\\n', 'several gradations of galleries, and stairs, at certain intervals, to\\n', 'descend from one to the other.  In the lowest gallery, I beheld some\\n', 'people fishing with long angling rods, and others looking on.  I waved my\\n', 'cap (for my hat was long since worn out) and my handkerchief toward the\\n', 'island; and upon its nearer approach, I called and shouted with the\\n', 'utmost strength of my voice; and then looking circumspectly, I beheld a\\n', 'crowd gather to that side which was most in my view.  I found by their\\n', 'pointing towards me and to each other, that they plainly discovered me,\\n', 'although they made no return to my shouting.  But I could see four or\\n', 'five men running in great haste, up the stairs, to the top of the island,\\n', 'who then disappeared.  I happened rightly to conjecture, that these were\\n', 'sent for orders to some person in authority upon this occasion.\\n', '\\n', 'The number of people increased, and, in less than half all hour, the\\n', 'island was moved and raised in such a manner, that the lowest gallery\\n', 'appeared in a parallel of less then a hundred yards distance from the\\n', 'height where I stood.  I then put myself in the most supplicating\\n', 'posture, and spoke in the humblest accent, but received no answer.  Those\\n', 'who stood nearest over against me, seemed to be persons of distinction,\\n', 'as I supposed by their habit.  They conferred earnestly with each other,\\n', 'looking often upon me.  At length one of them called out in a clear,\\n', 'polite, smooth dialect, not unlike in sound to the Italian: and therefore\\n', 'I returned an answer in that language, hoping at least that the cadence\\n', 'might be more agreeable to his ears.  Although neither of us understood\\n', 'the other, yet my meaning was easily known, for the people saw the\\n', 'distress I was in.\\n', '\\n', 'They made signs for me to come down from the rock, and go towards the\\n', 'shore, which I accordingly did; and the flying island being raised to a\\n', 'convenient height, the verge directly over me, a chain was let down from\\n', 'the lowest gallery, with a seat fastened to the bottom, to which I fixed\\n', 'myself, and was drawn up by pulleys.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER II.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The humours and dispositions of the Laputians described.  An account of\\n', 'their learning.  Of the king and his court.  The author’s reception\\n', 'there.  The inhabitants subject to fear and disquietudes.  An account of\\n', 'the women.\\n', '\\n', 'At my alighting, I was surrounded with a crowd of people, but those who\\n', 'stood nearest seemed to be of better quality.  They beheld me with all\\n', 'the marks and circumstances of wonder; neither indeed was I much in their\\n', 'debt, having never till then seen a race of mortals so singular in their\\n', 'shapes, habits, and countenances.  Their heads were all reclined, either\\n', 'to the right, or the left; one of their eyes turned inward, and the other\\n', 'directly up to the zenith.  Their outward garments were adorned with the\\n', 'figures of suns, moons, and stars; interwoven with those of fiddles,\\n', 'flutes, harps, trumpets, guitars, harpsichords, and many other\\n', 'instruments of music, unknown to us in Europe.  I observed, here and\\n', 'there, many in the habit of servants, with a blown bladder, fastened like\\n', 'a flail to the end of a stick, which they carried in their hands.  In\\n', 'each bladder was a small quantity of dried peas, or little pebbles, as I\\n', 'was afterwards informed.  With these bladders, they now and then flapped\\n', 'the mouths and ears of those who stood near them, of which practice I\\n', 'could not then conceive the meaning.  It seems the minds of these people\\n', 'are so taken up with intense speculations, that they neither can speak,\\n', 'nor attend to the discourses of others, without being roused by some\\n', 'external taction upon the organs of speech and hearing; for which reason,\\n', 'those persons who are able to afford it always keep a flapper (the\\n', 'original is _climenole_) in their family, as one of their domestics; nor\\n', 'ever walk abroad, or make visits, without him.  And the business of this\\n', 'officer is, when two, three, or more persons are in company, gently to\\n', 'strike with his bladder the mouth of him who is to speak, and the right\\n', 'ear of him or them to whom the speaker addresses himself.  This flapper\\n', 'is likewise employed diligently to attend his master in his walks, and\\n', 'upon occasion to give him a soft flap on his eyes; because he is always\\n', 'so wrapped up in cogitation, that he is in manifest danger of falling\\n', 'down every precipice, and bouncing his head against every post; and in\\n', 'the streets, of justling others, or being justled himself into the\\n', 'kennel.\\n', '\\n', 'It was necessary to give the reader this information, without which he\\n', 'would be at the same loss with me to understand the proceedings of these\\n', 'people, as they conducted me up the stairs to the top of the island, and\\n', 'from thence to the royal palace.  While we were ascending, they forgot\\n', 'several times what they were about, and left me to myself, till their\\n', 'memories were again roused by their flappers; for they appeared\\n', 'altogether unmoved by the sight of my foreign habit and countenance, and\\n', 'by the shouts of the vulgar, whose thoughts and minds were more\\n', 'disengaged.\\n', '\\n', 'At last we entered the palace, and proceeded into the chamber of\\n', 'presence, where I saw the king seated on his throne, attended on each\\n', 'side by persons of prime quality.  Before the throne, was a large table\\n', 'filled with globes and spheres, and mathematical instruments of all\\n', 'kinds.  His majesty took not the least notice of us, although our\\n', 'entrance was not without sufficient noise, by the concourse of all\\n', 'persons belonging to the court.  But he was then deep in a problem; and\\n', 'we attended at least an hour, before he could solve it.  There stood by\\n', 'him, on each side, a young page with flaps in their hands, and when they\\n', 'saw he was at leisure, one of them gently struck his mouth, and the other\\n', 'his right ear; at which he startled like one awaked on the sudden, and\\n', 'looking towards me and the company I was in, recollected the occasion of\\n', 'our coming, whereof he had been informed before.  He spoke some words,\\n', 'whereupon immediately a young man with a flap came up to my side, and\\n', 'flapped me gently on the right ear; but I made signs, as well as I could,\\n', 'that I had no occasion for such an instrument; which, as I afterwards\\n', 'found, gave his majesty, and the whole court, a very mean opinion of my\\n', 'understanding.  The king, as far as I could conjecture, asked me several\\n', 'questions, and I addressed myself to him in all the languages I had.\\n', 'When it was found I could neither understand nor be understood, I was\\n', 'conducted by his order to an apartment in his palace (this prince being\\n', 'distinguished above all his predecessors for his hospitality to\\n', 'strangers), where two servants were appointed to attend me.  My dinner\\n', 'was brought, and four persons of quality, whom I remembered to have seen\\n', 'very near the king’s person, did me the honour to dine with me.  We had\\n', 'two courses, of three dishes each.  In the first course, there was a\\n', 'shoulder of mutton cut into an equilateral triangle, a piece of beef into\\n', 'a rhomboides, and a pudding into a cycloid.  The second course was two\\n', 'ducks trussed up in the form of fiddles; sausages and puddings resembling\\n', 'flutes and hautboys, and a breast of veal in the shape of a harp.  The\\n', 'servants cut our bread into cones, cylinders, parallelograms, and several\\n', 'other mathematical figures.\\n', '\\n', 'While we were at dinner, I made bold to ask the names of several things\\n', 'in their language, and those noble persons, by the assistance of their\\n', 'flappers, delighted to give me answers, hoping to raise my admiration of\\n', 'their great abilities if I could be brought to converse with them.  I was\\n', 'soon able to call for bread and drink, or whatever else I wanted.\\n', '\\n', 'After dinner my company withdrew, and a person was sent to me by the\\n', 'king’s order, attended by a flapper.  He brought with him pen, ink, and\\n', 'paper, and three or four books, giving me to understand by signs, that he\\n', 'was sent to teach me the language.  We sat together four hours, in which\\n', 'time I wrote down a great number of words in columns, with the\\n', 'translations over against them; I likewise made a shift to learn several\\n', 'short sentences; for my tutor would order one of my servants to fetch\\n', 'something, to turn about, to make a bow, to sit, or to stand, or walk,\\n', 'and the like.  Then I took down the sentence in writing.  He showed me\\n', 'also, in one of his books, the figures of the sun, moon, and stars, the\\n', 'zodiac, the tropics, and polar circles, together with the denominations\\n', 'of many plains and solids.  He gave me the names and descriptions of all\\n', 'the musical instruments, and the general terms of art in playing on each\\n', 'of them.  After he had left me, I placed all my words, with their\\n', 'interpretations, in alphabetical order.  And thus, in a few days, by the\\n', 'help of a very faithful memory, I got some insight into their language.\\n', 'The word, which I interpret the flying or floating island, is in the\\n', 'original _Laputa_, whereof I could never learn the true etymology.\\n', '_Lap_, in the old obsolete language, signifies high; and _untuh_, a\\n', 'governor; from which they say, by corruption, was derived _Laputa_, from\\n', '_Lapuntuh_.  But I do not approve of this derivation, which seems to be a\\n', 'little strained.  I ventured to offer to the learned among them a\\n', 'conjecture of my own, that Laputa was _quasi lap outed_; _lap_,\\n', 'signifying properly, the dancing of the sunbeams in the sea, and _outed_,\\n', 'a wing; which, however, I shall not obtrude, but submit to the judicious\\n', 'reader.\\n', '\\n', 'Those to whom the king had entrusted me, observing how ill I was clad,\\n', 'ordered a tailor to come next morning, and take measure for a suit of\\n', 'clothes.  This operator did his office after a different manner from\\n', 'those of his trade in Europe.  He first took my altitude by a quadrant,\\n', 'and then, with a rule and compasses, described the dimensions and\\n', 'outlines of my whole body, all which he entered upon paper; and in six\\n', 'days brought my clothes very ill made, and quite out of shape, by\\n', 'happening to mistake a figure in the calculation.  But my comfort was,\\n', 'that I observed such accidents very frequent, and little regarded.\\n', '\\n', 'During my confinement for want of clothes, and by an indisposition that\\n', 'held me some days longer, I much enlarged my dictionary; and when I went\\n', 'next to court, was able to understand many things the king spoke, and to\\n', 'return him some kind of answers.  His majesty had given orders, that the\\n', 'island should move north-east and by east, to the vertical point over\\n', 'Lagado, the metropolis of the whole kingdom below, upon the firm earth.\\n', 'It was about ninety leagues distant, and our voyage lasted four days and\\n', 'a half.  I was not in the least sensible of the progressive motion made\\n', 'in the air by the island.  On the second morning, about eleven o’clock,\\n', 'the king himself in person, attended by his nobility, courtiers, and\\n', 'officers, having prepared all their musical instruments, played on them\\n', 'for three hours without intermission, so that I was quite stunned with\\n', 'the noise; neither could I possibly guess the meaning, till my tutor\\n', 'informed me.  He said that, the people of their island had their ears\\n', 'adapted to hear “the music of the spheres, which always played at certain\\n', 'periods, and the court was now prepared to bear their part, in whatever\\n', 'instrument they most excelled.”\\n', '\\n', 'In our journey towards Lagado, the capital city, his majesty ordered that\\n', 'the island should stop over certain towns and villages, from whence he\\n', 'might receive the petitions of his subjects.  And to this purpose,\\n', 'several packthreads were let down, with small weights at the bottom.  On\\n', 'these packthreads the people strung their petitions, which mounted up\\n', 'directly, like the scraps of paper fastened by school boys at the end of\\n', 'the string that holds their kite.  Sometimes we received wine and\\n', 'victuals from below, which were drawn up by pulleys.\\n', '\\n', 'The knowledge I had in mathematics, gave me great assistance in acquiring\\n', 'their phraseology, which depended much upon that science, and music; and\\n', 'in the latter I was not unskilled.  Their ideas are perpetually\\n', 'conversant in lines and figures.  If they would, for example, praise the\\n', 'beauty of a woman, or any other animal, they describe it by rhombs,\\n', 'circles, parallelograms, ellipses, and other geometrical terms, or by\\n', 'words of art drawn from music, needless here to repeat.  I observed in\\n', 'the king’s kitchen all sorts of mathematical and musical instruments,\\n', 'after the figures of which they cut up the joints that were served to his\\n', 'majesty’s table.\\n', '\\n', 'Their houses are very ill built, the walls bevil, without one right angle\\n', 'in any apartment; and this defect arises from the contempt they bear to\\n', 'practical geometry, which they despise as vulgar and mechanic; those\\n', 'instructions they give being too refined for the intellects of their\\n', 'workmen, which occasions perpetual mistakes.  And although they are\\n', 'dexterous enough upon a piece of paper, in the management of the rule,\\n', 'the pencil, and the divider, yet in the common actions and behaviour of\\n', 'life, I have not seen a more clumsy, awkward, and unhandy people, nor so\\n', 'slow and perplexed in their conceptions upon all other subjects, except\\n', 'those of mathematics and music.  They are very bad reasoners, and\\n', 'vehemently given to opposition, unless when they happen to be of the\\n', 'right opinion, which is seldom their case.  Imagination, fancy, and\\n', 'invention, they are wholly strangers to, nor have any words in their\\n', 'language, by which those ideas can be expressed; the whole compass of\\n', 'their thoughts and mind being shut up within the two forementioned\\n', 'sciences.\\n', '\\n', 'Most of them, and especially those who deal in the astronomical part,\\n', 'have great faith in judicial astrology, although they are ashamed to own\\n', 'it publicly.  But what I chiefly admired, and thought altogether\\n', 'unaccountable, was the strong disposition I observed in them towards news\\n', 'and politics, perpetually inquiring into public affairs, giving their\\n', 'judgments in matters of state, and passionately disputing every inch of a\\n', 'party opinion.  I have indeed observed the same disposition among most of\\n', 'the mathematicians I have known in Europe, although I could never\\n', 'discover the least analogy between the two sciences; unless those people\\n', 'suppose, that because the smallest circle has as many degrees as the\\n', 'largest, therefore the regulation and management of the world require no\\n', 'more abilities than the handling and turning of a globe; but I rather\\n', 'take this quality to spring from a very common infirmity of human nature,\\n', 'inclining us to be most curious and conceited in matters where we have\\n', 'least concern, and for which we are least adapted by study or nature.\\n', '\\n', 'These people are under continual disquietudes, never enjoying a minutes\\n', 'peace of mind; and their disturbances proceed from causes which very\\n', 'little affect the rest of mortals.  Their apprehensions arise from\\n', 'several changes they dread in the celestial bodies: for instance, that\\n', 'the earth, by the continual approaches of the sun towards it, must, in\\n', 'course of time, be absorbed, or swallowed up; that the face of the sun,\\n', 'will, by degrees, be encrusted with its own effluvia, and give no more\\n', 'light to the world; that the earth very narrowly escaped a brush from the\\n', 'tail of the last comet, which would have infallibly reduced it to ashes;\\n', 'and that the next, which they have calculated for one-and-thirty years\\n', 'hence, will probably destroy us.  For if, in its perihelion, it should\\n', 'approach within a certain degree of the sun (as by their calculations\\n', 'they have reason to dread) it will receive a degree of heat ten thousand\\n', 'times more intense than that of red hot glowing iron, and in its absence\\n', 'from the sun, carry a blazing tail ten hundred thousand and fourteen\\n', 'miles long, through which, if the earth should pass at the distance of\\n', 'one hundred thousand miles from the nucleus, or main body of the comet,\\n', 'it must in its passage be set on fire, and reduced to ashes: that the\\n', 'sun, daily spending its rays without any nutriment to supply them, will\\n', 'at last be wholly consumed and annihilated; which must be attended with\\n', 'the destruction of this earth, and of all the planets that receive their\\n', 'light from it.\\n', '\\n', 'They are so perpetually alarmed with the apprehensions of these, and the\\n', 'like impending dangers, that they can neither sleep quietly in their\\n', 'beds, nor have any relish for the common pleasures and amusements of\\n', 'life.  When they meet an acquaintance in the morning, the first question\\n', 'is about the sun’s health, how he looked at his setting and rising, and\\n', 'what hopes they have to avoid the stroke of the approaching comet.  This\\n', 'conversation they are apt to run into with the same temper that boys\\n', 'discover in delighting to hear terrible stories of spirits and\\n', 'hobgoblins, which they greedily listen to, and dare not go to bed for\\n', 'fear.\\n', '\\n', 'The women of the island have abundance of vivacity: they, contemn their\\n', 'husbands, and are exceedingly fond of strangers, whereof there is always\\n', 'a considerable number from the continent below, attending at court,\\n', 'either upon affairs of the several towns and corporations, or their own\\n', 'particular occasions, but are much despised, because they want the same\\n', 'endowments.  Among these the ladies choose their gallants: but the\\n', 'vexation is, that they act with too much ease and security; for the\\n', 'husband is always so rapt in speculation, that the mistress and lover may\\n', 'proceed to the greatest familiarities before his face, if he be but\\n', 'provided with paper and implements, and without his flapper at his side.\\n', '\\n', 'The wives and daughters lament their confinement to the island, although\\n', 'I think it the most delicious spot of ground in the world; and although\\n', 'they live here in the greatest plenty and magnificence, and are allowed\\n', 'to do whatever they please, they long to see the world, and take the\\n', 'diversions of the metropolis, which they are not allowed to do without a\\n', 'particular license from the king; and this is not easy to be obtained,\\n', 'because the people of quality have found, by frequent experience, how\\n', 'hard it is to persuade their women to return from below.  I was told that\\n', 'a great court lady, who had several children,—is married to the prime\\n', 'minister, the richest subject in the kingdom, a very graceful person,\\n', 'extremely fond of her, and lives in the finest palace of the island,—went\\n', 'down to Lagado on the pretence of health, there hid herself for several\\n', 'months, till the king sent a warrant to search for her; and she was found\\n', 'in an obscure eating-house all in rags, having pawned her clothes to\\n', 'maintain an old deformed footman, who beat her every day, and in whose\\n', 'company she was taken, much against her will.  And although her husband\\n', 'received her with all possible kindness, and without the least reproach,\\n', 'she soon after contrived to steal down again, with all her jewels, to the\\n', 'same gallant, and has not been heard of since.\\n', '\\n', 'This may perhaps pass with the reader rather for an European or English\\n', 'story, than for one of a country so remote.  But he may please to\\n', 'consider, that the caprices of womankind are not limited by any climate\\n', 'or nation, and that they are much more uniform, than can be easily\\n', 'imagined.\\n', '\\n', 'In about a month’s time, I had made a tolerable proficiency in their\\n', 'language, and was able to answer most of the king’s questions, when I had\\n', 'the honour to attend him.  His majesty discovered not the least curiosity\\n', 'to inquire into the laws, government, history, religion, or manners of\\n', 'the countries where I had been; but confined his questions to the state\\n', 'of mathematics, and received the account I gave him with great contempt\\n', 'and indifference, though often roused by his flapper on each side.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER III.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'A phenomenon solved by modern philosophy and astronomy.  The Laputians’\\n', 'great improvements in the latter.  The king’s method of suppressing\\n', 'insurrections.\\n', '\\n', 'I desired leave of this prince to see the curiosities of the island,\\n', 'which he was graciously pleased to grant, and ordered my tutor to attend\\n', 'me.  I chiefly wanted to know, to what cause, in art or in nature, it\\n', 'owed its several motions, whereof I will now give a philosophical account\\n', 'to the reader.\\n', '\\n', 'The flying or floating island is exactly circular, its diameter 7837\\n', 'yards, or about four miles and a half, and consequently contains ten\\n', 'thousand acres.  It is three hundred yards thick.  The bottom, or under\\n', 'surface, which appears to those who view it below, is one even regular\\n', 'plate of adamant, shooting up to the height of about two hundred yards.\\n', 'Above it lie the several minerals in their usual order, and over all is a\\n', 'coat of rich mould, ten or twelve feet deep.  The declivity of the upper\\n', 'surface, from the circumference to the centre, is the natural cause why\\n', 'all the dews and rains, which fall upon the island, are conveyed in small\\n', 'rivulets toward the middle, where they are emptied into four large\\n', 'basins, each of about half a mile in circuit, and two hundred yards\\n', 'distant from the centre.  From these basins the water is continually\\n', 'exhaled by the sun in the daytime, which effectually prevents their\\n', 'overflowing.  Besides, as it is in the power of the monarch to raise the\\n', 'island above the region of clouds and vapours, he can prevent the falling\\n', 'of dews and rain whenever he pleases.  For the highest clouds cannot rise\\n', 'above two miles, as naturalists agree, at least they were never known to\\n', 'do so in that country.\\n', '\\n', 'At the centre of the island there is a chasm about fifty yards in\\n', 'diameter, whence the astronomers descend into a large dome, which is\\n', 'therefore called _flandona gagnole_, or the astronomer’s cave, situated\\n', 'at the depth of a hundred yards beneath the upper surface of the adamant.\\n', 'In this cave are twenty lamps continually burning, which, from the\\n', 'reflection of the adamant, cast a strong light into every part.  The\\n', 'place is stored with great variety of sextants, quadrants, telescopes,\\n', 'astrolabes, and other astronomical instruments.  But the greatest\\n', 'curiosity, upon which the fate of the island depends, is a loadstone of a\\n', 'prodigious size, in shape resembling a weaver’s shuttle.  It is in length\\n', 'six yards, and in the thickest part at least three yards over.  This\\n', 'magnet is sustained by a very strong axle of adamant passing through its\\n', 'middle, upon which it plays, and is poised so exactly that the weakest\\n', 'hand can turn it.  It is hooped round with a hollow cylinder of adamant,\\n', 'four feet yards in diameter, placed horizontally, and supported by eight\\n', 'adamantine feet, each six yards high.  In the middle of the concave side,\\n', 'there is a groove twelve inches deep, in which the extremities of the\\n', 'axle are lodged, and turned round as there is occasion.\\n', '\\n', 'The stone cannot be removed from its place by any force, because the hoop\\n', 'and its feet are one continued piece with that body of adamant which\\n', 'constitutes the bottom of the island.\\n', '\\n', 'By means of this loadstone, the island is made to rise and fall, and move\\n', 'from one place to another.  For, with respect to that part of the earth\\n', 'over which the monarch presides, the stone is endued at one of its sides\\n', 'with an attractive power, and at the other with a repulsive.  Upon\\n', 'placing the magnet erect, with its attracting end towards the earth, the\\n', 'island descends; but when the repelling extremity points downwards, the\\n', 'island mounts directly upwards.  When the position of the stone is\\n', 'oblique, the motion of the island is so too: for in this magnet, the\\n', 'forces always act in lines parallel to its direction.\\n', '\\n', 'By this oblique motion, the island is conveyed to different parts of the\\n', 'monarch’s dominions.  To explain the manner of its progress, let _A_ _B_\\n', 'represent a line drawn across the dominions of Balnibarbi, let the line\\n', '_c_ _d_ represent the loadstone, of which let _d_ be the repelling end,\\n', 'and _c_ the attracting end, the island being over _C_: let the stone be\\n', 'placed in position _c_ _d_, with its repelling end downwards; then the\\n', 'island will be driven upwards obliquely towards _D_.  When it is arrived\\n', 'at _D_, let the stone be turned upon its axle, till its attracting end\\n', 'points towards _E_, and then the island will be carried obliquely towards\\n', '_E_; where, if the stone be again turned upon its axle till it stands in\\n', 'the position _E_ _F_, with its repelling point downwards, the island will\\n', 'rise obliquely towards _F_, where, by directing the attracting end\\n', 'towards _G_, the island may be carried to _G_, and from _G_ to _H_, by\\n', 'turning the stone, so as to make its repelling extremity to point\\n', 'directly downward.  And thus, by changing the situation of the stone, as\\n', 'often as there is occasion, the island is made to rise and fall by turns\\n', 'in an oblique direction, and by those alternate risings and fallings (the\\n', 'obliquity being not considerable) is conveyed from one part of the\\n', 'dominions to the other.\\n', '\\n', 'But it must be observed, that this island cannot move beyond the extent\\n', 'of the dominions below, nor can it rise above the height of four miles.\\n', 'For which the astronomers (who have written large systems concerning the\\n', 'stone) assign the following reason: that the magnetic virtue does not\\n', 'extend beyond the distance of four miles, and that the mineral, which\\n', 'acts upon the stone in the bowels of the earth, and in the sea about six\\n', 'leagues distant from the shore, is not diffused through the whole globe,\\n', 'but terminated with the limits of the king’s dominions; and it was easy,\\n', 'from the great advantage of such a superior situation, for a prince to\\n', 'bring under his obedience whatever country lay within the attraction of\\n', 'that magnet.\\n', '\\n', 'When the stone is put parallel to the plane of the horizon, the island\\n', 'stands still; for in that case the extremities of it, being at equal\\n', 'distance from the earth, act with equal force, the one in drawing\\n', 'downwards, the other in pushing upwards, and consequently no motion can\\n', 'ensue.\\n', '\\n', 'This loadstone is under the care of certain astronomers, who, from time\\n', 'to time, give it such positions as the monarch directs.  They spend the\\n', 'greatest part of their lives in observing the celestial bodies, which\\n', 'they do by the assistance of glasses, far excelling ours in goodness.\\n', 'For, although their largest telescopes do not exceed three feet, they\\n', 'magnify much more than those of a hundred with us, and show the stars\\n', 'with greater clearness.  This advantage has enabled them to extend their\\n', 'discoveries much further than our astronomers in Europe; for they have\\n', 'made a catalogue of ten thousand fixed stars, whereas the largest of ours\\n', 'do not contain above one third part of that number.  They have likewise\\n', 'discovered two lesser stars, or satellites, which revolve about Mars;\\n', 'whereof the innermost is distant from the centre of the primary planet\\n', 'exactly three of his diameters, and the outermost, five; the former\\n', 'revolves in the space of ten hours, and the latter in twenty-one and a\\n', 'half; so that the squares of their periodical times are very near in the\\n', 'same proportion with the cubes of their distance from the centre of Mars;\\n', 'which evidently shows them to be governed by the same law of gravitation\\n', 'that influences the other heavenly bodies.\\n', '\\n', 'They have observed ninety-three different comets, and settled their\\n', 'periods with great exactness.  If this be true (and they affirm it with\\n', 'great confidence) it is much to be wished, that their observations were\\n', 'made public, whereby the theory of comets, which at present is very lame\\n', 'and defective, might be brought to the same perfection with other arts of\\n', 'astronomy.\\n', '\\n', 'The king would be the most absolute prince in the universe, if he could\\n', 'but prevail on a ministry to join with him; but these having their\\n', 'estates below on the continent, and considering that the office of a\\n', 'favourite has a very uncertain tenure, would never consent to the\\n', 'enslaving of their country.\\n', '\\n', 'If any town should engage in rebellion or mutiny, fall into violent\\n', 'factions, or refuse to pay the usual tribute, the king has two methods of\\n', 'reducing them to obedience.  The first and the mildest course is, by\\n', 'keeping the island hovering over such a town, and the lands about it,\\n', 'whereby he can deprive them of the benefit of the sun and the rain, and\\n', 'consequently afflict the inhabitants with dearth and diseases: and if the\\n', 'crime deserve it, they are at the same time pelted from above with great\\n', 'stones, against which they have no defence but by creeping into cellars\\n', 'or caves, while the roofs of their houses are beaten to pieces.  But if\\n', 'they still continue obstinate, or offer to raise insurrections, he\\n', 'proceeds to the last remedy, by letting the island drop directly upon\\n', 'their heads, which makes a universal destruction both of houses and men.\\n', 'However, this is an extremity to which the prince is seldom driven,\\n', 'neither indeed is he willing to put it in execution; nor dare his\\n', 'ministers advise him to an action, which, as it would render them odious\\n', 'to the people, so it would be a great damage to their own estates, which\\n', 'all lie below; for the island is the king’s demesne.\\n', '\\n', 'But there is still indeed a more weighty reason, why the kings of this\\n', 'country have been always averse from executing so terrible an action,\\n', 'unless upon the utmost necessity.  For, if the town intended to be\\n', 'destroyed should have in it any tall rocks, as it generally falls out in\\n', 'the larger cities, a situation probably chosen at first with a view to\\n', 'prevent such a catastrophe; or if it abound in high spires, or pillars of\\n', 'stone, a sudden fall might endanger the bottom or under surface of the\\n', 'island, which, although it consist, as I have said, of one entire\\n', 'adamant, two hundred yards thick, might happen to crack by too great a\\n', 'shock, or burst by approaching too near the fires from the houses below,\\n', 'as the backs, both of iron and stone, will often do in our chimneys.  Of\\n', 'all this the people are well apprised, and understand how far to carry\\n', 'their obstinacy, where their liberty or property is concerned.  And the\\n', 'king, when he is highest provoked, and most determined to press a city to\\n', 'rubbish, orders the island to descend with great gentleness, out of a\\n', 'pretence of tenderness to his people, but, indeed, for fear of breaking\\n', 'the adamantine bottom; in which case, it is the opinion of all their\\n', 'philosophers, that the loadstone could no longer hold it up, and the\\n', 'whole mass would fall to the ground.\\n', '\\n', 'By a fundamental law of this realm, neither the king, nor either of his\\n', 'two eldest sons, are permitted to leave the island; nor the queen, till\\n', 'she is past child-bearing.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER IV.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The author leaves Laputa; is conveyed to Balnibarbi; arrives at the\\n', 'metropolis.

The people in the\\n', 'streets walked fast, looked wild, their eyes fixed, and were generally in\\n', 'rags.  We passed through one of the town gates, and went about three\\n', 'miles into the country, where I saw many labourers working with several\\n', 'sorts of tools in the ground, but was not able to conjecture what they\\n', 'were about: neither did observe any expectation either of corn or grass,\\n', 'although the soil appeared to be excellent.  I could not forbear admiring\\n', 'at these odd appearances, both in town and country; and I made bold to\\n', 'desire my conductor, that he would be pleased to explain to me, what\\n', 'could be meant by so many busy heads, hands, and faces, both in the\\n', 'streets and the fields, because I did not discover any good effects they\\n', 'produced; but, on the contrary, I never knew a soil so unhappily\\n', 'cultivated, houses so ill contrived and so ruinous, or a people whose\\n', 'countenances and habit expressed so much misery and want.\\n', '\\n', 'This lord Munodi was a person of the first rank, and had been some years\\n', 'governor of Lagado; but, by a cabal of ministers, was discharged for\\n', 'insufficiency.  However, the king treated him with tenderness, as a\\n', 'well-meaning man, but of a low contemptible understanding.\\n', '\\n', 'When I gave that free censure of the country and its inhabitants, he made\\n', 'no further answer than by telling me, “that I had not been long enough\\n', 'among them to form a judgment; and that the different nations of the\\n', 'world had different customs;” with other common topics to the same\\n', 'purpose.  But, when we returned to his palace, he asked me “how I liked\\n', 'the building, what absurdities I observed, and what quarrel I had with\\n', 'the dress or looks of his domestics?”  This he might safely do; because\\n', 'every thing about him was magnificent, regular, and polite.  I answered,\\n', '“that his excellency’s prudence, quality, and fortune, had exempted him\\n', 'from those defects, which folly and beggary had produced in others.”  He\\n', 'said, “if I would go with him to his country-house, about twenty miles\\n', 'distant, where his estate lay, there would be more leisure for this kind\\n', 'of conversation.”  I told his excellency “that I was entirely at his\\n', 'disposal;” and accordingly we set out next morning.\\n', '\\n', 'During our journey he made me observe the several methods used by farmers\\n', 'in managing their lands, which to me were wholly unaccountable; for,\\n', 'except in some very few places, I could not discover one ear of corn or\\n', 'blade of grass.  But, in three hours travelling, the scene was wholly\\n', 'altered; we came into a most beautiful country; farmers’ houses, at small\\n', 'distances, neatly built; the fields enclosed, containing vineyards,\\n', 'corn-grounds, and meadows.  Neither do I remember to have seen a more\\n', 'delightful prospect.  His excellency observed my countenance to clear up;\\n', 'he told me, with a sigh, “that there his estate began, and would continue\\n', 'the same, till we should come to his house: that his countrymen ridiculed\\n', 'and despised him, for managing his affairs no better, and for setting so\\n', 'ill an example to the kingdom; which, however, was followed by very few,\\n', 'such as were old, and wilful, and weak like himself.”\\n', '\\n', 'We came at length to the house, which was indeed a noble structure, built\\n', 'according to the best rules of ancient architecture.  The fountains,\\n', 'gardens, walks, avenues, and groves, were all disposed with exact\\n', 'judgment and taste.  I gave due praises to every thing I saw, whereof his\\n', 'excellency took not the least notice till after supper; when, there being\\n', 'no third companion, he told me with a very melancholy air “that he\\n', 'doubted he must throw down his houses in town and country, to rebuild\\n', 'them after the present mode; destroy all his plantations, and cast others\\n', 'into such a form as modern usage required, and give the same directions\\n', 'to all his tenants, unless he would submit to incur the censure of pride,\\n', 'singularity, affectation, ignorance, caprice, and perhaps increase his\\n', 'majesty’s displeasure; that the admiration I appeared to be under would\\n', 'cease or diminish, when he had informed me of some particulars which,\\n', 'probably, I never heard of at court, the people there being too much\\n', 'taken up in their own speculations, to have regard to what passed here\\n', 'below.”\\n', '\\n', 'The sum of his discourse was to this effect: “That about forty years ago,\\n', 'certain persons went up to Laputa, either upon business or diversion,\\n', 'and, after five months continuance, came back with a very little\\n', 'smattering in mathematics, but full of volatile spirits acquired in that\\n', 'airy region: that these persons, upon their return, began to dislike the\\n', 'management of every thing below, and fell into schemes of putting all\\n', 'arts, sciences, languages, and mechanics, upon a new foot.  To this end,\\n', 'they procured a royal patent for erecting an academy of projectors in\\n', 'Lagado; and the humour prevailed so strongly among the people, that there\\n', 'is not a town of any consequence in the kingdom without such an academy.\\n', 'In these colleges the professors contrive new rules and methods of\\n', 'agriculture and building, and new instruments, and tools for all trades\\n', 'and manufactures; whereby, as they undertake, one man shall do the work\\n', 'of ten; a palace may be built in a week, of materials so durable as to\\n', 'last for ever without repairing.  All the fruits of the earth shall come\\n', 'to maturity at whatever season we think fit to choose, and increase a\\n', 'hundred fold more than they do at present; with innumerable other happy\\n', 'proposals.  The only inconvenience is, that none of these projects are\\n', 'yet brought to perfection; and in the mean time, the whole country lies\\n', 'miserably waste, the houses in ruins, and the people without food or\\n', 'clothes.  By all which, instead of being discouraged, they are fifty\\n', 'times more violently bent upon prosecuting their schemes, driven equally\\n', 'on by hope and despair: that as for himself, being not of an enterprising\\n', 'spirit, he was content to go on in the old forms, to live in the houses\\n', 'his ancestors had built, and act as they did, in every part of life,\\n', 'without innovation: that some few other persons of quality and gentry had\\n', 'done the same, but were looked on with an eye of contempt and ill-will,\\n', 'as enemies to art, ignorant, and ill common-wealth’s men, preferring\\n', 'their own ease and sloth before the general improvement of their\\n', 'country.”\\n', '\\n', 'His lordship added, “That he would not, by any further particulars,\\n', 'prevent the pleasure I should certainly take in viewing the grand\\n', 'academy, whither he was resolved I should go.”  He only desired me to\\n', 'observe a ruined building, upon the side of a mountain about three miles\\n', 'distant, of which he gave me this account: “That he had a very convenient\\n', 'mill within half a mile of his house, turned by a current from a large\\n', 'river, and sufficient for his own family, as well as a great number of\\n', 'his tenants; that about seven years ago, a club of those projectors came\\n', 'to him with proposals to destroy this mill, and build another on the side\\n', 'of that mountain, on the long ridge whereof a long canal must be cut, for\\n', 'a repository of water, to be conveyed up by pipes and engines to supply\\n', 'the mill, because the wind and air upon a height agitated the water, and\\n', 'thereby made it fitter for motion, and because the water, descending down\\n', 'a declivity, would turn the mill with half the current of a river whose\\n', 'course is more upon a level.”  He said, “that being then not very well\\n', 'with the court, and pressed by many of his friends, he complied with the\\n', 'proposal; and after employing a hundred men for two years, the work\\n', 'miscarried, the projectors went off, laying the blame entirely upon him,\\n', 'railing at him ever since, and putting others upon the same experiment,\\n', 'with equal assurance of success, as well as equal disappointment.”\\n', '\\n', 'In a few days we came back to town; and his excellency, considering the\\n', 'bad character he had in the academy, would not go with me himself, but\\n', 'recommended me to a friend of his, to bear me company thither.  My lord\\n', 'was pleased to represent me as a great admirer of projects, and a person\\n', 'of much curiosity and easy belief; which, indeed, was not without truth;\\n', 'for I had myself been a sort of projector in my younger days.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER V.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The author permitted to see the grand academy of Lagado.  The academy\\n', 'largely described.  The arts wherein the professors employ themselves.\\n', '\\n', 'This academy is not an entire single building, but a continuation of\\n', 'several houses on both sides of a street, which growing waste, was\\n', 'purchased and applied to that use.\\n', '\\n', 'I was received very kindly by the warden, and went for many days to the\\n', 'academy.  Every room has in it one or more projectors; and I believe I\\n', 'could not be in fewer than five hundred rooms.\\n', '\\n', 'The first man I saw was of a meagre aspect, with sooty hands and face,\\n', 'his hair and beard long, ragged, and singed in several places.  His\\n', 'clothes, shirt, and skin, were all of the same colour.  He has been eight\\n', 'years upon a project for extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers, which were\\n', 'to be put in phials hermetically sealed, and let out to warm the air in\\n', 'raw inclement summers.  He told me, he did not doubt, that, in eight\\n', 'years more, he should be able to supply the governor’s gardens with\\n', 'sunshine, at a reasonable rate: but he complained that his stock was low,\\n', 'and entreated me “to give him something as an encouragement to ingenuity,\\n', 'especially since this had been a very dear season for cucumbers.”  I made\\n', 'him a small present, for my lord had furnished me with money on purpose,\\n', 'because he knew their practice of begging from all who go to see them.\\n', '\\n', 'I went into another chamber, but was ready to hasten back, being almost\\n', 'overcome with a horrible stink.  My conductor pressed me forward,\\n', 'conjuring me in a whisper “to give no offence, which would be highly\\n', 'resented;” and therefore I durst not so much as stop my nose.  The\\n', 'projector of this cell was the most ancient student of the academy; his\\n', 'face and beard were of a pale yellow; his hands and clothes daubed over\\n', 'with filth.  When I was presented to him, he gave me a close embrace, a\\n', 'compliment I could well have excused.  His employment, from his first\\n', 'coming into the academy, was an operation to reduce human excrement to\\n', 'its original food, by separating the several parts, removing the tincture\\n', 'which it receives from the gall, making the odour exhale, and scumming\\n', 'off the saliva.  He had a weekly allowance, from the society, of a vessel\\n', 'filled with human ordure, about the bigness of a Bristol barrel.\\n', '\\n', 'I saw another at work to calcine ice into gunpowder; who likewise showed\\n', 'me a treatise he had written concerning the malleability of fire, which\\n', 'he intended to publish.\\n', '\\n', 'There was a most ingenious architect, who had contrived a new method for\\n', 'building houses, by beginning at the roof, and working downward to the\\n', 'foundation; which he justified to me, by the like practice of those two\\n', 'prudent insects, the bee and the spider.\\n', '\\n', 'There was a man born blind, who had several apprentices in his own\\n', 'condition: their employment was to mix colours for painters, which their\\n', 'master taught them to distinguish by feeling and smelling.  It was indeed\\n', 'my misfortune to find them at that time not very perfect in their\\n', 'lessons, and the professor himself happened to be generally mistaken.\\n', 'This artist is much encouraged and esteemed by the whole fraternity.\\n', '\\n', 'In another apartment I was highly pleased with a projector who had found\\n', 'a device of ploughing the ground with hogs, to save the charges of\\n', 'ploughs, cattle, and labour.  The method is this: in an acre of ground\\n', 'you bury, at six inches distance and eight deep, a quantity of acorns,\\n', 'dates, chestnuts, and other mast or vegetables, whereof these animals are\\n', 'fondest; then you drive six hundred or more of them into the field,\\n', 'where, in a few days, they will root up the whole ground in search of\\n', 'their food, and make it fit for sowing, at the same time manuring it with\\n', 'their dung: it is true, upon experiment, they found the charge and\\n', 'trouble very great, and they had little or no crop.  However it is not\\n', 'doubted, that this invention may be capable of great improvement.\\n', '\\n', 'I went into another room, where the walls and ceiling were all hung round\\n', 'with cobwebs, except a narrow passage for the artist to go in and out.\\n', 'At my entrance, he called aloud to me, “not to disturb his webs.”  He\\n', 'lamented “the fatal mistake the world had been so long in, of using\\n', 'silkworms, while we had such plenty of domestic insects who infinitely\\n', 'excelled the former, because they understood how to weave, as well as\\n', 'spin.”  And he proposed further, “that by employing spiders, the charge\\n', 'of dyeing silks should be wholly saved;” whereof I was fully convinced,\\n', 'when he showed me a vast number of flies most beautifully coloured,\\n', 'wherewith he fed his spiders, assuring us “that the webs would take a\\n', 'tincture from them; and as he had them of all hues, he hoped to fit\\n', 'everybody’s fancy, as soon as he could find proper food for the flies, of\\n', 'certain gums, oils, and other glutinous matter, to give a strength and\\n', 'consistence to the threads.”\\n', '\\n', 'There was an astronomer, who had undertaken to place a sun-dial upon the\\n', 'great weathercock on the town-house, by adjusting the annual and diurnal\\n', 'motions of the earth and sun, so as to answer and coincide with all\\n', 'accidental turnings of the wind.\\n', '\\n', 'I was complaining of a small fit of the colic, upon which my conductor\\n', 'led me into a room where a great physician resided, who was famous for\\n', 'curing that disease, by contrary operations from the same instrument.  He\\n', 'had a large pair of bellows, with a long slender muzzle of ivory: this he\\n', 'conveyed eight inches up the anus, and drawing in the wind, he affirmed\\n', 'he could make the guts as lank as a dried bladder.  But when the disease\\n', 'was more stubborn and violent, he let in the muzzle while the bellows\\n', 'were full of wind, which he discharged into the body of the patient; then\\n', 'withdrew the instrument to replenish it, clapping his thumb strongly\\n', 'against the orifice of then fundament; and this being repeated three or\\n', 'four times, the adventitious wind would rush out, bringing the noxious\\n', 'along with it, (like water put into a pump), and the patient recovered.\\n', 'I saw him try both experiments upon a dog, but could not discern any\\n', 'effect from the former.  After the latter the animal was ready to burst,\\n', 'and made so violent a discharge as was very offensive to me and my\\n', 'companion.  The dog died on the spot, and we left the doctor endeavouring\\n', 'to recover him, by the same operation.\\n', '\\n', 'I visited many other apartments, but shall not trouble my reader with all\\n', 'the curiosities I observed, being studious of brevity.\\n', '\\n', 'I had hitherto seen only one side of the academy, the other being\\n', 'appropriated to the advancers of speculative learning, of whom I shall\\n', 'say something, when I have mentioned one illustrious person more, who is\\n', 'called among them “the universal artist.”  He told us “he had been thirty\\n', 'years employing his thoughts for the improvement of human life.”  He had\\n', 'two large rooms full of wonderful curiosities, and fifty men at work.\\n', 'Some were condensing air into a dry tangible substance, by extracting the\\n', 'nitre, and letting the aqueous or fluid particles percolate; others\\n', 'softening marble, for pillows and pin-cushions; others petrifying the\\n', 'hoofs of a living horse, to preserve them from foundering.  The artist\\n', 'himself was at that time busy upon two great designs; the first, to sow\\n', 'land with chaff, wherein he affirmed the true seminal virtue to be\\n', 'contained, as he demonstrated by several experiments, which I was not\\n', 'skilful enough to comprehend.  The other was, by a certain composition of\\n', 'gums, minerals, and vegetables, outwardly applied, to prevent the growth\\n', 'of wool upon two young lambs; and he hoped, in a reasonable time to\\n', 'propagate the breed of naked sheep, all over the kingdom.\\n', '\\n', 'We crossed a walk to the other part of the academy, where, as I have\\n', 'already said, the projectors in speculative learning resided.\\n', '\\n', 'The first professor I saw, was in a very large room, with forty pupils\\n', 'about him.  After salutation, observing me to look earnestly upon a\\n', 'frame, which took up the greatest part of both the length and breadth of\\n', 'the room, he said, “Perhaps I might wonder to see him employed in a\\n', 'project for improving speculative knowledge, by practical and mechanical\\n', 'operations.  But the world would soon be sensible of its usefulness; and\\n', 'he flattered himself, that a more noble, exalted thought never sprang in\\n', 'any other man’s head.  Every one knew how laborious the usual method is\\n', 'of attaining to arts and sciences; whereas, by his contrivance, the most\\n', 'ignorant person, at a reasonable charge, and with a little bodily labour,\\n', 'might write books in philosophy, poetry, politics, laws, mathematics, and\\n', 'theology, without the least assistance from genius or study.”  He then\\n', 'led me to the frame, about the sides, whereof all his pupils stood in\\n', 'ranks.  It was twenty feet square, placed in the middle of the room.  The\\n', 'superfices was composed of several bits of wood, about the bigness of a\\n', 'die, but some larger than others.  They were all linked together by\\n', 'slender wires.  These bits of wood were covered, on every square, with\\n', 'paper pasted on them; and on these papers were written all the words of\\n', 'their language, in their several moods, tenses, and declensions; but\\n', 'without any order.  The professor then desired me “to observe; for he was\\n', 'going to set his engine at work.”  The pupils, at his command, took each\\n', 'of them hold of an iron handle, whereof there were forty fixed round the\\n', 'edges of the frame; and giving them a sudden turn, the whole disposition\\n', 'of the words was entirely changed.  He then commanded six-and-thirty of\\n', 'the lads, to read the several lines softly, as they appeared upon the\\n', 'frame; and where they found three or four words together that might make\\n', 'part of a sentence, they dictated to the four remaining boys, who were\\n', 'scribes.  This work was repeated three or four times, and at every turn,\\n', 'the engine was so contrived, that the words shifted into new places, as\\n', 'the square bits of wood moved upside down.\\n', '\\n', '                           [Picture: The frame]\\n', '\\n', 'Six hours a day the young students were employed in this labour; and the\\n', 'professor showed me several volumes in large folio, already collected, of\\n', 'broken sentences, which he intended to piece together, and out of those\\n', 'rich materials, to give the world a complete body of all arts and\\n', 'sciences; which, however, might be still improved, and much expedited, if\\n', 'the public would raise a fund for making and employing five hundred such\\n', 'frames in Lagado, and oblige the managers to contribute in common their\\n', 'several collections.\\n', '\\n', 'He assured me “that this invention had employed all his thoughts from his\\n', 'youth; that he had emptied the whole vocabulary into his frame, and made\\n', 'the strictest computation of the general proportion there is in books\\n', 'between the numbers of particles, nouns, and verbs, and other parts of\\n', 'speech.”\\n', '\\n', 'I made my humblest acknowledgment to this illustrious person, for his\\n', 'great communicativeness; and promised, “if ever I had the good fortune to\\n', 'return to my native country, that I would do him justice, as the sole\\n', 'inventor of this wonderful machine;” the form and contrivance of which I\\n', 'desired leave to delineate on paper, as in the figure here annexed.  I\\n', 'told him, “although it were the custom of our learned in Europe to steal\\n', 'inventions from each other, who had thereby at least this advantage, that\\n', 'it became a controversy which was the right owner; yet I would take such\\n', 'caution, that he should have the honour entire, without a rival.”\\n', '\\n', 'We next went to the school of languages, where three professors sat in\\n', 'consultation upon improving that of their own country.\\n', '\\n', 'The first project was, to shorten discourse, by cutting polysyllables\\n', 'into one, and leaving out verbs and participles, because, in reality, all\\n', 'things imaginable are but norms.\\n', '\\n', 'The other project was, a scheme for entirely abolishing all words\\n', 'whatsoever; and this was urged as a great advantage in point of health,\\n', 'as well as brevity.  For it is plain, that every word we speak is, in\\n', 'some degree, a diminution of our lunge by corrosion, and, consequently,\\n', 'contributes to the shortening of our lives.  An expedient was therefore\\n', 'offered, “that since words are only names for things, it would be more\\n', 'convenient for all men to carry about them such things as were necessary\\n', 'to express a particular business they are to discourse on.”  And this\\n', 'invention would certainly have taken place, to the great ease as well as\\n', 'health of the subject, if the women, in conjunction with the vulgar and\\n', 'illiterate, had not threatened to raise a rebellion unless they might be\\n', 'allowed the liberty to speak with their tongues, after the manner of\\n', 'their forefathers; such constant irreconcilable enemies to science are\\n', 'the common people.  However, many of the most learned and wise adhere to\\n', 'the new scheme of expressing themselves by things; which has only this\\n', 'inconvenience attending it, that if a man’s business be very great, and\\n', 'of various kinds, he must be obliged, in proportion, to carry a greater\\n', 'bundle of things upon his back, unless he can afford one or two strong\\n', 'servants to attend him.  I have often beheld two of those sages almost\\n', 'sinking under the weight of their packs, like pedlars among us, who, when\\n', 'they met in the street, would lay down their loads, open their sacks, and\\n', 'hold conversation for an hour together; then put up their implements,\\n', 'help each other to resume their burdens, and take their leave.\\n', '\\n', 'But for short conversations, a man may carry implements in his pockets,\\n', 'and under his arms, enough to supply him; and in his house, he cannot be\\n', 'at a loss.  Therefore the room where company meet who practise this art,\\n', 'is full of all things, ready at hand, requisite to furnish matter for\\n', 'this kind of artificial converse.\\n', '\\n', 'Another great advantage proposed by this invention was, that it would\\n', 'serve as a universal language, to be understood in all civilised nations,\\n', 'whose goods and utensils are generally of the same kind, or nearly\\n', 'resembling, so that their uses might easily be comprehended.  And thus\\n', 'ambassadors would be qualified to treat with foreign princes, or\\n', 'ministers of state, to whose tongues they were utter strangers.\\n', '\\n', 'I was at the mathematical school, where the master taught his pupils\\n', 'after a method scarce imaginable to us in Europe.  The proposition, and\\n', 'demonstration, were fairly written on a thin wafer, with ink composed of\\n', 'a cephalic tincture.  This, the student was to swallow upon a fasting\\n', 'stomach, and for three days following, eat nothing but bread and water.\\n', 'As the wafer digested, the tincture mounted to his brain, bearing the\\n', 'proposition along with it.  But the success has not hitherto been\\n', 'answerable, partly by some error in the _quantum_ or composition, and\\n', 'partly by the perverseness of lads, to whom this bolus is so nauseous,\\n', 'that they generally steal aside, and discharge it upwards, before it can\\n', 'operate; neither have they been yet persuaded to use so long an\\n', 'abstinence, as the prescription requires.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER VI.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'A further account of the academy.  The author proposes some improvements,\\n', 'which are honourably received.\\n', '\\n', 'In the school of political projectors, I was but ill entertained; the\\n', 'professors appearing, in my judgment, wholly out of their senses, which\\n', 'is a scene that never fails to make me melancholy.  These unhappy people\\n', 'were proposing schemes for persuading monarchs to choose favourites upon\\n', 'the score of their wisdom, capacity, and virtue; of teaching ministers to\\n', 'consult the public good; of rewarding merit, great abilities, eminent\\n', 'services; of instructing princes to know their true interest, by placing\\n', 'it on the same foundation with that of their people; of choosing for\\n', 'employments persons qualified to exercise them, with many other wild,\\n', 'impossible chimeras, that never entered before into the heart of man to\\n', 'conceive; and confirmed in me the old observation, “that there is nothing\\n', 'so extravagant and irrational, which some philosophers have not\\n', 'maintained for truth.”\\n', '\\n', 'But, however, I shall so far do justice to this part of the Academy, as\\n', 'to acknowledge that all of them were not so visionary.  There was a most\\n', 'ingenious doctor, who seemed to be perfectly versed in the whole nature\\n', 'and system of government.  This illustrious person had very usefully\\n', 'employed his studies, in finding out effectual remedies for all diseases\\n', 'and corruptions to which the several kinds of public administration are\\n', 'subject, by the vices or infirmities of those who govern, as well as by\\n', 'the licentiousness of those who are to obey.  For instance: whereas all\\n', 'writers and reasoners have agreed, that there is a strict universal\\n', 'resemblance between the natural and the political body; can there be any\\n', 'thing more evident, than that the health of both must be preserved, and\\n', 'the diseases cured, by the same prescriptions?  It is allowed, that\\n', 'senates and great councils are often troubled with redundant, ebullient,\\n', 'and other peccant humours; with many diseases of the head, and more of\\n', 'the heart; with strong convulsions, with grievous contractions of the\\n', 'nerves and sinews in both hands, but especially the right; with spleen,\\n', 'flatus, vertigos, and deliriums; with scrofulous tumours, full of fetid\\n', 'purulent matter; with sour frothy ructations: with canine appetites, and\\n', 'crudeness of digestion, besides many others, needless to mention.  This\\n', 'doctor therefore proposed, “that upon the meeting of the senate, certain\\n', 'physicians should attend it the three first days of their sitting, and at\\n', 'the close of each day’s debate feel the pulses of every senator; after\\n', 'which, having maturely considered and consulted upon the nature of the\\n', 'several maladies, and the methods of cure, they should on the fourth day\\n', 'return to the senate house, attended by their apothecaries stored with\\n', 'proper medicines; and before the members sat, administer to each of them\\n', 'lenitives, aperitives, abstersives, corrosives, restringents,\\n', 'palliatives, laxatives, cephalalgics, icterics, apophlegmatics,\\n', 'acoustics, as their several cases required; and, according as these\\n', 'medicines should operate, repeat, alter, or omit them, at the next\\n', 'meeting.”\\n', '\\n', 'This project could not be of any great expense to the public; and might\\n', 'in my poor opinion, be of much use for the despatch of business, in those\\n', 'countries where senates have any share in the legislative power; beget\\n', 'unanimity, shorten debates, open a few mouths which are now closed, and\\n', 'close many more which are now open; curb the petulancy of the young, and\\n', 'correct the positiveness of the old; rouse the stupid, and damp the pert.\\n', '\\n', 'Again: because it is a general complaint, that the favourites of princes\\n', 'are troubled with short and weak memories; the same doctor proposed,\\n', '“that whoever attended a first minister, after having told his business,\\n', 'with the utmost brevity and in the plainest words, should, at his\\n', 'departure, give the said minister a tweak by the nose, or a kick in the\\n', 'belly, or tread on his corns, or lug him thrice by both ears, or run a\\n', 'pin into his breech; or pinch his arm black and blue, to prevent\\n', 'forgetfulness; and at every levee day, repeat the same operation, till\\n', 'the business were done, or absolutely refused.”\\n', '\\n', 'He likewise directed, “that every senator in the great council of a\\n', 'nation, after he had delivered his opinion, and argued in the defence of\\n', 'it, should be obliged to give his vote directly contrary; because if that\\n', 'were done, the result would infallibly terminate in the good of the\\n', 'public.”\\n', '\\n', 'When parties in a state are violent, he offered a wonderful contrivance\\n', 'to reconcile them.  The method is this: You take a hundred leaders of\\n', 'each party; you dispose them into couples of such whose heads are nearest\\n', 'of a size; then let two nice operators saw off the occiput of each couple\\n', 'at the same time, in such a manner that the brain may be equally divided.\\n', 'Let the occiputs, thus cut off, be interchanged, applying each to the\\n', 'head of his opposite party-man.  It seems indeed to be a work that\\n', 'requires some exactness, but the professor assured us, “that if it were\\n', 'dexterously performed, the cure would be infallible.”  For he argued\\n', 'thus: “that the two half brains being left to debate the matter between\\n', 'themselves within the space of one skull, would soon come to a good\\n', 'understanding, and produce that moderation, as well as regularity of\\n', 'thinking, so much to be wished for in the heads of those, who imagine\\n', 'they come into the world only to watch and govern its motion: and as to\\n', 'the difference of brains, in quantity or quality, among those who are\\n', 'directors in faction, the doctor assured us, from his own knowledge, that\\n', '“it was a perfect trifle.”\\n', '\\n', 'I heard a very warm debate between two professors, about the most\\n', 'commodious and effectual ways and means of raising money, without\\n', 'grieving the subject.  The first affirmed, “the justest method would be,\\n', 'to lay a certain tax upon vices and folly; and the sum fixed upon every\\n', 'man to be rated, after the fairest manner, by a jury of his neighbours.”\\n', 'The second was of an opinion directly contrary; “to tax those qualities\\n', 'of body and mind, for which men chiefly value themselves; the rate to be\\n', 'more or less, according to the degrees of excelling; the decision whereof\\n', 'should be left entirely to their own breast.”  The highest tax was upon\\n', 'men who are the greatest favourites of the other sex, and the\\n', 'assessments, according to the number and nature of the favours they have\\n', 'received; for which, they are allowed to be their own vouchers.  Wit,\\n', 'valour, and politeness, were likewise proposed to be largely taxed, and\\n', 'collected in the same manner, by every person’s giving his own word for\\n', 'the quantum of what he possessed.  But as to honour, justice, wisdom, and\\n', 'learning, they should not be taxed at all; because they are\\n', 'qualifications of so singular a kind, that no man will either allow them\\n', 'in his neighbour or value them in himself.\\n', '\\n', 'The women were proposed to be taxed according to their beauty and skill\\n', 'in dressing, wherein they had the same privilege with the men, to be\\n', 'determined by their own judgment.  But constancy, chastity, good sense,\\n', 'and good nature, were not rated, because they would not bear the charge\\n', 'of collecting.\\n', '\\n', 'To keep senators in the interest of the crown, it was proposed that the\\n', 'members should raffle for employment; every man first taking an oath, and\\n', 'giving security, that he would vote for the court, whether he won or not;\\n', 'after which, the losers had, in their turn, the liberty of raffling upon\\n', 'the next vacancy.  Thus, hope and expectation would be kept alive; none\\n', 'would complain of broken promises, but impute their disappointments\\n', 'wholly to fortune, whose shoulders are broader and stronger than those of\\n', 'a ministry.\\n', '\\n', 'Another professor showed me a large paper of instructions for discovering\\n', 'plots and conspiracies against the government.  He advised great\\n', 'statesmen to examine into the diet of all suspected persons; their times\\n', 'of eating; upon which side they lay in bed; with which hand they wipe\\n', 'their posteriors; take a strict view of their excrements, and, from the\\n', 'colour, the odour, the taste, the consistence, the crudeness or maturity\\n', 'of digestion, form a judgment of their thoughts and designs; because men\\n', 'are never so serious, thoughtful, and intent, as when they are at stool,\\n', 'which he found by frequent experiment; for, in such conjunctures, when he\\n', 'used, merely as a trial, to consider which was the best way of murdering\\n', 'the king, his ordure would have a tincture of green; but quite different,\\n', 'when he thought only of raising an insurrection, or burning the\\n', 'metropolis.\\n', '\\n', 'The whole discourse was written with great acuteness, containing many\\n', 'observations, both curious and useful for politicians; but, as I\\n', 'conceived, not altogether complete.  This I ventured to tell the author,\\n', 'and offered, if he pleased, to supply him with some additions.  He\\n', 'received my proposition with more compliance than is usual among writers,\\n', 'especially those of the projecting species, professing “he would be glad\\n', 'to receive further information.”\\n', '\\n', 'I told him, “that in the kingdom of Tribnia, {454a} by the natives called\\n', 'Langdon, {454b} where I had sojourned some time in my travels, the bulk\\n', 'of the people consist in a manner wholly of discoverers, witnesses,\\n', 'informers, accusers, prosecutors, evidences, swearers, together with\\n', 'their several subservient and subaltern instruments, all under the\\n', 'colours, the conduct, and the pay of ministers of state, and their\\n', 'deputies.  The plots, in that kingdom, are usually the workmanship of\\n', 'those persons who desire to raise their own characters of profound\\n', 'politicians; to restore new vigour to a crazy administration; to stifle\\n', 'or divert general discontents; to fill their coffers with forfeitures;\\n', 'and raise, or sink the opinion of public credit, as either shall best\\n', 'answer their private advantage.  It is first agreed and settled among\\n', 'them, what suspected persons shall be accused of a plot; then, effectual\\n', 'care is taken to secure all their letters and papers, and put the owners\\n', 'in chains.  These papers are delivered to a set of artists, very\\n', 'dexterous in finding out the mysterious meanings of words, syllables, and\\n', 'letters: for instance, they can discover a close stool, to signify a\\n', 'privy council; a flock of geese, a senate; a lame dog, an invader; the\\n', 'plague, a standing army; a buzzard, a prime minister; the gout, a high\\n', 'priest; a gibbet, a secretary of state; a chamber pot, a committee of\\n', 'grandees; a sieve, a court lady; a broom, a revolution; a mouse-trap, an\\n', 'employment; a bottomless pit, a treasury; a sink, a court; a cap and\\n', 'bells, a favourite; a broken reed, a court of justice; an empty tun, a\\n', 'general; a running sore, the administration. {455}\\n', '\\n', '“When this method fails, they have two others more effectual, which the\\n', 'learned among them call acrostics and anagrams.  First, they can decipher\\n', 'all initial letters into political meanings.  Thus _N_, shall signify a\\n', 'plot; _B_, a regiment of horse; _L_, a fleet at sea; or, secondly, by\\n', 'transposing the letters of the alphabet in any suspected paper, they can\\n', 'lay open the deepest designs of a discontented party.  So, for example,\\n', 'if I should say, in a letter to a friend, ‘Our brother Tom has just got\\n', 'the piles,’ a skilful decipherer would discover, that the same letters\\n', 'which compose that sentence, may be analysed into the following words,\\n', '‘Resist ---, a plot is brought home—The tour.’  And this is the\\n', 'anagrammatic method.”\\n', '\\n', 'The professor made me great acknowledgments for communicating these\\n', 'observations, and promised to make honourable mention of me in his\\n', 'treatise.\\n', '\\n', 'I saw nothing in this country that could invite me to a longer\\n', 'continuance, and began to think of returning home to England.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER VII.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The author leaves Lagado: arrives at Maldonada.  No ship ready.  He takes\\n', 'a short voyage to Glubbdubdrib.  His reception by the governor.\\n', '\\n', 'The continent, of which this kingdom is apart, extends itself, as I have\\n', 'reason to believe, eastward, to that unknown tract of America westward of\\n', 'California; and north, to the Pacific Ocean, which is not above a hundred\\n', 'and fifty miles from Lagado; where there is a good port, and much\\n', 'commerce with the great island of Luggnagg, situated to the north-west\\n', 'about 29 degrees north latitude, and 140 longitude.  This island of\\n', 'Luggnagg stands south-eastward of Japan, about a hundred leagues distant.\\n', 'There is a strict alliance between the Japanese emperor and the king of\\n', 'Luggnagg; which affords frequent opportunities of sailing from one island\\n', 'to the other.  I determined therefore to direct my course this way, in\\n', 'order to my return to Europe.  I hired two mules, with a guide, to show\\n', 'me the way, and carry my small baggage.  I took leave of my noble\\n', 'protector, who had shown me so much favour, and made me a generous\\n', 'present at my departure.\\n', '\\n', 'My journey was without any accident or adventure worth relating.  When I\\n', 'arrived at the port of Maldonada (for so it is called) there was no ship\\n', 'in the harbour bound for Luggnagg, nor likely to be in some time.  The\\n', 'town is about as large as Portsmouth.  I soon fell into some\\n', 'acquaintance, and was very hospitably received.  A gentleman of\\n', 'distinction said to me, “that since the ships bound for Luggnagg could\\n', 'not be ready in less than a month, it might be no disagreeable amusement\\n', 'for me to take a trip to the little island of Glubbdubdrib, about five\\n', 'leagues off to the south-west.”  He offered himself and a friend to\\n', 'accompany me, and that I should be provided with a small convenient bark\\n', 'for the voyage.\\n', '\\n', 'Glubbdubdrib, as nearly as I can interpret the word, signifies the island\\n', 'of sorcerers or magicians.  It is about one third as large as the Isle of\\n', 'Wight, and extremely fruitful: it is governed by the head of a certain\\n', 'tribe, who are all magicians.  This tribe marries only among each other,\\n', 'and the eldest in succession is prince or governor.  He has a noble\\n', 'palace, and a park of about three thousand acres, surrounded by a wall of\\n', 'hewn stone twenty feet high.  In this park are several small enclosures\\n', 'for cattle, corn, and gardening.\\n', '\\n', 'The governor and his family are served and attended by domestics of a\\n', 'kind somewhat unusual.  By his skill in necromancy he has a power of\\n', 'calling whom he pleases from the dead, and commanding their service for\\n', 'twenty-four hours, but no longer; nor can he call the same persons up\\n', 'again in less than three months, except upon very extraordinary\\n', 'occasions.\\n', '\\n', 'When we arrived at the island, which was about eleven in the morning, one\\n', 'of the gentlemen who accompanied me went to the governor, and desired\\n', 'admittance for a stranger, who came on purpose to have the honour of\\n', 'attending on his highness.  This was immediately granted, and we all\\n', 'three entered the gate of the palace between two rows of guards, armed\\n', 'and dressed after a very antic manner, and with something in their\\n', 'countenances that made my flesh creep with a horror I cannot express.  We\\n', 'passed through several apartments, between servants of the same sort,\\n', 'ranked on each side as before, till we came to the chamber of presence;\\n', 'where, after three profound obeisances, and a few general questions, we\\n', 'were permitted to sit on three stools, near the lowest step of his\\n', 'highness’s throne.  He understood the language of Balnibarbi, although it\\n', 'was different from that of this island.  He desired me to give him some\\n', 'account of my travels; and, to let me see that I should be treated\\n', 'without ceremony, he dismissed all his attendants with a turn of his\\n', 'finger; at which, to my great astonishment, they vanished in an instant,\\n', 'like visions in a dream when we awake on a sudden.  I could not recover\\n', 'myself in some time, till the governor assured me, “that I should receive\\n', 'no hurt:” and observing my two companions to be under no concern, who had\\n', 'been often entertained in the same manner, I began to take courage, and\\n', 'related to his highness a short history of my several adventures; yet not\\n', 'without some hesitation, and frequently looking behind me to the place\\n', 'where I had seen those domestic spectres.  I had the honour to dine with\\n', 'the governor, where a new set of ghosts served up the meat, and waited at\\n', 'table.  I now observed myself to be less terrified than I had been in the\\n', 'morning.  I stayed till sunset, but humbly desired his highness to excuse\\n', 'me for not accepting his invitation of lodging in the palace.  My two\\n', 'friends and I lay at a private house in the town adjoining, which is the\\n', 'capital of this little island; and the next morning we returned to pay\\n', 'our duty to the governor, as he was pleased to command us.\\n', '\\n', 'After this manner we continued in the island for ten days, most part of\\n', 'every day with the governor, and at night in our lodging.  I soon grew so\\n', 'familiarized to the sight of spirits, that after the third or fourth time\\n', 'they gave me no emotion at all: or, if I had any apprehensions left, my\\n', 'curiosity prevailed over them.  For his highness the governor ordered me\\n', '“to call up whatever persons I would choose to name, and in whatever\\n', 'numbers, among all the dead from the beginning of the world to the\\n', 'present time, and command them to answer any questions I should think fit\\n', 'to ask; with this condition, that my questions must be confined within\\n', 'the compass of the times they lived in.  And one thing I might depend\\n', 'upon, that they would certainly tell me the truth, for lying was a talent\\n', 'of no use in the lower world.”\\n', '\\n', 'I made my humble acknowledgments to his highness for so great a favour.\\n', 'We were in a chamber, from whence there was a fair prospect into the\\n', 'park.  And because my first inclination was to be entertained with scenes\\n', 'of pomp and magnificence, I desired to see Alexander the Great at the\\n', 'head of his army, just after the battle of Arbela: which, upon a motion\\n', 'of the governor’s finger, immediately appeared in a large field, under\\n', 'the window where we stood.  Alexander was called up into the room: it was\\n', 'with great difficulty that I understood his Greek, and had but little of\\n', 'my own.  He assured me upon his honour “that he was not poisoned, but\\n', 'died of a bad fever by excessive drinking.”\\n', '\\n', 'Next, I saw Hannibal passing the Alps, who told me “he had not a drop of\\n', 'vinegar in his camp.”\\n', '\\n', 'I saw Cæsar and Pompey at the head of their troops, just ready to engage.\\n', 'I saw the former, in his last great triumph.  I desired that the senate\\n', 'of Rome might appear before me, in one large chamber, and an assembly of\\n', 'somewhat a later age in counterview, in another.  The first seemed to be\\n', 'an assembly of heroes and demigods; the other, a knot of pedlars,\\n', 'pick-pockets, highwayman, and bullies.\\n', '\\n', 'The governor, at my request, gave the sign for Cæsar and Brutus to\\n', 'advance towards us.  I was struck with a profound veneration at the sight\\n', 'of Brutus, and could easily discover the most consummate virtue, the\\n', 'greatest intrepidity and firmness of mind, the truest love of his\\n', 'country, and general benevolence for mankind, in every lineament of his\\n', 'countenance.  I observed, with much pleasure, that these two persons were\\n', 'in good intelligence with each other; and Cæsar freely confessed to me,\\n', '“that the greatest actions of his own life were not equal, by many\\n', 'degrees, to the glory of taking it away.”  I had the honour to have much\\n', 'conversation with Brutus; and was told, “that his ancestor Junius,\\n', 'Socrates, Epaminondas, Cato the younger, Sir Thomas More, and himself\\n', 'were perpetually together:” a sextumvirate, to which all the ages of the\\n', 'world cannot add a seventh.\\n', '\\n', 'It would be tedious to trouble the reader with relating what vast numbers\\n', 'of illustrious persons were called up to gratify that insatiable desire I\\n', 'had to see the world in every period of antiquity placed before me.  I\\n', 'chiefly fed mine eyes with beholding the destroyers of tyrants and\\n', 'usurpers, and the restorers of liberty to oppressed and injured nations.\\n', 'But it is impossible to express the satisfaction I received in my own\\n', 'mind, after such a manner as to make it a suitable entertainment to the\\n', 'reader.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER VIII.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'A further account of Glubbdubdrib.  Ancient and modern history corrected.\\n', '\\n', 'Having a desire to see those ancients who were most renowned for wit and\\n', 'learning, I set apart one day on purpose.  I proposed that Homer and\\n', 'Aristotle might appear at the head of all their commentators; but these\\n', 'were so numerous, that some hundreds were forced to attend in the court,\\n', 'and outward rooms of the palace.  I knew, and could distinguish those two\\n', 'heroes, at first sight, not only from the crowd, but from each other.\\n', 'Homer was the taller and comelier person of the two, walked very erect\\n', 'for one of his age, and his eyes were the most quick and piercing I ever\\n', 'beheld.  Aristotle stooped much, and made use of a staff.  His visage was\\n', 'meagre, his hair lank and thin, and his voice hollow.  I soon discovered\\n', 'that both of them were perfect strangers to the rest of the company, and\\n', 'had never seen or heard of them before; and I had a whisper from a ghost\\n', 'who shall be nameless, “that these commentators always kept in the most\\n', 'distant quarters from their principals, in the lower world, through a\\n', 'consciousness of shame and guilt, because they had so horribly\\n', 'misrepresented the meaning of those authors to posterity.”  I introduced\\n', 'Didymus and Eustathius to Homer, and prevailed on him to treat them\\n', 'better than perhaps they deserved, for he soon found they wanted a genius\\n', 'to enter into the spirit of a poet.  But Aristotle was out of all\\n', 'patience with the account I gave him of Scotus and Ramus, as I presented\\n', 'them to him; and he asked them, “whether the rest of the tribe were as\\n', 'great dunces as themselves?”\\n', '\\n', 'I then desired the governor to call up Descartes and Gassendi, with whom\\n', 'I prevailed to explain their systems to Aristotle.  This great\\n', 'philosopher freely acknowledged his own mistakes in natural philosophy,\\n', 'because he proceeded in many things upon conjecture, as all men must do;\\n', 'and he found that Gassendi, who had made the doctrine of Epicurus as\\n', 'palatable as he could, and the vortices of Descartes, were equally to be\\n', 'exploded.  He predicted the same fate to _attraction_, whereof the\\n', 'present learned are such zealous asserters.  He said, “that new systems\\n', 'of nature were but new fashions, which would vary in every age; and even\\n', 'those, who pretend to demonstrate them from mathematical principles,\\n', 'would flourish but a short period of time, and be out of vogue when that\\n', 'was determined.”\\n', '\\n', 'I spent five days in conversing with many others of the ancient learned.\\n', 'I saw most of the first Roman emperors.  I prevailed on the governor to\\n', 'call up Heliogabalus’s cooks to dress us a dinner, but they could not\\n', 'show us much of their skill, for want of materials.  A helot of Agesilaus\\n', 'made us a dish of Spartan broth, but I was not able to get down a second\\n', 'spoonful.\\n', '\\n', 'The two gentlemen, who conducted me to the island, were pressed by their\\n', 'private affairs to return in three days, which I employed in seeing some\\n', 'of the modern dead, who had made the greatest figure, for two or three\\n', 'hundred years past, in our own and other countries of Europe; and having\\n', 'been always a great admirer of old illustrious families, I desired the\\n', 'governor would call up a dozen or two of kings, with their ancestors in\\n', 'order for eight or nine generations.  But my disappointment was grievous\\n', 'and unexpected.  For, instead of a long train with royal diadems, I saw\\n', 'in one family two fiddlers, three spruce courtiers, and an Italian\\n', 'prelate.  In another, a barber, an abbot, and two cardinals.  I have too\\n', 'great a veneration for crowned heads, to dwell any longer on so nice a\\n', 'subject.  But as to counts, marquises, dukes, earls, and the like, I was\\n', 'not so scrupulous.  And I confess, it was not without some pleasure, that\\n', 'I found myself able to trace the particular features, by which certain\\n', 'families are distinguished, up to their originals.  I could plainly\\n', 'discover whence one family derives a long chin; why a second has abounded\\n', 'with knaves for two generations, and fools for two more; why a third\\n', 'happened to be crack-brained, and a fourth to be sharpers; whence it\\n', 'came, what Polydore Virgil says of a certain great house, _Nec vir\\n', 'fortis_, _nec foemina casta_; how cruelty, falsehood, and cowardice, grew\\n', 'to be characteristics by which certain families are distinguished as much\\n', 'as by their coats of arms; who first brought the pox into a noble house,\\n', 'which has lineally descended scrofulous tumours to their posterity.\\n', 'Neither could I wonder at all this, when I saw such an interruption of\\n', 'lineages, by pages, lackeys, valets, coachmen, gamesters, fiddlers,\\n', 'players, captains, and pickpockets.\\n', '\\n', 'I was chiefly disgusted with modern history.  For having strictly\\n', 'examined all the persons of greatest name in the courts of princes, for a\\n', 'hundred years past, I found how the world had been misled by prostitute\\n', 'writers, to ascribe the greatest exploits in war, to cowards; the wisest\\n', 'counsel, to fools; sincerity, to flatterers; Roman virtue, to betrayers\\n', 'of their country; piety, to atheists; chastity, to sodomites; truth, to\\n', 'informers: how many innocent and excellent persons had been condemned to\\n', 'death or banishment by the practising of great ministers upon the\\n', 'corruption of judges, and the malice of factions: how many villains had\\n', 'been exalted to the highest places of trust, power, dignity, and profit:\\n', 'how great a share in the motions and events of courts, councils, and\\n', 'senates might be challenged by bawds, whores, pimps, parasites, and\\n', 'buffoons.  How low an opinion I had of human wisdom and integrity, when I\\n', 'was truly informed of the springs and motives of great enterprises and\\n', 'revolutions in the world, and of the contemptible accidents to which they\\n', 'owed their success.\\n', '\\n', 'Here I discovered the roguery and ignorance of those who pretend to write\\n', 'anecdotes, or secret history; who send so many kings to their graves with\\n', 'a cup of poison; will repeat the discourse between a prince and chief\\n', 'minister, where no witness was by; unlock the thoughts and cabinets of\\n', 'ambassadors and secretaries of state; and have the perpetual misfortune\\n', 'to be mistaken.  Here I discovered the true causes of many great events\\n', 'that have surprised the world; how a whore can govern the back-stairs,\\n', 'the back-stairs a council, and the council a senate.  A general\\n', 'confessed, in my presence, “that he got a victory purely by the force of\\n', 'cowardice and ill conduct;” and an admiral, “that, for want of proper\\n', 'intelligence, he beat the enemy, to whom he intended to betray the\\n', 'fleet.”  Three kings protested to me, “that in their whole reigns they\\n', 'never did once prefer any person of merit, unless by mistake, or\\n', 'treachery of some minister in whom they confided; neither would they do\\n', 'it if they were to live again:” and they showed, with great strength of\\n', 'reason, “that the royal throne could not be supported without corruption,\\n', 'because that positive, confident, restiff temper, which virtue infused\\n', 'into a man, was a perpetual clog to public business.”\\n', '\\n', 'I had the curiosity to inquire in a particular manner, by what methods\\n', 'great numbers had procured to themselves high titles of honour, and\\n', 'prodigious estates; and I confined my inquiry to a very modern period:\\n', 'however, without grating upon present times, because I would be sure to\\n', 'give no offence even to foreigners (for I hope the reader need not be\\n', 'told, that I do not in the least intend my own country, in what I say\\n', 'upon this occasion,) a great number of persons concerned were called up;\\n', 'and, upon a very slight examination, discovered such a scene of infamy,\\n', 'that I cannot reflect upon it without some seriousness.  Perjury,\\n', 'oppression, subornation, fraud, pandarism, and the like infirmities, were\\n', 'among the most excusable arts they had to mention; and for these I gave,\\n', 'as it was reasonable, great allowance.  But when some confessed they owed\\n', 'their greatness and wealth to sodomy, or incest; others, to the\\n', 'prostituting of their own wives and daughters; others, to the betraying\\n', 'of their country or their prince; some, to poisoning; more to the\\n', 'perverting of justice, in order to destroy the innocent, I hope I may be\\n', 'pardoned, if these discoveries inclined me a little to abate of that\\n', 'profound veneration, which I am naturally apt to pay to persons of high\\n', 'rank, who ought to be treated with the utmost respect due to their\\n', 'sublime dignity, by us their inferiors.\\n', '\\n', 'I had often read of some great services done to princes and states, and\\n', 'desired to see the persons by whom those services were performed.  Upon\\n', 'inquiry I was told, “that their names were to be found on no record,\\n', 'except a few of them, whom history has represented as the vilest of\\n', 'rogues and traitors.”  As to the rest, I had never once heard of them.\\n', 'They all appeared with dejected looks, and in the meanest habit; most of\\n', 'them telling me, “they died in poverty and disgrace, and the rest on a\\n', 'scaffold or a gibbet.”\\n', '\\n', 'Among others, there was one person, whose case appeared a little\\n', 'singular.  He had a youth about eighteen years old standing by his side.\\n', 'He told me, “he had for many years been commander of a ship; and in the\\n', 'sea fight at Actium had the good fortune to break through the enemy’s\\n', 'great line of battle, sink three of their capital ships, and take a\\n', 'fourth, which was the sole cause of Antony’s flight, and of the victory\\n', 'that ensued; that the youth standing by him, his only son, was killed in\\n', 'the action.”  He added, “that upon the confidence of some merit, the war\\n', 'being at an end, he went to Rome, and solicited at the court of Augustus\\n', 'to be preferred to a greater ship, whose commander had been killed; but,\\n', 'without any regard to his pretensions, it was given to a boy who had\\n', 'never seen the sea, the son of Libertina, who waited on one of the\\n', 'emperor’s mistresses.  Returning back to his own vessel, he was charged\\n', 'with neglect of duty, and the ship given to a favourite page of\\n', 'Publicola, the vice-admiral; whereupon he retired to a poor farm at a\\n', 'great distance from Rome, and there ended his life.”  I was so curious to\\n', 'know the truth of this story, that I desired Agrippa might be called, who\\n', 'was admiral in that fight.  He appeared, and confirmed the whole account:\\n', 'but with much more advantage to the captain, whose modesty had extenuated\\n', 'or concealed a great part of his merit.\\n', '\\n', 'I was surprised to find corruption grown so high and so quick in that\\n', 'empire, by the force of luxury so lately introduced; which made me less\\n', 'wonder at many parallel cases in other countries, where vices of all\\n', 'kinds have reigned so much longer, and where the whole praise, as well as\\n', 'pillage, has been engrossed by the chief commander, who perhaps had the\\n', 'least title to either.\\n', '\\n', 'As every person called up made exactly the same appearance he had done in\\n', 'the world, it gave me melancholy reflections to observe how much the race\\n', 'of human kind was degenerated among us within these hundred years past;\\n', 'how the pox, under all its consequences and denominations had altered\\n', 'every lineament of an English countenance; shortened the size of bodies,\\n', 'unbraced the nerves, relaxed the sinews and muscles, introduced a sallow\\n', 'complexion, and rendered the flesh loose and rancid.\\n', '\\n', 'I descended so low, as to desire some English yeoman of the old stamp\\n', 'might be summoned to appear; once so famous for the simplicity of their\\n', 'manners, diet, and dress; for justice in their dealings; for their true\\n', 'spirit of liberty; for their valour, and love of their country.  Neither\\n', 'could I be wholly unmoved, after comparing the living with the dead, when\\n', 'I considered how all these pure native virtues were prostituted for a\\n', 'piece of money by their grand-children; who, in selling their votes and\\n', 'managing at elections, have acquired every vice and corruption that can\\n', 'possibly be learned in a court.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER IX.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The author returns to Maldonada.

The two gentlemen, and some others, were so generous and\\n', 'kind as to furnish me with provisions, and see me on board.  I was a\\n', 'month in this voyage.  We had one violent storm, and were under a\\n', 'necessity of steering westward to get into the trade wind, which holds\\n', 'for above sixty leagues.  On the 21st of April, 1708, we sailed into the\\n', 'river of Clumegnig, which is a seaport town, at the south-east point of\\n', 'Luggnagg.

This officer spoke to me in the language of\\n', 'Balnibarbi, which, by the force of much commerce, is generally understood\\n', 'in that town, especially by seamen and those employed in the customs.  I\\n', 'gave him a short account of some particulars, and made my story as\\n', 'plausible and consistent as I could; but I thought it necessary to\\n', 'disguise my country, and call myself a Hollander; because my intentions\\n', 'were for Japan, and I knew the Dutch were the only Europeans permitted to\\n', 'enter into that kingdom.  I therefore told the officer, “that having been\\n', 'shipwrecked on the coast of Balnibarbi, and cast on a rock, I was\\n', 'received up into Laputa, or the flying island (of which he had often\\n', 'heard), and was now endeavouring to get to Japan, whence I might find a\\n', 'convenience of returning to my own country.”  The officer said, “I must\\n', 'be confined till he could receive orders from court, for which he would\\n', 'write immediately, and hoped to receive an answer in a fortnight.”  I was\\n', 'carried to a convenient lodging with a sentry placed at the door;\\n', 'however, I had the liberty of a large garden, and was treated with\\n', 'humanity enough, being maintained all the time at the king’s charge.  I\\n', 'was invited by several persons, chiefly out of curiosity, because it was\\n', 'reported that I came from countries very remote, of which they had never\\n', 'heard.\\n', '\\n', 'I hired a young man, who came in the same ship, to be an interpreter; he\\n', 'was a native of Luggnagg, but had lived some years at Maldonada, and was\\n', 'a perfect master of both languages.

All my retinue was that poor lad for\\n', 'an interpreter, whom I persuaded into my service, and, at my humble\\n', 'request, we had each of us a mule to ride on.  A messenger was despatched\\n', 'half a day’s journey before us, to give the king notice of my approach,\\n', 'and to desire, “that his majesty would please to appoint a day and hour,\\n', 'when it would by his gracious pleasure that I might have the honour to\\n', 'lick the dust before his footstool.”  This is the court style, and I\\n', 'found it to be more than matter of form: for, upon my admittance two days\\n', 'after my arrival, I was commanded to crawl upon my belly, and lick the\\n', 'floor as I advanced; but, on account of my being a stranger, care was\\n', 'taken to have it made so clean, that the dust was not offensive.\\n', 'However, this was a peculiar grace, not allowed to any but persons of the\\n', 'highest rank, when they desire an admittance.  Nay, sometimes the floor\\n', 'is strewed with dust on purpose, when the person to be admitted happens\\n', 'to have powerful enemies at court; and I have seen a great lord with his\\n', 'mouth so crammed, that when he had crept to the proper distance from the\\n', 'throne; he was not able to speak a word.  Neither is there any remedy;\\n', 'because it is capital for those, who receive an audience to spit or wipe\\n', 'their mouths in his majesty’s presence.  There is indeed another custom,\\n', 'which I cannot altogether approve of: when the king has a mind to put any\\n', 'of his nobles to death in a gentle indulgent manner, he commands the\\n', 'floor to be strewed with a certain brown powder of a deadly composition,\\n', 'which being licked up, infallibly kills him in twenty-four hours.  But in\\n', 'justice to this prince’s great clemency, and the care he has of his\\n', 'subjects’ lives (wherein it were much to be wished that the Monarchs of\\n', 'Europe would imitate him), it must be mentioned for his honour, that\\n', 'strict orders are given to have the infected parts of the floor well\\n', 'washed after every such execution, which, if his domestics neglect, they\\n', 'are in danger of incurring his royal displeasure.  I myself heard him\\n', 'give directions, that one of his pages should be whipped, whose turn it\\n', 'was to give notice about washing the floor after an execution, but\\n', 'maliciously had omitted it; by which neglect a young lord of great hopes,\\n', 'coming to an audience, was unfortunately poisoned, although the king at\\n', 'that time had no design against his life.  But this good prince was so\\n', 'gracious as to forgive the poor page his whipping, upon promise that he\\n', 'would do so no more, without special orders.\\n', '\\n', 'To return from this digression.  When I had crept within four yards of\\n', 'the throne, I raised myself gently upon my knees, and then striking my\\n', 'forehead seven times against the ground, I pronounced the following\\n', 'words, as they had been taught me the night before, _Inckpling\\n', 'gloffthrobb squut serummblhiop mlashnalt zwin tnodbalkuffh slhiophad\\n', 'gurdlubh asht_.  This is the compliment, established by the laws of the\\n', 'land, for all persons admitted to the king’s presence.  It may be\\n', 'rendered into English thus: “May your celestial majesty outlive the sun,\\n', 'eleven moons and a half!”  To this the king returned some answer, which,\\n', 'although I could not understand, yet I replied as I had been directed:\\n', '_Fluft drin yalerick dwuldom prastrad mirpush_, which properly signifies,\\n', '“My tongue is in the mouth of my friend;” and by this expression was\\n', 'meant, that I desired leave to bring my interpreter; whereupon the young\\n', 'man already mentioned was accordingly introduced, by whose intervention I\\n', 'answered as many questions as his majesty could put in above an hour.  I\\n', 'spoke in the Balnibarbian tongue, and my interpreter delivered my meaning\\n', 'in that of Luggnagg.\\n', '\\n', 'The king was much delighted with my company, and ordered his\\n', '_bliffmarklub_, or high-chamberlain, to appoint a lodging in the court\\n', 'for me and my interpreter; with a daily allowance for my table, and a\\n', 'large purse of gold for my common expenses.\\n', '\\n', 'I staid three months in this country, out of perfect obedience to his\\n', 'majesty; who was pleased highly to favour me, and made me very honourable\\n', 'offers.  But I thought it more consistent with prudence and justice to\\n', 'pass the remainder of my days with my wife and family.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER X.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The Luggnaggians commended.  A particular description of the Struldbrugs,\\n', 'with many conversations between the author and some eminent persons upon\\n', 'that subject.\\n', '\\n', 'The Luggnaggians are a polite and generous people; and although they are\\n', 'not without some share of that pride which is peculiar to all Eastern\\n', 'countries, yet they show themselves courteous to strangers, especially\\n', 'such who are countenanced by the court.  I had many acquaintance, and\\n', 'among persons of the best fashion; and being always attended by my\\n', 'interpreter, the conversation we had was not disagreeable.\\n', '\\n', 'One day, in much good company, I was asked by a person of quality,\\n', '“whether I had seen any of their _struldbrugs_, or immortals?”  I said,\\n', '“I had not;” and desired he would explain to me “what he meant by such an\\n', 'appellation, applied to a mortal creature.”  He told me “that sometimes,\\n', 'though very rarely, a child happened to be born in a family, with a red\\n', 'circular spot in the forehead, directly over the left eyebrow, which was\\n', 'an infallible mark that it should never die.”  The spot, as he described\\n', 'it, “was about the compass of a silver threepence, but in the course of\\n', 'time grew larger, and changed its colour; for at twelve years old it\\n', 'became green, so continued till five and twenty, then turned to a deep\\n', 'blue: at five and forty it grew coal black, and as large as an English\\n', 'shilling; but never admitted any further alteration.”  He said, “these\\n', 'births were so rare, that he did not believe there could be above eleven\\n', 'hundred struldbrugs, of both sexes, in the whole kingdom; of which he\\n', 'computed about fifty in the metropolis, and, among the rest, a young girl\\n', 'born; about three years ago: that these productions were not peculiar to\\n', 'any family, but a mere effect of chance; and the children of the\\n', '_struldbrugs_ themselves were equally mortal with the rest of the\\n', 'people.”\\n', '\\n', 'I freely own myself to have been struck with inexpressible delight, upon\\n', 'hearing this account: and the person who gave it me happening to\\n', 'understand the Balnibarbian language, which I spoke very well, I could\\n', 'not forbear breaking out into expressions, perhaps a little too\\n', 'extravagant.  I cried out, as in a rapture, “Happy nation, where every\\n', 'child hath at least a chance for being immortal!  Happy people, who enjoy\\n', 'so many living examples of ancient virtue, and have masters ready to\\n', 'instruct them in the wisdom of all former ages! but happiest, beyond all\\n', 'comparison, are those excellent _struldbrugs_, who, being born exempt\\n', 'from that universal calamity of human nature, have their minds free and\\n', 'disengaged, without the weight and depression of spirits caused by the\\n', 'continual apprehensions of death!”  I discovered my admiration that I had\\n', 'not observed any of these illustrious persons at court; the black spot on\\n', 'the forehead being so remarkable a distinction, that I could not have\\n', 'easily overlooked it: and it was impossible that his majesty, a most\\n', 'judicious prince, should not provide himself with a good number of such\\n', 'wise and able counsellors.  Yet perhaps the virtue of those reverend\\n', 'sages was too strict for the corrupt and libertine manners of a court:\\n', 'and we often find by experience, that young men are too opinionated and\\n', 'volatile to be guided by the sober dictates of their seniors.  However,\\n', 'since the king was pleased to allow me access to his royal person, I was\\n', 'resolved, upon the very first occasion, to deliver my opinion to him on\\n', 'this matter freely and at large, by the help of my interpreter; and\\n', 'whether he would please to take my advice or not, yet in one thing I was\\n', 'determined, that his majesty having frequently offered me an\\n', 'establishment in this country, I would, with great thankfulness, accept\\n', 'the favour, and pass my life here in the conversation of those superior\\n', 'beings the _struldbrugs_, if they would please to admit me.”\\n', '\\n', 'The gentleman to whom I addressed my discourse, because (as I have\\n', 'already observed) he spoke the language of Balnibarbi, said to me, with a\\n', 'sort of a smile which usually arises from pity to the ignorant, “that he\\n', 'was glad of any occasion to keep me among them, and desired my permission\\n', 'to explain to the company what I had spoke.”  He did so, and they talked\\n', 'together for some time in their own language, whereof I understood not a\\n', 'syllable, neither could I observe by their countenances, what impression\\n', 'my discourse had made on them.  After a short silence, the same person\\n', 'told me, “that his friends and mine (so he thought fit to express\\n', 'himself) were very much pleased with the judicious remarks I had made on\\n', 'the great happiness and advantages of immortal life, and they were\\n', 'desirous to know, in a particular manner, what scheme of living I should\\n', 'have formed to myself, if it had fallen to my lot to have been born a\\n', '_struldbrug_.”\\n', '\\n', 'I answered, “it was easy to be eloquent on so copious and delightful a\\n', 'subject, especially to me, who had been often apt to amuse myself with\\n', 'visions of what I should do, if I were a king, a general, or a great\\n', 'lord: and upon this very case, I had frequently run over the whole system\\n', 'how I should employ myself, and pass the time, if I were sure to live for\\n', 'ever.\\n', '\\n', '“That, if it had been my good fortune to come into the world a\\n', '_struldbrug_, as soon as I could discover my own happiness, by\\n', 'understanding the difference between life and death, I would first\\n', 'resolve, by all arts and methods, whatsoever, to procure myself riches.\\n', 'In the pursuit of which, by thrift and management, I might reasonably\\n', 'expect, in about two hundred years, to be the wealthiest man in the\\n', 'kingdom.  In the second place, I would, from my earliest youth, apply\\n', 'myself to the study of arts and sciences, by which I should arrive in\\n', 'time to excel all others in learning.  Lastly, I would carefully record\\n', 'every action and event of consequence, that happened in the public,\\n', 'impartially draw the characters of the several successions of princes and\\n', 'great ministers of state, with my own observations on every point.  I\\n', 'would exactly set down the several changes in customs, language, fashions\\n', 'of dress, diet, and diversions.  By all which acquirements, I should be a\\n', 'living treasure of knowledge and wisdom, and certainly become the oracle\\n', 'of the nation.\\n', '\\n', '“I would never marry after threescore, but live in a hospitable manner,\\n', 'yet still on the saving side.  I would entertain myself in forming and\\n', 'directing the minds of hopeful young men, by convincing them, from my own\\n', 'remembrance, experience, and observation, fortified by numerous examples,\\n', 'of the usefulness of virtue in public and private life.  But my choice\\n', 'and constant companions should be a set of my own immortal brotherhood;\\n', 'among whom, I would elect a dozen from the most ancient, down to my own\\n', 'contemporaries.  Where any of these wanted fortunes, I would provide them\\n', 'with convenient lodges round my own estate, and have some of them always\\n', 'at my table; only mingling a few of the most valuable among you mortals,\\n', 'whom length of time would harden me to lose with little or no reluctance,\\n', 'and treat your posterity after the same manner; just as a man diverts\\n', 'himself with the annual succession of pinks and tulips in his garden,\\n', 'without regretting the loss of those which withered the preceding year.\\n', '\\n', '“These _struldbrugs_ and I would mutually communicate our observations\\n', 'and memorials, through the course of time; remark the several gradations\\n', 'by which corruption steals into the world, and oppose it in every step,\\n', 'by giving perpetual warning and instruction to mankind; which, added to\\n', 'the strong influence of our own example, would probably prevent that\\n', 'continual degeneracy of human nature so justly complained of in all ages.\\n', '\\n', '“Add to this, the pleasure of seeing the various revolutions of states\\n', 'and empires; the changes in the lower and upper world; ancient cities in\\n', 'ruins, and obscure villages become the seats of kings; famous rivers\\n', 'lessening into shallow brooks; the ocean leaving one coast dry, and\\n', 'overwhelming another; the discovery of many countries yet unknown;\\n', 'barbarity overrunning the politest nations, and the most barbarous become\\n', 'civilized.  I should then see the discovery of the longitude, the\\n', 'perpetual motion, the universal medicine, and many other great\\n', 'inventions, brought to the utmost perfection.\\n', '\\n', '“What wonderful discoveries should we make in astronomy, by outliving and\\n', 'confirming our own predictions; by observing the progress and return of\\n', 'comets, with the changes of motion in the sun, moon, and stars!”\\n', '\\n', 'I enlarged upon many other topics, which the natural desire of endless\\n', 'life, and sublunary happiness, could easily furnish me with.  When I had\\n', 'ended, and the sum of my discourse had been interpreted, as before, to\\n', 'the rest of the company, there was a good deal of talk among them in the\\n', 'language of the country, not without some laughter at my expense.  At\\n', 'last, the same gentleman who had been my interpreter, said, “he was\\n', 'desired by the rest to set me right in a few mistakes, which I had fallen\\n', 'into through the common imbecility of human nature, and upon that\\n', 'allowance was less answerable for them.  That this breed of _struldbrugs_\\n', 'was peculiar to their country, for there were no such people either in\\n', 'Balnibarbi or Japan, where he had the honour to be ambassador from his\\n', 'majesty, and found the natives in both those kingdoms very hard to\\n', 'believe that the fact was possible: and it appeared from my astonishment\\n', 'when he first mentioned the matter to me, that I received it as a thing\\n', 'wholly new, and scarcely to be credited.  That in the two kingdoms above\\n', 'mentioned, where, during his residence, he had conversed very much, he\\n', 'observed long life to be the universal desire and wish of mankind.  That\\n', 'whoever had one foot in the grave was sure to hold back the other as\\n', 'strongly as he could.  That the oldest had still hopes of living one day\\n', 'longer, and looked on death as the greatest evil, from which nature\\n', 'always prompted him to retreat.  Only in this island of Luggnagg the\\n', 'appetite for living was not so eager, from the continual example of the\\n', '_struldbrugs_ before their eyes.\\n', '\\n', '“That the system of living contrived by me, was unreasonable and unjust;\\n', 'because it supposed a perpetuity of youth, health, and vigour, which no\\n', 'man could be so foolish to hope, however extravagant he may be in his\\n', 'wishes.  That the question therefore was not, whether a man would choose\\n', 'to be always in the prime of youth, attended with prosperity and health;\\n', 'but how he would pass a perpetual life under all the usual disadvantages\\n', 'which old age brings along with it.  For although few men will avow their\\n', 'desires of being immortal, upon such hard conditions, yet in the two\\n', 'kingdoms before mentioned, of Balnibarbi and Japan, he observed that\\n', 'every man desired to put off death some time longer, let it approach ever\\n', 'so late: and he rarely heard of any man who died willingly, except he\\n', 'were incited by the extremity of grief or torture.  And he appealed to\\n', 'me, whether in those countries I had travelled, as well as my own, I had\\n', 'not observed the same general disposition.”\\n', '\\n', 'After this preface, he gave me a particular account of the _struldbrugs_\\n', 'among them.  He said, “they commonly acted like mortals till about thirty\\n', 'years old; after which, by degrees, they grew melancholy and dejected,\\n', 'increasing in both till they came to fourscore.  This he learned from\\n', 'their own confession: for otherwise, there not being above two or three\\n', 'of that species born in an age, they were too few to form a general\\n', 'observation by.  When they came to fourscore years, which is reckoned the\\n', 'extremity of living in this country, they had not only all the follies\\n', 'and infirmities of other old men, but many more which arose from the\\n', 'dreadful prospect of never dying.  They were not only opinionative,\\n', 'peevish, covetous, morose, vain, talkative, but incapable of friendship,\\n', 'and dead to all natural affection, which never descended below their\\n', 'grandchildren.  Envy and impotent desires are their prevailing passions.\\n', 'But those objects against which their envy seems principally directed,\\n', 'are the vices of the younger sort and the deaths of the old.  By\\n', 'reflecting on the former, they find themselves cut off from all\\n', 'possibility of pleasure; and whenever they see a funeral, they lament and\\n', 'repine that others have gone to a harbour of rest to which they\\n', 'themselves never can hope to arrive.  They have no remembrance of\\n', 'anything but what they learned and observed in their youth and\\n', 'middle-age, and even that is very imperfect; and for the truth or\\n', 'particulars of any fact, it is safer to depend on common tradition, than\\n', 'upon their best recollections.  The least miserable among them appear to\\n', 'be those who turn to dotage, and entirely lose their memories; these meet\\n', 'with more pity and assistance, because they want many bad qualities which\\n', 'abound in others.\\n', '\\n', '“If a _struldbrug_ happen to marry one of his own kind, the marriage is\\n', 'dissolved of course, by the courtesy of the kingdom, as soon as the\\n', 'younger of the two comes to be fourscore; for the law thinks it a\\n', 'reasonable indulgence, that those who are condemned, without any fault of\\n', 'their own, to a perpetual continuance in the world, should not have their\\n', 'misery doubled by the load of a wife.\\n', '\\n', '“As soon as they have completed the term of eighty years, they are looked\\n', 'on as dead in law; their heirs immediately succeed to their estates; only\\n', 'a small pittance is reserved for their support; and the poor ones are\\n', 'maintained at the public charge.  After that period, they are held\\n', 'incapable of any employment of trust or profit; they cannot purchase\\n', 'lands, or take leases; neither are they allowed to be witnesses in any\\n', 'cause, either civil or criminal, not even for the decision of meers and\\n', 'bounds.\\n', '\\n', '“At ninety, they lose their teeth and hair; they have at that age no\\n', 'distinction of taste, but eat and drink whatever they can get, without\\n', 'relish or appetite.  The diseases they were subject to still continue,\\n', 'without increasing or diminishing.  In talking, they forget the common\\n', 'appellation of things, and the names of persons, even of those who are\\n', 'their nearest friends and relations.  For the same reason, they never can\\n', 'amuse themselves with reading, because their memory will not serve to\\n', 'carry them from the beginning of a sentence to the end; and by this\\n', 'defect, they are deprived of the only entertainment whereof they might\\n', 'otherwise be capable.\\n', '\\n', '“The language of this country being always upon the flux, the\\n', '_struldbrugs_ of one age do not understand those of another; neither are\\n', 'they able, after two hundred years, to hold any conversation (farther\\n', 'than by a few general words) with their neighbours the mortals; and thus\\n', 'they lie under the disadvantage of living like foreigners in their own\\n', 'country.”\\n', '\\n', 'This was the account given me of the _struldbrugs_, as near as I can\\n', 'remember.  I afterwards saw five or six of different ages, the youngest\\n', 'not above two hundred years old, who were brought to me at several times\\n', 'by some of my friends; but although they were told, “that I was a great\\n', 'traveller, and had seen all the world,” they had not the least curiosity\\n', 'to ask me a question; only desired “I would give them _slumskudask_,” or\\n', 'a token of remembrance; which is a modest way of begging, to avoid the\\n', 'law, that strictly forbids it, because they are provided for by the\\n', 'public, although indeed with a very scanty allowance.\\n', '\\n', 'They are despised and hated by all sorts of people.  When one of them is\\n', 'born, it is reckoned ominous, and their birth is recorded very\\n', 'particularly so that you may know their age by consulting the register,\\n', 'which, however, has not been kept above a thousand years past, or at\\n', 'least has been destroyed by time or public disturbances.  But the usual\\n', 'way of computing how old they are, is by asking them what kings or great\\n', 'persons they can remember, and then consulting history; for infallibly\\n', 'the last prince in their mind did not begin his reign after they were\\n', 'fourscore years old.\\n', '\\n', 'They were the most mortifying sight I ever beheld; and the women more\\n', 'horrible than the men.  Besides the usual deformities in extreme old age,\\n', 'they acquired an additional ghastliness, in proportion to their number of\\n', 'years, which is not to be described; and among half a dozen, I soon\\n', 'distinguished which was the eldest, although there was not above a\\n', 'century or two between them.\\n', '\\n', 'The reader will easily believe, that from what I had hear and seen, my\\n', 'keen appetite for perpetuity of life was much abated.  I grew heartily\\n', 'ashamed of the pleasing visions I had formed; and thought no tyrant could\\n', 'invent a death into which I would not run with pleasure, from such a\\n', 'life.  The king heard of all that had passed between me and my friends\\n', 'upon this occasion, and rallied me very pleasantly; wishing I could send\\n', 'a couple of _struldbrugs_ to my own country, to arm our people against\\n', 'the fear of death; but this, it seems, is forbidden by the fundamental\\n', 'laws of the kingdom, or else I should have been well content with the\\n', 'trouble and expense of transporting them.\\n', '\\n', 'I could not but agree, that the laws of this kingdom relative to the\\n', '_struldbrugs_ were founded upon the strongest reasons, and such as any\\n', 'other country would be under the necessity of enacting, in the like\\n', 'circumstances.  Otherwise, as avarice is the necessary consequence of old\\n', 'age, those immortals would in time become proprietors of the whole\\n', 'nation, and engross the civil power, which, for want of abilities to\\n', 'manage, must end in the ruin of the public.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER XI.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The author leaves Luggnagg, and sails to Japan.  From thence he returns\\n', 'in a Dutch ship to Amsterdam, and from Amsterdam to England.\\n', '\\n', 'I thought this account of the _struldbrugs_ might be some entertainment\\n', 'to the reader, because it seems to be a little out of the common way; at\\n', 'least I do not remember to have met the like in any book of travels that\\n', 'has come to my hands: and if I am deceived, my excuse must be, that it is\\n', 'necessary for travellers who describe the same country, very often to\\n', 'agree in dwelling on the same particulars, without deserving the censure\\n', 'of having borrowed or transcribed from those who wrote before them.\\n', '\\n', 'There is indeed a perpetual commerce between this kingdom and the great\\n', 'empire of Japan; and it is very probable, that the Japanese authors may\\n', 'have given some account of the _struldbrugs_; but my stay in Japan was so\\n', 'short, and I was so entirely a stranger to the language, that I was not\\n', 'qualified to make any inquiries.  But I hope the Dutch, upon this notice,\\n', 'will be curious and able enough to supply my defects.\\n', '\\n', 'His majesty having often pressed me to accept some employment in his\\n', 'court, and finding me absolutely determined to return to my native\\n', 'country, was pleased to give me his license to depart; and honoured me\\n', 'with a letter of recommendation, under his own hand, to the Emperor of\\n', 'Japan.  He likewise presented me with four hundred and forty-four large\\n', 'pieces of gold (this nation delighting in even numbers), and a red\\n', 'diamond, which I sold in England for eleven hundred pounds.\\n', '\\n', 'On the 6th of May, 1709, I took a solemn leave of his majesty, and all my\\n', 'friends.  This prince was so gracious as to order a guard to conduct me\\n', 'to Glanguenstald, which is a royal port to the south-west part of the\\n', 'island.  In six days I found a vessel ready to carry me to Japan, and\\n', 'spent fifteen days in the voyage.  We landed at a small port-town called\\n', 'Xamoschi, situated on the south-east part of Japan; the town lies on the\\n', 'western point, where there is a narrow strait leading northward into\\n', 'along arm of the sea, upon the north-west part of which, Yedo, the\\n', 'metropolis, stands.  At landing, I showed the custom-house officers my\\n', 'letter from the king of Luggnagg to his imperial majesty.  They knew the\\n', 'seal perfectly well; it was as broad as the palm of my hand.  The\\n', 'impression was, _A king lifting up a lame beggar from the earth_.  The\\n', 'magistrates of the town, hearing of my letter, received me as a public\\n', 'minister.  They provided me with carriages and servants, and bore my\\n', 'charges to Yedo; where I was admitted to an audience, and delivered my\\n', 'letter, which was opened with great ceremony, and explained to the\\n', 'Emperor by an interpreter, who then gave me notice, by his majesty’s\\n', 'order, “that I should signify my request, and, whatever it were, it\\n', 'should be granted, for the sake of his royal brother of Luggnagg.”  This\\n', 'interpreter was a person employed to transact affairs with the\\n', 'Hollanders.  He soon conjectured, by my countenance, that I was a\\n', 'European, and therefore repeated his majesty’s commands in Low Dutch,\\n', 'which he spoke perfectly well.  I answered, as I had before determined,\\n', '“that I was a Dutch merchant, shipwrecked in a very remote country,\\n', 'whence I had travelled by sea and land to Luggnagg, and then took\\n', 'shipping for Japan; where I knew my countrymen often traded, and with\\n', 'some of these I hoped to get an opportunity of returning into Europe: I\\n', 'therefore most humbly entreated his royal favour, to give order that I\\n', 'should be conducted in safety to Nangasac.”  To this I added another\\n', 'petition, “that for the sake of my patron the king of Luggnagg, his\\n', 'majesty would condescend to excuse my performing the ceremony imposed on\\n', 'my countrymen, of trampling upon the crucifix: because I had been thrown\\n', 'into his kingdom by my misfortunes, without any intention of trading.”\\n', 'When this latter petition was interpreted to the Emperor, he seemed a\\n', 'little surprised; and said, “he believed I was the first of my countrymen\\n', 'who ever made any scruple in this point; and that he began to doubt,\\n', 'whether I was a real Hollander, or not; but rather suspected I must be a\\n', 'Christian.  However, for the reasons I had offered, but chiefly to\\n', 'gratify the king of Luggnagg by an uncommon mark of his favour, he would\\n', 'comply with the singularity of my humour; but the affair must be managed\\n', 'with dexterity, and his officers should be commanded to let me pass, as\\n', 'it were by forgetfulness.  For he assured me, that if the secret should\\n', 'be discovered by my countrymen the Dutch, they would cut my throat in the\\n', 'voyage.”  I returned my thanks, by the interpreter, for so unusual a\\n', 'favour; and some troops being at that time on their march to Nangasac,\\n', 'the commanding officer had orders to convey me safe thither, with\\n', 'particular instructions about the business of the crucifix.\\n', '\\n', 'On the 9th day of June, 1709, I arrived at Nangasac, after a very long\\n', 'and troublesome journey.  I soon fell into the company of some Dutch\\n', 'sailors belonging to the Amboyna, of Amsterdam, a stout ship of 450 tons.\\n', 'I had lived long in Holland, pursuing my studies at Leyden, and I spoke\\n', 'Dutch well.  The seamen soon knew whence I came last: they were curious\\n', 'to inquire into my voyages and course of life.  I made up a story as\\n', 'short and probable as I could, but concealed the greatest part.  I knew\\n', 'many persons in Holland.  I was able to invent names for my parents, whom\\n', 'I pretended to be obscure people in the province of Gelderland.  I would\\n', 'have given the captain (one Theodorus Vangrult) what he pleased to ask\\n', 'for my voyage to Holland; but understanding I was a surgeon, he was\\n', 'contented to take half the usual rate, on condition that I would serve\\n', 'him in the way of my calling.  Before we took shipping, I was often asked\\n', 'by some of the crew, whether I had performed the ceremony above\\n', 'mentioned?  I evaded the question by general answers; “that I had\\n', 'satisfied the Emperor and court in all particulars.”  However, a\\n', 'malicious rogue of a skipper went to an officer, and pointing to me, told\\n', 'him, “I had not yet trampled on the crucifix;” but the other, who had\\n', 'received instructions to let me pass, gave the rascal twenty strokes on\\n', 'the shoulders with a bamboo; after which I was no more troubled with such\\n', 'questions.\\n', '\\n', 'Nothing happened worth mentioning in this voyage.  We sailed with a fair\\n', 'wind to the Cape of Good Hope, where we staid only to take in fresh\\n', 'water.  On the 10th of April, 1710, we arrived safe at Amsterdam, having\\n', 'lost only three men by sickness in the voyage, and a fourth, who fell\\n', 'from the foremast into the sea, not far from the coast of Guinea.  From\\n', 'Amsterdam I soon after set sail for England, in a small vessel belonging\\n', 'to that city.\\n', '\\n', 'On the 16th of April we put in at the Downs.  I landed next morning, and\\n', 'saw once more my native country, after an absence of five years and six\\n', 'months complete.  I went straight to Redriff, where I arrived the same\\n', 'day at two in the afternoon, and found my wife and family in good health.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'PART IV.

The author meets two Houyhnhnms.\\n', '\\n', 'I continued at home with my wife and children about five months, in a\\n', 'very happy condition, if I could have learned the lesson of knowing when\\n', 'I was well.  I left my poor wife big with child, and accepted an\\n', 'advantageous offer made me to be captain of the Adventurer, a stout\\n', 'merchantman of 350 tons: for I understood navigation well, and being\\n', 'grown weary of a surgeon’s employment at sea, which, however, I could\\n', 'exercise upon occasion, I took a skilful young man of that calling, one\\n', 'Robert Purefoy, into my ship.  We set sail from Portsmouth upon the 7th\\n', 'day of September, 1710; on the 14th we met with Captain Pocock, of\\n', 'Bristol, at Teneriffe, who was going to the bay of Campechy to cut\\n', 'logwood.  On the 16th, he was parted from us by a storm; I heard since my\\n', 'return, that his ship foundered, and none escaped but one cabin boy.  He\\n', 'was an honest man, and a good sailor, but a little too positive in his\\n', 'own opinions, which was the cause of his destruction, as it has been with\\n', 'several others; for if he had followed my advice, he might have been safe\\n', 'at home with his family at this time, as well as myself.\\n', '\\n', 'I had several men who died in my ship of calentures, so that I was forced\\n', 'to get recruits out of Barbadoes and the Leeward Islands, where I\\n', 'touched, by the direction of the merchants who employed me; which I had\\n', 'soon too much cause to repent: for I found afterwards, that most of them\\n', 'had been buccaneers.  I had fifty hands onboard; and my orders were, that\\n', 'I should trade with the Indians in the South-Sea, and make what\\n', 'discoveries I could.  These rogues, whom I had picked up, debauched my\\n', 'other men, and they all formed a conspiracy to seize the ship, and secure\\n', 'me; which they did one morning, rushing into my cabin, and binding me\\n', 'hand and foot, threatening to throw me overboard, if I offered to stir.\\n', 'I told them, “I was their prisoner, and would submit.”  This they made me\\n', 'swear to do, and then they unbound me, only fastening one of my legs with\\n', 'a chain, near my bed, and placed a sentry at my door with his piece\\n', 'charged, who was commanded to shoot me dead if I attempted my liberty.\\n', 'They sent me own victuals and drink, and took the government of the ship\\n', 'to themselves.  Their design was to turn pirates and, plunder the\\n', 'Spaniards, which they could not do till they got more men.  But first\\n', 'they resolved to sell the goods the ship, and then go to Madagascar for\\n', 'recruits, several among them having died since my confinement.  They\\n', 'sailed many weeks, and traded with the Indians; but I knew not what\\n', 'course they took, being kept a close prisoner in my cabin, and expecting\\n', 'nothing less than to be murdered, as they often threatened me.\\n', '\\n', 'Upon the 9th day of May, 1711, one James Welch came down to my cabin, and\\n', 'said, “he had orders from the captain to set me ashore.”  I expostulated\\n', 'with him, but in vain; neither would he so much as tell me who their new\\n', 'captain was.  They forced me into the long-boat, letting me put on my\\n', 'best suit of clothes, which were as good as new, and take a small bundle\\n', 'of linen, but no arms, except my hanger; and they were so civil as not to\\n', 'search my pockets, into which I conveyed what money I had, with some\\n', 'other little necessaries.  They rowed about a league, and then set me\\n', 'down on a strand.  I desired them to tell me what country it was.  They\\n', 'all swore, “they knew no more than myself;” but said, “that the captain”\\n', '(as they called him) “was resolved, after they had sold the lading, to\\n', 'get rid of me in the first place where they could discover land.”  They\\n', 'pushed off immediately, advising me to make haste for fear of being\\n', 'overtaken by the tide, and so bade me farewell.\\n', '\\n', 'In this desolate condition I advanced forward, and soon got upon firm\\n', 'ground, where I sat down on a bank to rest myself, and consider what I\\n', 'had best do.  When I was a little refreshed, I went up into the country,\\n', 'resolving to deliver myself to the first savages I should meet, and\\n', 'purchase my life from them by some bracelets, glass rings, and other\\n', 'toys, which sailors usually provide themselves with in those voyages, and\\n', 'whereof I had some about me.  The land was divided by long rows of trees,\\n', 'not regularly planted, but naturally growing; there was great plenty of\\n', 'grass, and several fields of oats.  I walked very circumspectly, for fear\\n', 'of being surprised, or suddenly shot with an arrow from behind, or on\\n', 'either side.  I fell into a beaten road, where I saw many tracts of human\\n', 'feet, and some of cows, but most of horses.  At last I beheld several\\n', 'animals in a field, and one or two of the same kind sitting in trees.\\n', 'Their shape was very singular and deformed, which a little discomposed\\n', 'me, so that I lay down behind a thicket to observe them better.  Some of\\n', 'them coming forward near the place where I lay, gave me an opportunity of\\n', 'distinctly marking their form.  Their heads and breasts were covered with\\n', 'a thick hair, some frizzled, and others lank; they had beards like goats,\\n', 'and a long ridge of hair down their backs, and the fore parts of their\\n', 'legs and feet; but the rest of their bodies was bare, so that I might see\\n', 'their skins, which were of a brown buff colour.  They had no tails, nor\\n', 'any hair at all on their buttocks, except about the anus, which, I\\n', 'presume, nature had placed there to defend them as they sat on the\\n', 'ground, for this posture they used, as well as lying down, and often\\n', 'stood on their hind feet.  They climbed high trees as nimbly as a\\n', 'squirrel, for they had strong extended claws before and behind,\\n', 'terminating in sharp points, and hooked.  They would often spring, and\\n', 'bound, and leap, with prodigious agility.  The females were not so large\\n', 'as the males; they had long lank hair on their heads, but none on their\\n', 'faces, nor any thing more than a sort of down on the rest of their\\n', 'bodies, except about the anus and pudenda.  The dugs hung between their\\n', 'fore feet, and often reached almost to the ground as they walked.  The\\n', 'hair of both sexes was of several colours, brown, red, black, and yellow.\\n', 'Upon the whole, I never beheld, in all my travels, so disagreeable an\\n', 'animal, or one against which I naturally conceived so strong an\\n', 'antipathy.  So that, thinking I had seen enough, full of contempt and\\n', 'aversion, I got up, and pursued the beaten road, hoping it might direct\\n', 'me to the cabin of some Indian.  I had not got far, when I met one of\\n', 'these creatures full in my way, and coming up directly to me.  The ugly\\n', 'monster, when he saw me, distorted several ways, every feature of his\\n', 'visage, and stared, as at an object he had never seen before; then\\n', 'approaching nearer, lifted up his fore-paw, whether out of curiosity or\\n', 'mischief I could not tell; but I drew my hanger, and gave him a good blow\\n', 'with the flat side of it, for I durst not strike with the edge, fearing\\n', 'the inhabitants might be provoked against me, if they should come to know\\n', 'that I had killed or maimed any of their cattle.  When the beast felt the\\n', 'smart, he drew back, and roared so loud, that a herd of at least forty\\n', 'came flocking about me from the next field, howling and making odious\\n', 'faces; but I ran to the body of a tree, and leaning my back against it,\\n', 'kept them off by waving my hanger.  Several of this cursed brood, getting\\n', 'hold of the branches behind, leaped up into the tree, whence they began\\n', 'to discharge their excrements on my head; however, I escaped pretty well\\n', 'by sticking close to the stem of the tree, but was almost stifled with\\n', 'the filth, which fell about me on every side.\\n', '\\n', 'In the midst of this distress, I observed them all to run away on a\\n', 'sudden as fast as they could; at which I ventured to leave the tree and\\n', 'pursue the road, wondering what it was that could put them into this\\n', 'fright.  But looking on my left hand, I saw a horse walking softly in the\\n', 'field; which my persecutors having sooner discovered, was the cause of\\n', 'their flight.  The horse started a little, when he came near me, but soon\\n', 'recovering himself, looked full in my face with manifest tokens of\\n', 'wonder; he viewed my hands and feet, walking round me several times.  I\\n', 'would have pursued my journey, but he placed himself directly in the way,\\n', 'yet looking with a very mild aspect, never offering the least violence.\\n', 'We stood gazing at each other for some time; at last I took the boldness\\n', 'to reach my hand towards his neck with a design to stroke it, using the\\n', 'common style and whistle of jockeys, when they are going to handle a\\n', 'strange horse.  But this animal seemed to receive my civilities with\\n', 'disdain, shook his head, and bent his brows, softly raising up his right\\n', 'fore-foot to remove my hand.  Then he neighed three or four times, but in\\n', 'so different a cadence, that I almost began to think he was speaking to\\n', 'himself, in some language of his own.\\n', '\\n', 'While he and I were thus employed, another horse came up; who applying\\n', 'himself to the first in a very formal manner, they gently struck each\\n', 'other’s right hoof before, neighing several times by turns, and varying\\n', 'the sound, which seemed to be almost articulate.  They went some paces\\n', 'off, as if it were to confer together, walking side by side, backward and\\n', 'forward, like persons deliberating upon some affair of weight, but often\\n', 'turning their eyes towards me, as it were to watch that I might not\\n', 'escape.  I was amazed to see such actions and behaviour in brute beasts;\\n', 'and concluded with myself, that if the inhabitants of this country were\\n', 'endued with a proportionable degree of reason, they must needs be the\\n', 'wisest people upon earth.  This thought gave me so much comfort, that I\\n', 'resolved to go forward, until I could discover some house or village, or\\n', 'meet with any of the natives, leaving the two horses to discourse\\n', 'together as they pleased.  But the first, who was a dapple gray,\\n', 'observing me to steal off, neighed after me in so expressive a tone, that\\n', 'I fancied myself to understand what he meant; whereupon I turned back,\\n', 'and came near to him to expect his farther commands: but concealing my\\n', 'fear as much as I could, for I began to be in some pain how this\\n', 'adventure might terminate; and the reader will easily believe I did not\\n', 'much like my present situation.\\n', '\\n', 'The two horses came up close to me, looking with great earnestness upon\\n', 'my face and hands.  The gray steed rubbed my hat all round with his right\\n', 'fore-hoof, and discomposed it so much that I was forced to adjust it\\n', 'better by taking it off and settling it again; whereat, both he and his\\n', 'companion (who was a brown bay) appeared to be much surprised: the latter\\n', 'felt the lappet of my coat, and finding it to hang loose about me, they\\n', 'both looked with new signs of wonder.  He stroked my right hand, seeming\\n', 'to admire the softness and colour; but he squeezed it so hard between his\\n', 'hoof and his pastern, that I was forced to roar; after which they both\\n', 'touched me with all possible tenderness.  They were under great\\n', 'perplexity about my shoes and stockings, which they felt very often,\\n', 'neighing to each other, and using various gestures, not unlike those of a\\n', 'philosopher, when he would attempt to solve some new and difficult\\n', 'phenomenon.\\n', '\\n', 'Upon the whole, the behaviour of these animals was so orderly and\\n', 'rational, so acute and judicious, that I at last concluded they must\\n', 'needs be magicians, who had thus metamorphosed themselves upon some\\n', 'design, and seeing a stranger in the way, resolved to divert themselves\\n', 'with him; or, perhaps, were really amazed at the sight of a man so very\\n', 'different in habit, feature, and complexion, from those who might\\n', 'probably live in so remote a climate.  Upon the strength of this\\n', 'reasoning, I ventured to address them in the following manner:\\n', '“Gentlemen, if you be conjurers, as I have good cause to believe, you can\\n', 'understand my language; therefore I make bold to let your worships know\\n', 'that I am a poor distressed Englishman, driven by his misfortunes upon\\n', 'your coast; and I entreat one of you to let me ride upon his back, as if\\n', 'he were a real horse, to some house or village where I can be relieved.\\n', 'In return of which favour, I will make you a present of this knife and\\n', 'bracelet,” taking them out of my pocket.  The two creatures stood silent\\n', 'while I spoke, seeming to listen with great attention, and when I had\\n', 'ended, they neighed frequently towards each other, as if they were\\n', 'engaged in serious conversation.  I plainly observed that their language\\n', 'expressed the passions very well, and the words might, with little pains,\\n', 'be resolved into an alphabet more easily than the Chinese.\\n', '\\n', 'I could frequently distinguish the word _Yahoo_, which was repeated by\\n', 'each of them several times: and although it was impossible for me to\\n', 'conjecture what it meant, yet while the two horses were busy in\\n', 'conversation, I endeavoured to practise this word upon my tongue; and as\\n', 'soon as they were silent, I boldly pronounced _Yahoo_ in a loud voice,\\n', 'imitating at the same time, as near as I could, the neighing of a horse;\\n', 'at which they were both visibly surprised; and the gray repeated the same\\n', 'word twice, as if he meant to teach me the right accent; wherein I spoke\\n', 'after him as well as I could, and found myself perceivably to improve\\n', 'every time, though very far from any degree of perfection.  Then the bay\\n', 'tried me with a second word, much harder to be pronounced; but reducing\\n', 'it to the English orthography, may be spelt thus, _Houyhnhnm_.  I did not\\n', 'succeed in this so well as in the former; but after two or three farther\\n', 'trials, I had better fortune; and they both appeared amazed at my\\n', 'capacity.\\n', '\\n', 'After some further discourse, which I then conjectured might relate to\\n', 'me, the two friends took their leaves, with the same compliment of\\n', 'striking each other’s hoof; and the gray made me signs that I should walk\\n', 'before him; wherein I thought it prudent to comply, till I could find a\\n', 'better director.  When I offered to slacken my pace, he would cry _hhuun\\n', 'hhuun_: I guessed his meaning, and gave him to understand, as well as I\\n', 'could, “that I was weary, and not able to walk faster;” upon which he\\n', 'would stand awhile to let me rest.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER II.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The author conducted by a Houyhnhnm to his house.  The house described.\\n', 'The author’s reception.  The food of the Houyhnhnms.  The author in\\n', 'distress for want of meat.  Is at last relieved.  His manner of feeding\\n', 'in this country.\\n', '\\n', 'Having travelled about three miles, we came to a long kind of building,\\n', 'made of timber stuck in the ground, and wattled across; the roof was low\\n', 'and covered with straw.  I now began to be a little comforted; and took\\n', 'out some toys, which travellers usually carry for presents to the savage\\n', 'Indians of America, and other parts, in hopes the people of the house\\n', 'would be thereby encouraged to receive me kindly.  The horse made me a\\n', 'sign to go in first; it was a large room with a smooth clay floor, and a\\n', 'rack and manger, extending the whole length on one side.  There were\\n', 'three nags and two mares, not eating, but some of them sitting down upon\\n', 'their hams, which I very much wondered at; but wondered more to see the\\n', 'rest employed in domestic business; these seemed but ordinary cattle.\\n', 'However, this confirmed my first opinion, that a people who could so far\\n', 'civilise brute animals, must needs excel in wisdom all the nations of the\\n', 'world.  The gray came in just after, and thereby prevented any ill\\n', 'treatment which the others might have given me.  He neighed to them\\n', 'several times in a style of authority, and received answers.\\n', '\\n', 'Beyond this room there were three others, reaching the length of the\\n', 'house, to which you passed through three doors, opposite to each other,\\n', 'in the manner of a vista.  We went through the second room towards the\\n', 'third.  Here the gray walked in first, beckoning me to attend: I waited\\n', 'in the second room, and got ready my presents for the master and mistress\\n', 'of the house; they were two knives, three bracelets of false pearls, a\\n', 'small looking-glass, and a bead necklace.  The horse neighed three or\\n', 'four times, and I waited to hear some answers in a human voice, but I\\n', 'heard no other returns than in the same dialect, only one or two a little\\n', 'shriller than his.  I began to think that this house must belong to some\\n', 'person of great note among them, because there appeared so much ceremony\\n', 'before I could gain admittance.  But, that a man of quality should be\\n', 'served all by horses, was beyond my comprehension.  I feared my brain was\\n', 'disturbed by my sufferings and misfortunes.  I roused myself, and looked\\n', 'about me in the room where I was left alone: this was furnished like the\\n', 'first, only after a more elegant manner.  I rubbed my eyes often, but the\\n', 'same objects still occurred.  I pinched my arms and sides to awake\\n', 'myself, hoping I might be in a dream.  I then absolutely concluded, that\\n', 'all these appearances could be nothing else but necromancy and magic.\\n', 'But I had no time to pursue these reflections; for the gray horse came to\\n', 'the door, and made me a sign to follow him into the third room where I\\n', 'saw a very comely mare, together with a colt and foal, sitting on their\\n', 'haunches upon mats of straw, not unartfully made, and perfectly neat and\\n', 'clean.\\n', '\\n', 'The mare soon after my entrance rose from her mat, and coming up close,\\n', 'after having nicely observed my hands and face, gave me a most\\n', 'contemptuous look; and turning to the horse, I heard the word _Yahoo_\\n', 'often repeated betwixt them; the meaning of which word I could not then\\n', 'comprehend, although it was the first I had learned to pronounce.  But I\\n', 'was soon better informed, to my everlasting mortification; for the horse,\\n', 'beckoning to me with his head, and repeating the _hhuun_, _hhuun_, as he\\n', 'did upon the road, which I understood was to attend him, led me out into\\n', 'a kind of court, where was another building, at some distance from the\\n', 'house.  Here we entered, and I saw three of those detestable creatures,\\n', 'which I first met after my landing, feeding upon roots, and the flesh of\\n', 'some animals, which I afterwards found to be that of asses and dogs, and\\n', 'now and then a cow, dead by accident or disease.  They were all tied by\\n', 'the neck with strong withes fastened to a beam; they held their food\\n', 'between the claws of their fore feet, and tore it with their teeth.\\n', '\\n', 'The master horse ordered a sorrel nag, one of his servants, to untie the\\n', 'largest of these animals, and take him into the yard.  The beast and I\\n', 'were brought close together, and by our countenances diligently compared\\n', 'both by master and servant, who thereupon repeated several times the word\\n', '_Yahoo_.  My horror and astonishment are not to be described, when I\\n', 'observed in this abominable animal, a perfect human figure: the face of\\n', 'it indeed was flat and broad, the nose depressed, the lips large, and the\\n', 'mouth wide; but these differences are common to all savage nations, where\\n', 'the lineaments of the countenance are distorted, by the natives suffering\\n', 'their infants to lie grovelling on the earth, or by carrying them on\\n', 'their backs, nuzzling with their face against the mothers’ shoulders.\\n', 'The fore-feet of the _Yahoo_ differed from my hands in nothing else but\\n', 'the length of the nails, the coarseness and brownness of the palms, and\\n', 'the hairiness on the backs.  There was the same resemblance between our\\n', 'feet, with the same differences; which I knew very well, though the\\n', 'horses did not, because of my shoes and stockings; the same in every part\\n', 'of our bodies except as to hairiness and colour, which I have already\\n', 'described.\\n', '\\n', 'The great difficulty that seemed to stick with the two horses, was to see\\n', 'the rest of my body so very different from that of a _Yahoo_, for which I\\n', 'was obliged to my clothes, whereof they had no conception.  The sorrel\\n', 'nag offered me a root, which he held (after their manner, as we shall\\n', 'describe in its proper place) between his hoof and pastern; I took it in\\n', 'my hand, and, having smelt it, returned it to him again as civilly as I\\n', 'could.  He brought out of the _Yahoos_’ kennel a piece of ass’s flesh;\\n', 'but it smelt so offensively that I turned from it with loathing: he then\\n', 'threw it to the _Yahoo_, by whom it was greedily devoured.  He afterwards\\n', 'showed me a wisp of hay, and a fetlock full of oats; but I shook my head,\\n', 'to signify that neither of these were food for me.  And indeed I now\\n', 'apprehended that I must absolutely starve, if I did not get to some of my\\n', 'own species; for as to those filthy _Yahoos_, although there were few\\n', 'greater lovers of mankind at that time than myself, yet I confess I never\\n', 'saw any sensitive being so detestable on all accounts; and the more I\\n', 'came near them the more hateful they grew, while I stayed in that\\n', 'country.  This the master horse observed by my behaviour, and therefore\\n', 'sent the _Yahoo_ back to his kennel.  He then put his fore-hoof to his\\n', 'mouth, at which I was much surprised, although he did it with ease, and\\n', 'with a motion that appeared perfectly natural, and made other signs, to\\n', 'know what I would eat; but I could not return him such an answer as he\\n', 'was able to apprehend; and if he had understood me, I did not see how it\\n', 'was possible to contrive any way for finding myself nourishment.  While\\n', 'we were thus engaged, I observed a cow passing by, whereupon I pointed to\\n', 'her, and expressed a desire to go and milk her.  This had its effect; for\\n', 'he led me back into the house, and ordered a mare-servant to open a room,\\n', 'where a good store of milk lay in earthen and wooden vessels, after a\\n', 'very orderly and cleanly manner.  She gave me a large bowlful, of which I\\n', 'drank very heartily, and found myself well refreshed.\\n', '\\n', 'About noon, I saw coming towards the house a kind of vehicle drawn like a\\n', 'sledge by four _Yahoos_.  There was in it an old steed, who seemed to be\\n', 'of quality; he alighted with his hind-feet forward, having by accident\\n', 'got a hurt in his left fore-foot.  He came to dine with our horse, who\\n', 'received him with great civility.  They dined in the best room, and had\\n', 'oats boiled in milk for the second course, which the old horse ate warm,\\n', 'but the rest cold.  Their mangers were placed circular in the middle of\\n', 'the room, and divided into several partitions, round which they sat on\\n', 'their haunches, upon bosses of straw.  In the middle was a large rack,\\n', 'with angles answering to every partition of the manger; so that each\\n', 'horse and mare ate their own hay, and their own mash of oats and milk,\\n', 'with much decency and regularity.  The behaviour of the young colt and\\n', 'foal appeared very modest, and that of the master and mistress extremely\\n', 'cheerful and complaisant to their guest.  The gray ordered me to stand by\\n', 'him; and much discourse passed between him and his friend concerning me,\\n', 'as I found by the stranger’s often looking on me, and the frequent\\n', 'repetition of the word _Yahoo_.\\n', '\\n', 'I happened to wear my gloves, which the master gray observing, seemed\\n', 'perplexed, discovering signs of wonder what I had done to my fore-feet.\\n', 'He put his hoof three or four times to them, as if he would signify, that\\n', 'I should reduce them to their former shape, which I presently did,\\n', 'pulling off both my gloves, and putting them into my pocket.  This\\n', 'occasioned farther talk; and I saw the company was pleased with my\\n', 'behaviour, whereof I soon found the good effects.  I was ordered to speak\\n', 'the few words I understood; and while they were at dinner, the master\\n', 'taught me the names for oats, milk, fire, water, and some others, which I\\n', 'could readily pronounce after him, having from my youth a great facility\\n', 'in learning languages.\\n', '\\n', 'When dinner was done, the master horse took me aside, and by signs and\\n', 'words made me understand the concern he was in that I had nothing to eat.\\n', 'Oats in their tongue are called _hlunnh_.  This word I pronounced two or\\n', 'three times; for although I had refused them at first, yet, upon second\\n', 'thoughts, I considered that I could contrive to make of them a kind of\\n', 'bread, which might be sufficient, with milk, to keep me alive, till I\\n', 'could make my escape to some other country, and to creatures of my own\\n', 'species.  The horse immediately ordered a white mare servant of his\\n', 'family to bring me a good quantity of oats in a sort of wooden tray.\\n', 'These I heated before the fire, as well as I could, and rubbed them till\\n', 'the husks came off, which I made a shift to winnow from the grain.  I\\n', 'ground and beat them between two stones; then took water, and made them\\n', 'into a paste or cake, which I toasted at the fire and eat warm with milk.\\n', 'It was at first a very insipid diet, though common enough in many parts\\n', 'of Europe, but grew tolerable by time; and having been often reduced to\\n', 'hard fare in my life, this was not the first experiment I had made how\\n', 'easily nature is satisfied.  And I cannot but observe, that I never had\\n', 'one hours sickness while I stayed in this island.  It is true, I\\n', 'sometimes made a shift to catch a rabbit, or bird, by springs made of\\n', '_Yahoo’s_ hairs; and I often gathered wholesome herbs, which I boiled,\\n', 'and ate as salads with my bread; and now and then, for a rarity, I made a\\n', 'little butter, and drank the whey.  I was at first at a great loss for\\n', 'salt, but custom soon reconciled me to the want of it; and I am confident\\n', 'that the frequent use of salt among us is an effect of luxury, and was\\n', 'first introduced only as a provocative to drink, except where it is\\n', 'necessary for preserving flesh in long voyages, or in places remote from\\n', 'great markets; for we observe no animal to be fond of it but man, and as\\n', 'to myself, when I left this country, it was a great while before I could\\n', 'endure the taste of it in anything that I ate.\\n', '\\n', 'This is enough to say upon the subject of my diet, wherewith other\\n', 'travellers fill their books, as if the readers were personally concerned\\n', 'whether we fare well or ill.  However, it was necessary to mention this\\n', 'matter, lest the world should think it impossible that I could find\\n', 'sustenance for three years in such a country, and among such inhabitants.\\n', '\\n', 'When it grew towards evening, the master horse ordered a place for me to\\n', 'lodge in; it was but six yards from the house and separated from the\\n', 'stable of the _Yahoos_.  Here I got some straw, and covering myself with\\n', 'my own clothes, slept very sound.  But I was in a short time better\\n', 'accommodated, as the reader shall know hereafter, when I come to treat\\n', 'more particularly about my way of living.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER III.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The author studies to learn the language.  The Houyhnhnm, his master,\\n', 'assists in teaching him.  The language described.  Several Houyhnhnms of\\n', 'quality come out of curiosity to see the author.  He gives his master a\\n', 'short account of his voyage.\\n', '\\n', 'My principal endeavour was to learn the language, which my master (for so\\n', 'I shall henceforth call him), and his children, and every servant of his\\n', 'house, were desirous to teach me; for they looked upon it as a prodigy,\\n', 'that a brute animal should discover such marks of a rational creature.  I\\n', 'pointed to every thing, and inquired the name of it, which I wrote down\\n', 'in my journal-book when I was alone, and corrected my bad accent by\\n', 'desiring those of the family to pronounce it often.  In this employment,\\n', 'a sorrel nag, one of the under-servants, was very ready to assist me.\\n', '\\n', 'In speaking, they pronounced through the nose and throat, and their\\n', 'language approaches nearest to the High-Dutch, or German, of any I know\\n', 'in Europe; but is much more graceful and significant.  The emperor\\n', 'Charles V. made almost the same observation, when he said “that if he\\n', 'were to speak to his horse, it should be in High-Dutch.”\\n', '\\n', 'The curiosity and impatience of my master were so great, that he spent\\n', 'many hours of his leisure to instruct me.  He was convinced (as he\\n', 'afterwards told me) that I must be a _Yahoo_; but my teachableness,\\n', 'civility, and cleanliness, astonished him; which were qualities\\n', 'altogether opposite to those animals.  He was most perplexed about my\\n', 'clothes, reasoning sometimes with himself, whether they were a part of my\\n', 'body: for I never pulled them off till the family were asleep, and got\\n', 'them on before they waked in the morning.  My master was eager to learn\\n', '“whence I came; how I acquired those appearances of reason, which I\\n', 'discovered in all my actions; and to know my story from my own mouth,\\n', 'which he hoped he should soon do by the great proficiency I made in\\n', 'learning and pronouncing their words and sentences.”  To help my memory,\\n', 'I formed all I learned into the English alphabet, and writ the words\\n', 'down, with the translations.  This last, after some time, I ventured to\\n', 'do in my master’s presence.  It cost me much trouble to explain to him\\n', 'what I was doing; for the inhabitants have not the least idea of books or\\n', 'literature.\\n', '\\n', 'In about ten weeks time, I was able to understand most of his questions;\\n', 'and in three months, could give him some tolerable answers.  He was\\n', 'extremely curious to know “from what part of the country I came, and how\\n', 'I was taught to imitate a rational creature; because the _Yahoos_ (whom\\n', 'he saw I exactly resembled in my head, hands, and face, that were only\\n', 'visible), with some appearance of cunning, and the strongest disposition\\n', 'to mischief, were observed to be the most unteachable of all brutes.”  I\\n', 'answered, “that I came over the sea, from a far place, with many others\\n', 'of my own kind, in a great hollow vessel made of the bodies of trees:\\n', 'that my companions forced me to land on this coast, and then left me to\\n', 'shift for myself.”  It was with some difficulty, and by the help of many\\n', 'signs, that I brought him to understand me.  He replied, “that I must\\n', 'needs be mistaken, or that I said the thing which was not;” for they have\\n', 'no word in their language to express lying or falsehood.  “He knew it was\\n', 'impossible that there could be a country beyond the sea, or that a parcel\\n', 'of brutes could move a wooden vessel whither they pleased upon water.  He\\n', 'was sure no _Houyhnhnm_ alive could make such a vessel, nor would trust\\n', '_Yahoos_ to manage it.”\\n', '\\n', 'The word _Houyhnhnm_, in their tongue, signifies a _horse_, and, in its\\n', 'etymology, the _perfection of nature_.  I told my master, “that I was at\\n', 'a loss for expression, but would improve as fast as I could; and hoped,\\n', 'in a short time, I should be able to tell him wonders.”  He was pleased\\n', 'to direct his own mare, his colt, and foal, and the servants of the\\n', 'family, to take all opportunities of instructing me; and every day, for\\n', 'two or three hours, he was at the same pains himself.  Several horses and\\n', 'mares of quality in the neighbourhood came often to our house, upon the\\n', 'report spread of “a wonderful _Yahoo_, that could speak like a\\n', '_Houyhnhnm_, and seemed, in his words and actions, to discover some\\n', 'glimmerings of reason.”  These delighted to converse with me: they put\\n', 'many questions, and received such answers as I was able to return.  By\\n', 'all these advantages I made so great a progress, that, in five months\\n', 'from my arrival I understood whatever was spoken, and could express\\n', 'myself tolerably well.\\n', '\\n', 'The _Houyhnhnms_, who came to visit my master out of a design of seeing\\n', 'and talking with me, could hardly believe me to be a right _Yahoo_,\\n', 'because my body had a different covering from others of my kind.  They\\n', 'were astonished to observe me without the usual hair or skin, except on\\n', 'my head, face, and hands; but I discovered that secret to my master upon\\n', 'an accident which happened about a fortnight before.\\n', '\\n', 'I have already told the reader, that every night, when the family were\\n', 'gone to bed, it was my custom to strip, and cover myself with my clothes.\\n', 'It happened, one morning early, that my master sent for me by the sorrel\\n', 'nag, who was his valet.  When he came I was fast asleep, my clothes\\n', 'fallen off on one side, and my shirt above my waist.  I awaked at the\\n', 'noise he made, and observed him to deliver his message in some disorder;\\n', 'after which he went to my master, and in a great fright gave him a very\\n', 'confused account of what he had seen.  This I presently discovered, for,\\n', 'going as soon as I was dressed to pay my attendance upon his honour, he\\n', 'asked me “the meaning of what his servant had reported, that I was not\\n', 'the same thing when I slept, as I appeared to be at other times; that his\\n', 'vale assured him, some part of me was white, some yellow, at least not so\\n', 'white, and some brown.”\\n', '\\n', 'I had hitherto concealed the secret of my dress, in order to distinguish\\n', 'myself, as much as possible, from that cursed race of _Yahoos_; but now I\\n', 'found it in vain to do so any longer.  Besides, I considered that my\\n', 'clothes and shoes would soon wear out, which already were in a declining\\n', 'condition, and must be supplied by some contrivance from the hides of\\n', '_Yahoos_, or other brutes; whereby the whole secret would be known.  I\\n', 'therefore told my master, “that in the country whence I came, those of my\\n', 'kind always covered their bodies with the hairs of certain animals\\n', 'prepared by art, as well for decency as to avoid the inclemencies of air,\\n', 'both hot and cold; of which, as to my own person, I would give him\\n', 'immediate conviction, if he pleased to command me: only desiring his\\n', 'excuse, if I did not expose those parts that nature taught us to\\n', 'conceal.”  He said, “my discourse was all very strange, but especially\\n', 'the last part; for he could not understand, why nature should teach us to\\n', 'conceal what nature had given; that neither himself nor family were\\n', 'ashamed of any parts of their bodies; but, however, I might do as I\\n', 'pleased.”  Whereupon I first unbuttoned my coat, and pulled it off.  I\\n', 'did the same with my waistcoat.  I drew off my shoes, stockings, and\\n', 'breeches.  I let my shirt down to my waist, and drew up the bottom;\\n', 'fastening it like a girdle about my middle, to hide my nakedness.\\n', '\\n', 'My master observed the whole performance with great signs of curiosity\\n', 'and admiration.  He took up all my clothes in his pastern, one piece\\n', 'after another, and examined them diligently; he then stroked my body very\\n', 'gently, and looked round me several times; after which, he said, it was\\n', 'plain I must be a perfect _Yahoo_; but that I differed very much from the\\n', 'rest of my species in the softness, whiteness, and smoothness of my skin;\\n', 'my want of hair in several parts of my body; the shape and shortness of\\n', 'my claws behind and before; and my affectation of walking continually on\\n', 'my two hinder feet.  He desired to see no more; and gave me leave to put\\n', 'on my clothes again, for I was shuddering with cold.\\n', '\\n', 'I expressed my uneasiness at his giving me so often the appellation of\\n', '_Yahoo_, an odious animal, for which I had so utter a hatred and\\n', 'contempt: I begged he would forbear applying that word to me, and make\\n', 'the same order in his family and among his friends whom he suffered to\\n', 'see me.  I requested likewise, “that the secret of my having a false\\n', 'covering to my body, might be known to none but himself, at least as long\\n', 'as my present clothing should last; for as to what the sorrel nag, his\\n', 'valet, had observed, his honour might command him to conceal it.”\\n', '\\n', 'All this my master very graciously consented to; and thus the secret was\\n', 'kept till my clothes began to wear out, which I was forced to supply by\\n', 'several contrivances that shall hereafter be mentioned.  In the meantime,\\n', 'he desired “I would go on with my utmost diligence to learn their\\n', 'language, because he was more astonished at my capacity for speech and\\n', 'reason, than at the figure of my body, whether it were covered or not;”\\n', 'adding, “that he waited with some impatience to hear the wonders which I\\n', 'promised to tell him.”\\n', '\\n', 'Thenceforward he doubled the pains he had been at to instruct me: he\\n', 'brought me into all company, and made them treat me with civility;\\n', '“because,” as he told them, privately, “this would put me into good\\n', 'humour, and make me more diverting.”\\n', '\\n', 'Every day, when I waited on him, beside the trouble he was at in\\n', 'teaching, he would ask me several questions concerning myself, which I\\n', 'answered as well as I could, and by these means he had already received\\n', 'some general ideas, though very imperfect.  It would be tedious to relate\\n', 'the several steps by which I advanced to a more regular conversation; but\\n', 'the first account I gave of myself in any order and length was to this\\n', 'purpose:\\n', '\\n', '“That I came from a very far country, as I already had attempted to tell\\n', 'him, with about fifty more of my own species; that we travelled upon the\\n', 'seas in a great hollow vessel made of wood, and larger than his honour’s\\n', 'house.  I described the ship to him in the best terms I could, and\\n', 'explained, by the help of my handkerchief displayed, how it was driven\\n', 'forward by the wind.  That upon a quarrel among us, I was set on shore on\\n', 'this coast, where I walked forward, without knowing whither, till he\\n', 'delivered me from the persecution of those execrable _Yahoos_.”  He asked\\n', 'me, “who made the ship, and how it was possible that the _Houyhnhnms_ of\\n', 'my country would leave it to the management of brutes?”  My answer was,\\n', '“that I durst proceed no further in my relation, unless he would give me\\n', 'his word and honour that he would not be offended, and then I would tell\\n', 'him the wonders I had so often promised.”  He agreed; and I went on by\\n', 'assuring him, that the ship was made by creatures like myself; who, in\\n', 'all the countries I had travelled, as well as in my own, were the only\\n', 'governing rational animals; and that upon my arrival hither, I was as\\n', 'much astonished to see the _Houyhnhnms_ act like rational beings, as he,\\n', 'or his friends, could be, in finding some marks of reason in a creature\\n', 'he was pleased to call a _Yahoo_; to which I owned my resemblance in\\n', 'every part, but could not account for their degenerate and brutal nature.\\n', 'I said farther, “that if good fortune ever restored me to my native\\n', 'country, to relate my travels hither, as I resolved to do, everybody\\n', 'would believe, that I said the thing that was not, that I invented the\\n', 'story out of my own head; and (with all possible respect to himself, his\\n', 'family, and friends, and under his promise of not being offended) our\\n', 'countrymen would hardly think it probable that a _Houyhnhnm_ should be\\n', 'the presiding creature of a nation, and a _Yahoo_ the brute.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER IV.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The Houyhnhnm’s notion of truth and falsehood.  The author’s discourse\\n', 'disapproved by his master.  The author gives a more particular account of\\n', 'himself, and the accidents of his voyage.\\n', '\\n', 'My master heard me with great appearances of uneasiness in his\\n', 'countenance; because doubting, or not believing, are so little known in\\n', 'this country, that the inhabitants cannot tell how to behave themselves\\n', 'under such circumstances.  And I remember, in frequent discourses with my\\n', 'master concerning the nature of manhood in other parts of the world,\\n', 'having occasion to talk of lying and false representation, it was with\\n', 'much difficulty that he comprehended what I meant, although he had\\n', 'otherwise a most acute judgment.  For he argued thus: “that the use of\\n', 'speech was to make us understand one another, and to receive information\\n', 'of facts; now, if any one said the thing which was not, these ends were\\n', 'defeated, because I cannot properly be said to understand him; and I am\\n', 'so far from receiving information, that he leaves me worse than in\\n', 'ignorance; for I am led to believe a thing black, when it is white, and\\n', 'short, when it is long.”  And these were all the notions he had\\n', 'concerning that faculty of lying, so perfectly well understood, and so\\n', 'universally practised, among human creatures.\\n', '\\n', 'To return from this digression.  When I asserted that the _Yahoos_ were\\n', 'the only governing animals in my country, which my master said was\\n', 'altogether past his conception, he desired to know, “whether we had\\n', '_Houyhnhnms_ among us, and what was their employment?”  I told him, “we\\n', 'had great numbers; that in summer they grazed in the fields, and in\\n', 'winter were kept in houses with hay and oats, where _Yahoo_ servants were\\n', 'employed to rub their skins smooth, comb their manes, pick their feet,\\n', 'serve them with food, and make their beds.”  “I understand you well,”\\n', 'said my master: “it is now very plain, from all you have spoken, that\\n', 'whatever share of reason the _Yahoos_ pretend to, the _Houyhnhnms_ are\\n', 'your masters; I heartily wish our _Yahoos_ would be so tractable.”  I\\n', 'begged “his honour would please to excuse me from proceeding any further,\\n', 'because I was very certain that the account he expected from me would be\\n', 'highly displeasing.”  But he insisted in commanding me to let him know\\n', 'the best and the worst.  I told him “he should be obeyed.”  I owned “that\\n', 'the _Houyhnhnms_ among us, whom we called horses, were the most generous\\n', 'and comely animals we had; that they excelled in strength and swiftness;\\n', 'and when they belonged to persons of quality, were employed in\\n', 'travelling, racing, or drawing chariots; they were treated with much\\n', 'kindness and care, till they fell into diseases, or became foundered in\\n', 'the feet; but then they were sold, and used to all kind of drudgery till\\n', 'they died; after which their skins were stripped, and sold for what they\\n', 'were worth, and their bodies left to be devoured by dogs and birds of\\n', 'prey.  But the common race of horses had not so good fortune, being kept\\n', 'by farmers and carriers, and other mean people, who put them to greater\\n', 'labour, and fed them worse.”  I described, as well as I could, our way of\\n', 'riding; the shape and use of a bridle, a saddle, a spur, and a whip; of\\n', 'harness and wheels.  I added, “that we fastened plates of a certain hard\\n', 'substance, called iron, at the bottom of their feet, to preserve their\\n', 'hoofs from being broken by the stony ways, on which we often travelled.”\\n', '\\n', 'My master, after some expressions of great indignation, wondered “how we\\n', 'dared to venture upon a _Houyhnhnm’s_ back; for he was sure, that the\\n', 'weakest servant in his house would be able to shake off the strongest\\n', '_Yahoo_; or by lying down and rolling on his back, squeeze the brute to\\n', 'death.”  I answered “that our horses were trained up, from three or four\\n', 'years old, to the several uses we intended them for; that if any of them\\n', 'proved intolerably vicious, they were employed for carriages; that they\\n', 'were severely beaten, while they were young, for any mischievous tricks;\\n', 'that the males, designed for the common use of riding or draught, were\\n', 'generally castrated about two years after their birth, to take down their\\n', 'spirits, and make them more tame and gentle; that they were indeed\\n', 'sensible of rewards and punishments; but his honour would please to\\n', 'consider, that they had not the least tincture of reason, any more than\\n', 'the _Yahoos_ in this country.”\\n', '\\n', 'It put me to the pains of many circumlocutions, to give my master a right\\n', 'idea of what I spoke; for their language does not abound in variety of\\n', 'words, because their wants and passions are fewer than among us.  But it\\n', 'is impossible to express his noble resentment at our savage treatment of\\n', 'the _Houyhnhnm_ race; particularly after I had explained the manner and\\n', 'use of castrating horses among us, to hinder them from propagating their\\n', 'kind, and to render them more servile.  He said, “if it were possible\\n', 'there could be any country where _Yahoos_ alone were endued with reason,\\n', 'they certainly must be the governing animal; because reason in time will\\n', 'always prevail against brutal strength.  But, considering the frame of\\n', 'our bodies, and especially of mine, he thought no creature of equal bulk\\n', 'was so ill-contrived for employing that reason in the common offices of\\n', 'life;” whereupon he desired to know “whether those among whom I lived\\n', 'resembled me, or the _Yahoos_ of his country?”  I assured him, “that I\\n', 'was as well shaped as most of my age; but the younger, and the females,\\n', 'were much more soft and tender, and the skins of the latter generally as\\n', 'white as milk.”  He said, “I differed indeed from other _Yahoos_, being\\n', 'much more cleanly, and not altogether so deformed; but, in point of real\\n', 'advantage, he thought I differed for the worse: that my nails were of no\\n', 'use either to my fore or hinder feet; as to my fore feet, he could not\\n', 'properly call them by that name, for he never observed me to walk upon\\n', 'them; that they were too soft to bear the ground; that I generally went\\n', 'with them uncovered; neither was the covering I sometimes wore on them of\\n', 'the same shape, or so strong as that on my feet behind: that I could not\\n', 'walk with any security, for if either of my hinder feet slipped, I must\\n', 'inevitably fail.”  He then began to find fault with other parts of my\\n', 'body: “the flatness of my face, the prominence of my nose, mine eyes\\n', 'placed directly in front, so that I could not look on either side without\\n', 'turning my head: that I was not able to feed myself, without lifting one\\n', 'of my fore-feet to my mouth: and therefore nature had placed those joints\\n', 'to answer that necessity.  He knew not what could be the use of those\\n', 'several clefts and divisions in my feet behind; that these were too soft\\n', 'to bear the hardness and sharpness of stones, without a covering made\\n', 'from the skin of some other brute; that my whole body wanted a fence\\n', 'against heat and cold, which I was forced to put on and off every day,\\n', 'with tediousness and trouble: and lastly, that he observed every animal\\n', 'in this country naturally to abhor the _Yahoos_, whom the weaker avoided,\\n', 'and the stronger drove from them.  So that, supposing us to have the gift\\n', 'of reason, he could not see how it were possible to cure that natural\\n', 'antipathy, which every creature discovered against us; nor consequently\\n', 'how we could tame and render them serviceable.  However, he would,” as he\\n', 'said, “debate the matter no farther, because he was more desirous to know\\n', 'my own story, the country where I was born, and the several actions and\\n', 'events of my life, before I came hither.”\\n', '\\n', 'I assured him, “how extremely desirous I was that he should be satisfied\\n', 'on every point; but I doubted much, whether it would be possible for me\\n', 'to explain myself on several subjects, whereof his honour could have no\\n', 'conception; because I saw nothing in his country to which I could\\n', 'resemble them; that, however, I would do my best, and strive to express\\n', 'myself by similitudes, humbly desiring his assistance when I wanted\\n', 'proper words;” which he was pleased to promise me.\\n', '\\n', 'I said, “my birth was of honest parents, in an island called England;\\n', 'which was remote from his country, as many days’ journey as the strongest\\n', 'of his honour’s servants could travel in the annual course of the sun;\\n', 'that I was bred a surgeon, whose trade it is to cure wounds and hurts in\\n', 'the body, gotten by accident or violence; that my country was governed by\\n', 'a female man, whom we called queen; that I left it to get riches, whereby\\n', 'I might maintain myself and family, when I should return; that, in my\\n', 'last voyage, I was commander of the ship, and had about fifty _Yahoos_\\n', 'under me, many of which died at sea, and I was forced to supply them by\\n', 'others picked out from several nations; that our ship was twice in danger\\n', 'of being sunk, the first time by a great storm, and the second by\\n', 'striking against a rock.”  Here my master interposed, by asking me, “how\\n', 'I could persuade strangers, out of different countries, to venture with\\n', 'me, after the losses I had sustained, and the hazards I had run?”  I\\n', 'said, “they were fellows of desperate fortunes, forced to fly from the\\n', 'places of their birth on account of their poverty or their crimes.  Some\\n', 'were undone by lawsuits; others spent all they had in drinking, whoring,\\n', 'and gaming; others fled for treason; many for murder, theft, poisoning,\\n', 'robbery, perjury, forgery, coining false money, for committing rapes, or\\n', 'sodomy; for flying from their colours, or deserting to the enemy; and\\n', 'most of them had broken prison; none of these durst return to their\\n', 'native countries, for fear of being hanged, or of starving in a jail; and\\n', 'therefore they were under the necessity of seeking a livelihood in other\\n', 'places.”\\n', '\\n', 'During this discourse, my master was pleased to interrupt me several\\n', 'times.  I had made use of many circumlocutions in describing to him the\\n', 'nature of the several crimes for which most of our crew had been forced\\n', 'to fly their country.  This labour took up several days’ conversation,\\n', 'before he was able to comprehend me.  He was wholly at a loss to know\\n', 'what could be the use or necessity of practising those vices.  To clear\\n', 'up which, I endeavoured to give some ideas of the desire of power and\\n', 'riches; of the terrible effects of lust, intemperance, malice, and envy.\\n', 'All this I was forced to define and describe by putting cases and making\\n', 'suppositions.  After which, like one whose imagination was struck with\\n', 'something never seen or heard of before, he would lift up his eyes with\\n', 'amazement and indignation.  Power, government, war, law, punishment, and\\n', 'a thousand other things, had no terms wherein that language could express\\n', 'them, which made the difficulty almost insuperable, to give my master any\\n', 'conception of what I meant.  But being of an excellent understanding,\\n', 'much improved by contemplation and converse, he at last arrived at a\\n', 'competent knowledge of what human nature, in our parts of the world, is\\n', 'capable to perform, and desired I would give him some particular account\\n', 'of that land which we call Europe, but especially of my own country.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER V.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The author at his master’s command, informs him of the state of England.\\n', 'The causes of war among the princes of Europe.  The author begins to\\n', 'explain the English constitution.\\n', '\\n', 'The reader may please to observe, that the following extract of many\\n', 'conversations I had with my master, contains a summary of the most\\n', 'material points which were discoursed at several times for above two\\n', 'years; his honour often desiring fuller satisfaction, as I farther\\n', 'improved in the _Houyhnhnm_ tongue.  I laid before him, as well as I\\n', 'could, the whole state of Europe; I discoursed of trade and manufactures,\\n', 'of arts and sciences; and the answers I gave to all the questions he\\n', 'made, as they arose upon several subjects, were a fund of conversation\\n', 'not to be exhausted.  But I shall here only set down the substance of\\n', 'what passed between us concerning my own country, reducing it in order as\\n', 'well as I can, without any regard to time or other circumstances, while I\\n', 'strictly adhere to truth.  My only concern is, that I shall hardly be\\n', 'able to do justice to my master’s arguments and expressions, which must\\n', 'needs suffer by my want of capacity, as well as by a translation into our\\n', 'barbarous English.\\n', '\\n', 'In obedience, therefore, to his honour’s commands, I related to him the\\n', 'Revolution under the Prince of Orange; the long war with France, entered\\n', 'into by the said prince, and renewed by his successor, the present queen,\\n', 'wherein the greatest powers of Christendom were engaged, and which still\\n', 'continued: I computed, at his request, “that about a million of _Yahoos_\\n', 'might have been killed in the whole progress of it; and perhaps a hundred\\n', 'or more cities taken, and five times as many ships burnt or sunk.”\\n', '\\n', 'He asked me, “what were the usual causes or motives that made one country\\n', 'go to war with another?”  I answered “they were innumerable; but I should\\n', 'only mention a few of the chief.  Sometimes the ambition of princes, who\\n', 'never think they have land or people enough to govern; sometimes the\\n', 'corruption of ministers, who engage their master in a war, in order to\\n', 'stifle or divert the clamour of the subjects against their evil\\n', 'administration.  Difference in opinions has cost many millions of lives:\\n', 'for instance, whether flesh be bread, or bread be flesh; whether the\\n', 'juice of a certain berry be blood or wine; whether whistling be a vice or\\n', 'a virtue; whether it be better to kiss a post, or throw it into the fire;\\n', 'what is the best colour for a coat, whether black, white, red, or gray;\\n', 'and whether it should be long or short, narrow or wide, dirty or clean;\\n', 'with many more.  Neither are any wars so furious and bloody, or of so\\n', 'long a continuance, as those occasioned by difference in opinion,\\n', 'especially if it be in things indifferent.\\n', '\\n', '“Sometimes the quarrel between two princes is to decide which of them\\n', 'shall dispossess a third of his dominions, where neither of them pretend\\n', 'to any right.  Sometimes one prince quarrels with another for fear the\\n', 'other should quarrel with him.  Sometimes a war is entered upon, because\\n', 'the enemy is too strong; and sometimes, because he is too weak.\\n', 'Sometimes our neighbours want the things which we have, or have the\\n', 'things which we want, and we both fight, till they take ours, or give us\\n', 'theirs.  It is a very justifiable cause of a war, to invade a country\\n', 'after the people have been wasted by famine, destroyed by pestilence, or\\n', 'embroiled by factions among themselves.  It is justifiable to enter into\\n', 'war against our nearest ally, when one of his towns lies convenient for\\n', 'us, or a territory of land, that would render our dominions round and\\n', 'complete.  If a prince sends forces into a nation, where the people are\\n', 'poor and ignorant, he may lawfully put half of them to death, and make\\n', 'slaves of the rest, in order to civilize and reduce them from their\\n', 'barbarous way of living.  It is a very kingly, honourable, and frequent\\n', 'practice, when one prince desires the assistance of another, to secure\\n', 'him against an invasion, that the assistant, when he has driven out the\\n', 'invader, should seize on the dominions himself, and kill, imprison, or\\n', 'banish, the prince he came to relieve.  Alliance by blood, or marriage,\\n', 'is a frequent cause of war between princes; and the nearer the kindred\\n', 'is, the greater their disposition to quarrel; poor nations are hungry,\\n', 'and rich nations are proud; and pride and hunger will ever be at\\n', 'variance.  For these reasons, the trade of a soldier is held the most\\n', 'honourable of all others; because a soldier is a _Yahoo_ hired to kill,\\n', 'in cold blood, as many of his own species, who have never offended him,\\n', 'as possibly he can.\\n', '\\n', '“There is likewise a kind of beggarly princes in Europe, not able to make\\n', 'war by themselves, who hire out their troops to richer nations, for so\\n', 'much a day to each man; of which they keep three-fourths to themselves,\\n', 'and it is the best part of their maintenance: such are those in many\\n', 'northern parts of Europe.”\\n', '\\n', '“What you have told me,” said my master, “upon the subject of war, does\\n', 'indeed discover most admirably the effects of that reason you pretend to:\\n', 'however, it is happy that the shame is greater than the danger; and that\\n', 'nature has left you utterly incapable of doing much mischief.  For, your\\n', 'mouths lying flat with your faces, you can hardly bite each other to any\\n', 'purpose, unless by consent.  Then as to the claws upon your feet before\\n', 'and behind, they are so short and tender, that one of our _Yahoos_ would\\n', 'drive a dozen of yours before him.  And therefore, in recounting the\\n', 'numbers of those who have been killed in battle, I cannot but think you\\n', 'have said the thing which is not.”\\n', '\\n', 'I could not forbear shaking my head, and smiling a little at his\\n', 'ignorance.  And being no stranger to the art of war, I gave him a\\n', 'description of cannons, culverins, muskets, carabines, pistols, bullets,\\n', 'powder, swords, bayonets, battles, sieges, retreats, attacks, undermines,\\n', 'countermines, bombardments, sea fights, ships sunk with a thousand men,\\n', 'twenty thousand killed on each side, dying groans, limbs flying in the\\n', 'air, smoke, noise, confusion, trampling to death under horses’ feet,\\n', 'flight, pursuit, victory; fields strewed with carcases, left for food to\\n', 'dogs and wolves and birds of prey; plundering, stripping, ravishing,\\n', 'burning, and destroying.  And to set forth the valour of my own dear\\n', 'countrymen, I assured him, “that I had seen them blow up a hundred\\n', 'enemies at once in a siege, and as many in a ship, and beheld the dead\\n', 'bodies drop down in pieces from the clouds, to the great diversion of the\\n', 'spectators.”\\n', '\\n', 'I was going on to more particulars, when my master commanded me silence.\\n', 'He said, “whoever understood the nature of _Yahoos_, might easily believe\\n', 'it possible for so vile an animal to be capable of every action I had\\n', 'named, if their strength and cunning equalled their malice.  But as my\\n', 'discourse had increased his abhorrence of the whole species, so he found\\n', 'it gave him a disturbance in his mind to which he was wholly a stranger\\n', 'before.  He thought his ears, being used to such abominable words, might,\\n', 'by degrees, admit them with less detestation: that although he hated the\\n', '_Yahoos_ of this country, yet he no more blamed them for their odious\\n', 'qualities, than he did a _gnnayh_ (a bird of prey) for its cruelty, or a\\n', 'sharp stone for cutting his hoof.  But when a creature pretending to\\n', 'reason could be capable of such enormities, he dreaded lest the\\n', 'corruption of that faculty might be worse than brutality itself.  He\\n', 'seemed therefore confident, that, instead of reason we were only\\n', 'possessed of some quality fitted to increase our natural vices; as the\\n', 'reflection from a troubled stream returns the image of an ill shapen\\n', 'body, not only larger but more distorted.”\\n', '\\n', 'He added, “that he had heard too much upon the subject of war, both in\\n', 'this and some former discourses.  There was another point, which a little\\n', 'perplexed him at present.  I had informed him, that some of our crew left\\n', 'their country on account of being ruined by law; that I had already\\n', 'explained the meaning of the word; but he was at a loss how it should\\n', 'come to pass, that the law, which was intended for every man’s\\n', 'preservation, should be any man’s ruin.  Therefore he desired to be\\n', 'further satisfied what I meant by law, and the dispensers thereof,\\n', 'according to the present practice in my own country; because he thought\\n', 'nature and reason were sufficient guides for a reasonable animal, as we\\n', 'pretended to be, in showing us what he ought to do, and what to avoid.”\\n', '\\n', 'I assured his honour, “that the law was a science in which I had not much\\n', 'conversed, further than by employing advocates, in vain, upon some\\n', 'injustices that had been done me: however, I would give him all the\\n', 'satisfaction I was able.”\\n', '\\n', 'I said, “there was a society of men among us, bred up from their youth in\\n', 'the art of proving, by words multiplied for the purpose, that white is\\n', 'black, and black is white, according as they are paid.  To this society\\n', 'all the rest of the people are slaves.  For example, if my neighbour has\\n', 'a mind to my cow, he has a lawyer to prove that he ought to have my cow\\n', 'from me.  I must then hire another to defend my right, it being against\\n', 'all rules of law that any man should be allowed to speak for himself.\\n', 'Now, in this case, I, who am the right owner, lie under two great\\n', 'disadvantages: first, my lawyer, being practised almost from his cradle\\n', 'in defending falsehood, is quite out of his element when he would be an\\n', 'advocate for justice, which is an unnatural office he always attempts\\n', 'with great awkwardness, if not with ill-will.  The second disadvantage\\n', 'is, that my lawyer must proceed with great caution, or else he will be\\n', 'reprimanded by the judges, and abhorred by his brethren, as one that\\n', 'would lessen the practice of the law.  And therefore I have but two\\n', 'methods to preserve my cow.  The first is, to gain over my adversary’s\\n', 'lawyer with a double fee, who will then betray his client by insinuating\\n', 'that he hath justice on his side.  The second way is for my lawyer to\\n', 'make my cause appear as unjust as he can, by allowing the cow to belong\\n', 'to my adversary: and this, if it be skilfully done, will certainly\\n', 'bespeak the favour of the bench.  Now your honour is to know, that these\\n', 'judges are persons appointed to decide all controversies of property, as\\n', 'well as for the trial of criminals, and picked out from the most\\n', 'dexterous lawyers, who are grown old or lazy; and having been biassed all\\n', 'their lives against truth and equity, lie under such a fatal necessity of\\n', 'favouring fraud, perjury, and oppression, that I have known some of them\\n', 'refuse a large bribe from the side where justice lay, rather than injure\\n', 'the faculty, by doing any thing unbecoming their nature or their office.\\n', '\\n', '“It is a maxim among these lawyers that whatever has been done before,\\n', 'may legally be done again: and therefore they take special care to record\\n', 'all the decisions formerly made against common justice, and the general\\n', 'reason of mankind.  These, under the name of precedents, they produce as\\n', 'authorities to justify the most iniquitous opinions; and the judges never\\n', 'fail of directing accordingly.\\n', '\\n', '“In pleading, they studiously avoid entering into the merits of the\\n', 'cause; but are loud, violent, and tedious, in dwelling upon all\\n', 'circumstances which are not to the purpose.  For instance, in the case\\n', 'already mentioned; they never desire to know what claim or title my\\n', 'adversary has to my cow; but whether the said cow were red or black; her\\n', 'horns long or short; whether the field I graze her in be round or square;\\n', 'whether she was milked at home or abroad; what diseases she is subject\\n', 'to, and the like; after which they consult precedents, adjourn the cause\\n', 'from time to time, and in ten, twenty, or thirty years, come to an issue.\\n', '\\n', '“It is likewise to be observed, that this society has a peculiar cant and\\n', 'jargon of their own, that no other mortal can understand, and wherein all\\n', 'their laws are written, which they take special care to multiply; whereby\\n', 'they have wholly confounded the very essence of truth and falsehood, of\\n', 'right and wrong; so that it will take thirty years to decide, whether the\\n', 'field left me by my ancestors for six generations belongs to me, or to a\\n', 'stranger three hundred miles off.\\n', '\\n', '“In the trial of persons accused for crimes against the state, the method\\n', 'is much more short and commendable: the judge first sends to sound the\\n', 'disposition of those in power, after which he can easily hang or save a\\n', 'criminal, strictly preserving all due forms of law.”\\n', '\\n', 'Here my master interposing, said, “it was a pity, that creatures endowed\\n', 'with such prodigious abilities of mind, as these lawyers, by the\\n', 'description I gave of them, must certainly be, were not rather encouraged\\n', 'to be instructors of others in wisdom and knowledge.”  In answer to which\\n', 'I assured his honour, “that in all points out of their own trade, they\\n', 'were usually the most ignorant and stupid generation among us, the most\\n', 'despicable in common conversation, avowed enemies to all knowledge and\\n', 'learning, and equally disposed to pervert the general reason of mankind\\n', 'in every other subject of discourse as in that of their own profession.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER VI.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'A continuation of the state of England under Queen Anne.  The character\\n', 'of a first minister of state in European courts.\\n', '\\n', 'My master was yet wholly at a loss to understand what motives could\\n', 'incite this race of lawyers to perplex, disquiet, and weary themselves,\\n', 'and engage in a confederacy of injustice, merely for the sake of injuring\\n', 'their fellow-animals; neither could he comprehend what I meant in saying,\\n', 'they did it for hire.  Whereupon I was at much pains to describe to him\\n', 'the use of money, the materials it was made of, and the value of the\\n', 'metals; “that when a _Yahoo_ had got a great store of this precious\\n', 'substance, he was able to purchase whatever he had a mind to; the finest\\n', 'clothing, the noblest houses, great tracts of land, the most costly meats\\n', 'and drinks, and have his choice of the most beautiful females.  Therefore\\n', 'since money alone was able to perform all these feats, our _Yahoos_\\n', 'thought they could never have enough of it to spend, or to save, as they\\n', 'found themselves inclined, from their natural bent either to profusion or\\n', 'avarice; that the rich man enjoyed the fruit of the poor man’s labour,\\n', 'and the latter were a thousand to one in proportion to the former; that\\n', 'the bulk of our people were forced to live miserably, by labouring every\\n', 'day for small wages, to make a few live plentifully.”\\n', '\\n', 'I enlarged myself much on these, and many other particulars to the same\\n', 'purpose; but his honour was still to seek; for he went upon a\\n', 'supposition, that all animals had a title to their share in the\\n', 'productions of the earth, and especially those who presided over the\\n', 'rest.  Therefore he desired I would let him know, “what these costly\\n', 'meats were, and how any of us happened to want them?”  Whereupon I\\n', 'enumerated as many sorts as came into my head, with the various methods\\n', 'of dressing them, which could not be done without sending vessels by sea\\n', 'to every part of the world, as well for liquors to drink as for sauces\\n', 'and innumerable other conveniences.  I assured him “that this whole globe\\n', 'of earth must be at least three times gone round before one of our better\\n', 'female _Yahoos_ could get her breakfast, or a cup to put it in.”  He said\\n', '“that must needs be a miserable country which cannot furnish food for its\\n', 'own inhabitants.  But what he chiefly wondered at was, how such vast\\n', 'tracts of ground as I described should be wholly without fresh water, and\\n', 'the people put to the necessity of sending over the sea for drink.”  I\\n', 'replied “that England (the dear place of my nativity) was computed to\\n', 'produce three times the quantity of food more than its inhabitants are\\n', 'able to consume, as well as liquors extracted from grain, or pressed out\\n', 'of the fruit of certain trees, which made excellent drink, and the same\\n', 'proportion in every other convenience of life.  But, in order to feed the\\n', 'luxury and intemperance of the males, and the vanity of the females, we\\n', 'sent away the greatest part of our necessary things to other countries,\\n', 'whence, in return, we brought the materials of diseases, folly, and vice,\\n', 'to spend among ourselves.  Hence it follows of necessity, that vast\\n', 'numbers of our people are compelled to seek their livelihood by begging,\\n', 'robbing, stealing, cheating, pimping, flattering, suborning, forswearing,\\n', 'forging, gaming, lying, fawning, hectoring, voting, scribbling,\\n', 'star-gazing, poisoning, whoring, canting, libelling, freethinking, and\\n', 'the like occupations:” every one of which terms I was at much pains to\\n', 'make him understand.\\n', '\\n', '“That wine was not imported among us from foreign countries to supply the\\n', 'want of water or other drinks, but because it was a sort of liquid which\\n', 'made us merry by putting us out of our senses, diverted all melancholy\\n', 'thoughts, begat wild extravagant imaginations in the brain, raised our\\n', 'hopes and banished our fears, suspended every office of reason for a\\n', 'time, and deprived us of the use of our limbs, till we fell into a\\n', 'profound sleep; although it must be confessed, that we always awaked sick\\n', 'and dispirited; and that the use of this liquor filled us with diseases\\n', 'which made our lives uncomfortable and short.\\n', '\\n', '“But beside all this, the bulk of our people supported themselves by\\n', 'furnishing the necessities or conveniences of life to the rich and to\\n', 'each other.  For instance, when I am at home, and dressed as I ought to\\n', 'be, I carry on my body the workmanship of a hundred tradesmen; the\\n', 'building and furniture of my house employ as many more, and five times\\n', 'the number to adorn my wife.”\\n', '\\n', 'I was going on to tell him of another sort of people, who get their\\n', 'livelihood by attending the sick, having, upon some occasions, informed\\n', 'his honour that many of my crew had died of diseases.  But here it was\\n', 'with the utmost difficulty that I brought him to apprehend what I meant.\\n', '“He could easily conceive, that a _Houyhnhnm_, grew weak and heavy a few\\n', 'days before his death, or by some accident might hurt a limb; but that\\n', 'nature, who works all things to perfection, should suffer any pains to\\n', 'breed in our bodies, he thought impossible, and desired to know the\\n', 'reason of so unaccountable an evil.”\\n', '\\n', 'I told him “we fed on a thousand things which operated contrary to each\\n', 'other; that we ate when we were not hungry, and drank without the\\n', 'provocation of thirst; that we sat whole nights drinking strong liquors,\\n', 'without eating a bit, which disposed us to sloth, inflamed our bodies,\\n', 'and precipitated or prevented digestion; that prostitute female _Yahoos_\\n', 'acquired a certain malady, which bred rottenness in the bones of those\\n', 'who fell into their embraces; that this, and many other diseases, were\\n', 'propagated from father to son; so that great numbers came into the world\\n', 'with complicated maladies upon them; that it would be endless to give him\\n', 'a catalogue of all diseases incident to human bodies, for they would not\\n', 'be fewer than five or six hundred, spread over every limb and joint—in\\n', 'short, every part, external and intestine, having diseases appropriated\\n', 'to itself.  To remedy which, there was a sort of people bred up among us\\n', 'in the profession, or pretence, of curing the sick.  And because I had\\n', 'some skill in the faculty, I would, in gratitude to his honour, let him\\n', 'know the whole mystery and method by which they proceed.\\n', '\\n', '“Their fundamental is, that all diseases arise from repletion; whence\\n', 'they conclude, that a great evacuation of the body is necessary, either\\n', 'through the natural passage or upwards at the mouth.  Their next business\\n', 'is from herbs, minerals, gums, oils, shells, salts, juices, sea-weed,\\n', 'excrements, barks of trees, serpents, toads, frogs, spiders, dead men’s\\n', 'flesh and bones, birds, beasts, and fishes, to form a composition, for\\n', 'smell and taste, the most abominable, nauseous, and detestable, they can\\n', 'possibly contrive, which the stomach immediately rejects with loathing,\\n', 'and this they call a vomit; or else, from the same store-house, with some\\n', 'other poisonous additions, they command us to take in at the orifice\\n', 'above or below (just as the physician then happens to be disposed) a\\n', 'medicine equally annoying and disgustful to the bowels; which, relaxing\\n', 'the belly, drives down all before it; and this they call a purge, or a\\n', 'clyster.  For nature (as the physicians allege) having intended the\\n', 'superior anterior orifice only for the intromission of solids and\\n', 'liquids, and the inferior posterior for ejection, these artists\\n', 'ingeniously considering that in all diseases nature is forced out of her\\n', 'seat, therefore, to replace her in it, the body must be treated in a\\n', 'manner directly contrary, by interchanging the use of each orifice;\\n', 'forcing solids and liquids in at the anus, and making evacuations at the\\n', 'mouth.\\n', '\\n', '“But, besides real diseases, we are subject to many that are only\\n', 'imaginary, for which the physicians have invented imaginary cures; these\\n', 'have their several names, and so have the drugs that are proper for them;\\n', 'and with these our female _Yahoos_ are always infested.\\n', '\\n', '“One great excellency in this tribe, is their skill at prognostics,\\n', 'wherein they seldom fail; their predictions in real diseases, when they\\n', 'rise to any degree of malignity, generally portending death, which is\\n', 'always in their power, when recovery is not: and therefore, upon any\\n', 'unexpected signs of amendment, after they have pronounced their sentence,\\n', 'rather than be accused as false prophets, they know how to approve their\\n', 'sagacity to the world, by a seasonable dose.\\n', '\\n', '“They are likewise of special use to husbands and wives who are grown\\n', 'weary of their mates; to eldest sons, to great ministers of state, and\\n', 'often to princes.”\\n', '\\n', 'I had formerly, upon occasion, discoursed with my master upon the nature\\n', 'of government in general, and particularly of our own excellent\\n', 'constitution, deservedly the wonder and envy of the whole world.  But\\n', 'having here accidentally mentioned a minister of state, he commanded me,\\n', 'some time after, to inform him, “what species of _Yahoo_ I particularly\\n', 'meant by that appellation.”\\n', '\\n', 'I told him, “that a first or chief minister of state, who was the person\\n', 'I intended to describe, was the creature wholly exempt from joy and\\n', 'grief, love and hatred, pity and anger; at least, makes use of no other\\n', 'passions, but a violent desire of wealth, power, and titles; that he\\n', 'applies his words to all uses, except to the indication of his mind; that\\n', 'he never tells a truth but with an intent that you should take it for a\\n', 'lie; nor a lie, but with a design that you should take it for a truth;\\n', 'that those he speaks worst of behind their backs are in the surest way of\\n', 'preferment; and whenever he begins to praise you to others, or to\\n', 'yourself, you are from that day forlorn.  The worst mark you can receive\\n', 'is a promise, especially when it is confirmed with an oath; after which,\\n', 'every wise man retires, and gives over all hopes.\\n', '\\n', '“There are three methods, by which a man may rise to be chief minister.\\n', 'The first is, by knowing how, with prudence, to dispose of a wife, a\\n', 'daughter, or a sister; the second, by betraying or undermining his\\n', 'predecessor; and the third is, by a furious zeal, in public assemblies,\\n', 'against the corruption’s of the court.  But a wise prince would rather\\n', 'choose to employ those who practise the last of these methods; because\\n', 'such zealots prove always the most obsequious and subservient to the will\\n', 'and passions of their master.  That these ministers, having all\\n', 'employments at their disposal, preserve themselves in power, by bribing\\n', 'the majority of a senate or great council; and at last, by an expedient,\\n', 'called an act of indemnity” (whereof I described the nature to him),\\n', '“they secure themselves from after-reckonings, and retire from the public\\n', 'laden with the spoils of the nation.\\n', '\\n', '“The palace of a chief minister is a seminary to breed up others in his\\n', 'own trade: the pages, lackeys, and porters, by imitating their master,\\n', 'become ministers of state in their several districts, and learn to excel\\n', 'in the three principal ingredients, of insolence, lying, and bribery.\\n', 'Accordingly, they have a subaltern court paid to them by persons of the\\n', 'best rank; and sometimes by the force of dexterity and impudence, arrive,\\n', 'through several gradations, to be successors to their lord.\\n', '\\n', '“He is usually governed by a decayed wench, or favourite footman, who are\\n', 'the tunnels through which all graces are conveyed, and may properly be\\n', 'called, in the last resort, the governors of the kingdom.”\\n', '\\n', 'One day, in discourse, my master, having heard me mention the nobility of\\n', 'my country, was pleased to make me a compliment which I could not pretend\\n', 'to deserve: “that he was sure I must have been born of some noble family,\\n', 'because I far exceeded in shape, colour, and cleanliness, all the\\n', '_Yahoos_ of his nation, although I seemed to fail in strength and\\n', 'agility, which must be imputed to my different way of living from those\\n', 'other brutes; and besides I was not only endowed with the faculty of\\n', 'speech, but likewise with some rudiments of reason, to a degree that,\\n', 'with all his acquaintance, I passed for a prodigy.”\\n', '\\n', 'He made me observe, “that among the _Houyhnhnms_, the white, the sorrel,\\n', 'and the iron-gray, were not so exactly shaped as the bay, the\\n', 'dapple-gray, and the black; nor born with equal talents of mind, or a\\n', 'capacity to improve them; and therefore continued always in the condition\\n', 'of servants, without ever aspiring to match out of their own race, which\\n', 'in that country would be reckoned monstrous and unnatural.”\\n', '\\n', 'I made his honour my most humble acknowledgments for the good opinion he\\n', 'was pleased to conceive of me, but assured him at the same time, “that my\\n', 'birth was of the lower sort, having been born of plain honest parents,\\n', 'who were just able to give me a tolerable education; that nobility, among\\n', 'us, was altogether a different thing from the idea he had of it; that our\\n', 'young noblemen are bred from their childhood in idleness and luxury;\\n', 'that, as soon as years will permit, they consume their vigour, and\\n', 'contract odious diseases among lewd females; and when their fortunes are\\n', 'almost ruined, they marry some woman of mean birth, disagreeable person,\\n', 'and unsound constitution (merely for the sake of money), whom they hate\\n', 'and despise.

He said, “he had been very seriously considering my whole\\n', 'story, as far as it related both to myself and my country; that he looked\\n', 'upon us as a sort of animals, to whose share, by what accident he could\\n', 'not conjecture, some small pittance of reason had fallen, whereof we made\\n', 'no other use, than by its assistance, to aggravate our natural\\n', 'corruptions, and to acquire new ones, which nature had not given us; that\\n', 'we disarmed ourselves of the few abilities she had bestowed; had been\\n', 'very successful in multiplying our original wants, and seemed to spend\\n', 'our whole lives in vain endeavours to supply them by our own inventions;\\n', 'that, as to myself, it was manifest I had neither the strength nor\\n', 'agility of a common _Yahoo_; that I walked infirmly on my hinder feet;\\n', 'had found out a contrivance to make my claws of no use or defence, and to\\n', 'remove the hair from my chin, which was intended as a shelter from the\\n', 'sun and the weather: lastly, that I could neither run with speed, nor\\n', 'climb trees like my brethren,” as he called them, “the _Yahoos_ in his\\n', 'country.\\n', '\\n', '“That our institutions of government and law were plainly owing to our\\n', 'gross defects in reason, and by consequence in virtue; because reason\\n', 'alone is sufficient to govern a rational creature; which was, therefore,\\n', 'a character we had no pretence to challenge, even from the account I had\\n', 'given of my own people; although he manifestly perceived, that, in order\\n', 'to favour them, I had concealed many particulars, and often said the\\n', 'thing which was not.\\n', '\\n', '“He was the more confirmed in this opinion, because, he observed, that as\\n', 'I agreed in every feature of my body with other _Yahoos_, except where it\\n', 'was to my real disadvantage in point of strength, speed, and activity,\\n', 'the shortness of my claws, and some other particulars where nature had no\\n', 'part; so from the representation I had given him of our lives, our\\n', 'manners, and our actions, he found as near a resemblance in the\\n', 'disposition of our minds.”  He said, “the _Yahoos_ were known to hate one\\n', 'another, more than they did any different species of animals; and the\\n', 'reason usually assigned was, the odiousness of their own shapes, which\\n', 'all could see in the rest, but not in themselves.  He had therefore begun\\n', 'to think it not unwise in us to cover our bodies, and by that invention\\n', 'conceal many of our deformities from each other, which would else be\\n', 'hardly supportable.  But he now found he had been mistaken, and that the\\n', 'dissensions of those brutes in his country were owing to the same cause\\n', 'with ours, as I had described them.  For if,” said he, “you throw among\\n', 'five _Yahoos_ as much food as would be sufficient for fifty, they will,\\n', 'instead of eating peaceably, fall together by the ears, each single one\\n', 'impatient to have all to itself; and therefore a servant was usually\\n', 'employed to stand by while they were feeding abroad, and those kept at\\n', 'home were tied at a distance from each other: that if a cow died of age\\n', 'or accident, before a _Houyhnhnm_ could secure it for his own _Yahoos_,\\n', 'those in the neighbourhood would come in herds to seize it, and then\\n', 'would ensue such a battle as I had described, with terrible wounds made\\n', 'by their claws on both sides, although they seldom were able to kill one\\n', 'another, for want of such convenient instruments of death as we had\\n', 'invented.  At other times, the like battles have been fought between the\\n', '_Yahoos_ of several neighbourhoods, without any visible cause; those of\\n', 'one district watching all opportunities to surprise the next, before they\\n', 'are prepared.  But if they find their project has miscarried, they return\\n', 'home, and, for want of enemies, engage in what I call a civil war among\\n', 'themselves.\\n', '\\n', '“That in some fields of his country there are certain shining stones of\\n', 'several colours, whereof the _Yahoos_ are violently fond: and when part\\n', 'of these stones is fixed in the earth, as it sometimes happens, they will\\n', 'dig with their claws for whole days to get them out; then carry them\\n', 'away, and hide them by heaps in their kennels; but still looking round\\n', 'with great caution, for fear their comrades should find out their\\n', 'treasure.”  My master said, “he could never discover the reason of this\\n', 'unnatural appetite, or how these stones could be of any use to a _Yahoo_;\\n', 'but now he believed it might proceed from the same principle of avarice\\n', 'which I had ascribed to mankind.  That he had once, by way of experiment,\\n', 'privately removed a heap of these stones from the place where one of his\\n', '_Yahoos_ had buried it; whereupon the sordid animal, missing his\\n', 'treasure, by his loud lamenting brought the whole herd to the place,\\n', 'there miserably howled, then fell to biting and tearing the rest, began\\n', 'to pine away, would neither eat, nor sleep, nor work, till he ordered a\\n', 'servant privately to convey the stones into the same hole, and hide them\\n', 'as before; which, when his _Yahoo_ had found, he presently recovered his\\n', 'spirits and good humour, but took good care to remove them to a better\\n', 'hiding place, and has ever since been a very serviceable brute.”\\n', '\\n', 'My master further assured me, which I also observed myself, “that in the\\n', 'fields where the shining stones abound, the fiercest and most frequent\\n', 'battles are fought, occasioned by perpetual inroads of the neighbouring\\n', '_Yahoos_.”\\n', '\\n', 'He said, “it was common, when two _Yahoos_ discovered such a stone in a\\n', 'field, and were contending which of them should be the proprietor, a\\n', 'third would take the advantage, and carry it away from them both;” which\\n', 'my master would needs contend to have some kind of resemblance with our\\n', 'suits at law; wherein I thought it for our credit not to undeceive him;\\n', 'since the decision he mentioned was much more equitable than many decrees\\n', 'among us; because the plaintiff and defendant there lost nothing beside\\n', 'the stone they contended for: whereas our courts of equity would never\\n', 'have dismissed the cause, while either of them had any thing left.\\n', '\\n', 'My master, continuing his discourse, said, “there was nothing that\\n', 'rendered the _Yahoos_ more odious, than their undistinguishing appetite\\n', 'to devour every thing that came in their way, whether herbs, roots,\\n', 'berries, the corrupted flesh of animals, or all mingled together: and it\\n', 'was peculiar in their temper, that they were fonder of what they could\\n', 'get by rapine or stealth, at a greater distance, than much better food\\n', 'provided for them at home.  If their prey held out, they would eat till\\n', 'they were ready to burst; after which, nature had pointed out to them a\\n', 'certain root that gave them a general evacuation.\\n', '\\n', '“There was also another kind of root, very juicy, but somewhat rare and\\n', 'difficult to be found, which the _Yahoos_ sought for with much eagerness,\\n', 'and would suck it with great delight; it produced in them the same\\n', 'effects that wine has upon us.  It would make them sometimes hug, and\\n', 'sometimes tear one another; they would howl, and grin, and chatter, and\\n', 'reel, and tumble, and then fall asleep in the mud.”\\n', '\\n', 'I did indeed observe that the _Yahoos_ were the only animals in this\\n', 'country subject to any diseases; which, however, were much fewer than\\n', 'horses have among us, and contracted, not by any ill-treatment they meet\\n', 'with, but by the nastiness and greediness of that sordid brute.  Neither\\n', 'has their language any more than a general appellation for those\\n', 'maladies, which is borrowed from the name of the beast, and called\\n', '_hnea-yahoo_, or _Yahoo’s evil_; and the cure prescribed is a mixture of\\n', 'their own dung and urine, forcibly put down the _Yahoo’s_ throat.  This I\\n', 'have since often known to have been taken with success, and do here\\n', 'freely recommend it to my countrymen for the public good, as an admirable\\n', 'specific against all diseases produced by repletion.\\n', '\\n', '“As to learning, government, arts, manufactures, and the like,” my master\\n', 'confessed, “he could find little or no resemblance between the _Yahoos_\\n', 'of that country and those in ours; for he only meant to observe what\\n', 'parity there was in our natures.  He had heard, indeed, some curious\\n', '_Houyhnhnms_ observe, that in most herds there was a sort of ruling\\n', '_Yahoo_ (as among us there is generally some leading or principal stag in\\n', 'a park), who was always more deformed in body, and mischievous in\\n', 'disposition, than any of the rest; that this leader had usually a\\n', 'favourite as like himself as he could get, whose employment was to lick\\n', 'his master’s feet and posteriors, and drive the female _Yahoos_ to his\\n', 'kennel; for which he was now and then rewarded with a piece of ass’s\\n', 'flesh.  This favourite is hated by the whole herd, and therefore, to\\n', 'protect himself, keeps always near the person of his leader.  He usually\\n', 'continues in office till a worse can be found; but the very moment he is\\n', 'discarded, his successor, at the head of all the _Yahoos_ in that\\n', 'district, young and old, male and female, come in a body, and discharge\\n', 'their excrements upon him from head to foot.  But how far this might be\\n', 'applicable to our courts, and favourites, and ministers of state, my\\n', 'master said I could best determine.”\\n', '\\n', 'I durst make no return to this malicious insinuation, which debased human\\n', 'understanding below the sagacity of a common hound, who has judgment\\n', 'enough to distinguish and follow the cry of the ablest dog in the pack,\\n', 'without being ever mistaken.\\n', '\\n', 'My master told me, “there were some qualities remarkable in the _Yahoos_,\\n', 'which he had not observed me to mention, or at least very slightly, in\\n', 'the accounts I had given of humankind.”  He said, “those animals, like\\n', 'other brutes, had their females in common; but in this they differed,\\n', 'that the she _Yahoo_ would admit the males while she was pregnant; and\\n', 'that the hes would quarrel and fight with the females, as fiercely as\\n', 'with each other; both which practices were such degrees of infamous\\n', 'brutality, as no other sensitive creature ever arrived at.\\n', '\\n', '“Another thing he wondered at in the _Yahoos_, was their strange\\n', 'disposition to nastiness and dirt; whereas there appears to be a natural\\n', 'love of cleanliness in all other animals.”  As to the two former\\n', 'accusations, I was glad to let them pass without any reply, because I had\\n', 'not a word to offer upon them in defence of my species, which otherwise I\\n', 'certainly had done from my own inclinations.  But I could have easily\\n', 'vindicated humankind from the imputation of singularity upon the last\\n', 'article, if there had been any swine in that country (as unluckily for me\\n', 'there were not), which, although it may be a sweeter quadruped than a\\n', '_Yahoo_, cannot, I humbly conceive, in justice, pretend to more\\n', 'cleanliness; and so his honour himself must have owned, if he had seen\\n', 'their filthy way of feeding, and their custom of wallowing and sleeping\\n', 'in the mud.\\n', '\\n', 'My master likewise mentioned another quality which his servants had\\n', 'discovered in several Yahoos, and to him was wholly unaccountable.  He\\n', 'said, “a fancy would sometimes take a _Yahoo_ to retire into a corner, to\\n', 'lie down, and howl, and groan, and spurn away all that came near him,\\n', 'although he were young and fat, wanted neither food nor water, nor did\\n', 'the servant imagine what could possibly ail him.  And the only remedy\\n', 'they found was, to set him to hard work, after which he would infallibly\\n', 'come to himself.”  To this I was silent out of partiality to my own kind;\\n', 'yet here I could plainly discover the true seeds of spleen, which only\\n', 'seizes on the lazy, the luxurious, and the rich; who, if they were forced\\n', 'to undergo the same regimen, I would undertake for the cure.\\n', '\\n', 'His honour had further observed, “that a female _Yahoo_ would often stand\\n', 'behind a bank or a bush, to gaze on the young males passing by, and then\\n', 'appear, and hide, using many antic gestures and grimaces, at which time\\n', 'it was observed that she had a most offensive smell; and when any of the\\n', 'males advanced, would slowly retire, looking often back, and with a\\n', 'counterfeit show of fear, run off into some convenient place, where she\\n', 'knew the male would follow her.\\n', '\\n', '“At other times, if a female stranger came among them, three or four of\\n', 'her own sex would get about her, and stare, and chatter, and grin, and\\n', 'smell her all over; and then turn off with gestures, that seemed to\\n', 'express contempt and disdain.”\\n', '\\n', 'Perhaps my master might refine a little in these speculations, which he\\n', 'had drawn from what he observed himself, or had been told him by others;\\n', 'however, I could not reflect without some amazement, and much sorrow,\\n', 'that the rudiments of lewdness, coquetry, censure, and scandal, should\\n', 'have place by instinct in womankind.\\n', '\\n', 'I expected every moment that my master would accuse the _Yahoos_ of those\\n', 'unnatural appetites in both sexes, so common among us.  But nature, it\\n', 'seems, has not been so expert a school-mistress; and these politer\\n', 'pleasures are entirely the productions of art and reason on our side of\\n', 'the globe.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER VIII.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The author relates several particulars of the _Yahoos_.  The great\\n', 'virtues of the _Houyhnhnms_.  The education and exercise of their youth.\\n', 'Their general assembly.\\n', '\\n', 'As I ought to have understood human nature much better than I supposed it\\n', 'possible for my master to do, so it was easy to apply the character he\\n', 'gave of the _Yahoos_ to myself and my countrymen; and I believed I could\\n', 'yet make further discoveries, from my own observation.  I therefore often\\n', 'begged his honour to let me go among the herds of _Yahoos_ in the\\n', 'neighbourhood; to which he always very graciously consented, being\\n', 'perfectly convinced that the hatred I bore these brutes would never\\n', 'suffer me to be corrupted by them; and his honour ordered one of his\\n', 'servants, a strong sorrel nag, very honest and good-natured, to be my\\n', 'guard; without whose protection I durst not undertake such adventures.\\n', 'For I have already told the reader how much I was pestered by these\\n', 'odious animals, upon my first arrival; and I afterwards failed very\\n', 'narrowly, three or four times, of falling into their clutches, when I\\n', 'happened to stray at any distance without my hanger.  And I have reason\\n', 'to believe they had some imagination that I was of their own species,\\n', 'which I often assisted myself by stripping up my sleeves, and showing my\\n', 'naked arms and breasts in their sight, when my protector was with me.  At\\n', 'which times they would approach as near as they durst, and imitate my\\n', 'actions after the manner of monkeys, but ever with great signs of hatred;\\n', 'as a tame jackdaw with cap and stockings is always persecuted by the wild\\n', 'ones, when he happens to be got among them.\\n', '\\n', 'They are prodigiously nimble from their infancy.  However, I once caught\\n', 'a young male of three years old, and endeavoured, by all marks of\\n', 'tenderness, to make it quiet; but the little imp fell a squalling, and\\n', 'scratching, and biting with such violence, that I was forced to let it\\n', 'go; and it was high time, for a whole troop of old ones came about us at\\n', 'the noise, but finding the cub was safe (for away it ran), and my sorrel\\n', 'nag being by, they durst not venture near us.  I observed the young\\n', 'animal’s flesh to smell very rank, and the stink was somewhat between a\\n', 'weasel and a fox, but much more disagreeable.  I forgot another\\n', 'circumstance (and perhaps I might have the reader’s pardon if it were\\n', 'wholly omitted), that while I held the odious vermin in my hands, it\\n', 'voided its filthy excrements of a yellow liquid substance all over my\\n', 'clothes; but by good fortune there was a small brook hard by, where I\\n', 'washed myself as clean as I could; although I durst not come into my\\n', 'master’s presence until I were sufficiently aired.\\n', '\\n', 'By what I could discover, the _Yahoos_ appear to be the most unteachable\\n', 'of all animals: their capacity never reaching higher than to draw or\\n', 'carry burdens.  Yet I am of opinion, this defect arises chiefly from a\\n', 'perverse, restive disposition; for they are cunning, malicious,\\n', 'treacherous, and revengeful.  They are strong and hardy, but of a\\n', 'cowardly spirit, and, by consequence, insolent, abject, and cruel.  It is\\n', 'observed, that the red haired of both sexes are more libidinous and\\n', 'mischievous than the rest, whom yet they much exceed in strength and\\n', 'activity.\\n', '\\n', 'The _Houyhnhnms_ keep the _Yahoos_ for present use in huts not far from\\n', 'the house; but the rest are sent abroad to certain fields, where they dig\\n', 'up roots, eat several kinds of herbs, and search about for carrion, or\\n', 'sometimes catch weasels and _luhimuhs_ (a sort of wild rat), which they\\n', 'greedily devour.  Nature has taught them to dig deep holes with their\\n', 'nails on the side of a rising ground, wherein they lie by themselves;\\n', 'only the kennels of the females are larger, sufficient to hold two or\\n', 'three cubs.\\n', '\\n', 'They swim from their infancy like frogs, and are able to continue long\\n', 'under water, where they often take fish, which the females carry home to\\n', 'their young.  And, upon this occasion, I hope the reader will pardon my\\n', 'relating an odd adventure.\\n', '\\n', 'Being one day abroad with my protector the sorrel nag, and the weather\\n', 'exceeding hot, I entreated him to let me bathe in a river that was near.\\n', 'He consented, and I immediately stripped myself stark naked, and went\\n', 'down softly into the stream.  It happened that a young female _Yahoo_,\\n', 'standing behind a bank, saw the whole proceeding, and inflamed by desire,\\n', 'as the nag and I conjectured, came running with all speed, and leaped\\n', 'into the water, within five yards of the place where I bathed.  I was\\n', 'never in my life so terribly frightened.  The nag was grazing at some\\n', 'distance, not suspecting any harm.  She embraced me after a most fulsome\\n', 'manner.  I roared as loud as I could, and the nag came galloping towards\\n', 'me, whereupon she quitted her grasp, with the utmost reluctancy, and\\n', 'leaped upon the opposite bank, where she stood gazing and howling all the\\n', 'time I was putting on my clothes.\\n', '\\n', 'This was a matter of diversion to my master and his family, as well as of\\n', 'mortification to myself.  For now I could no longer deny that I was a\\n', 'real _Yahoo_ in every limb and feature, since the females had a natural\\n', 'propensity to me, as one of their own species.  Neither was the hair of\\n', 'this brute of a red colour (which might have been some excuse for an\\n', 'appetite a little irregular), but black as a sloe, and her countenance\\n', 'did not make an appearance altogether so hideous as the rest of her kind;\\n', 'for I think she could not be above eleven years old.\\n', '\\n', 'Having lived three years in this country, the reader, I suppose, will\\n', 'expect that I should, like other travellers, give him some account of the\\n', 'manners and customs of its inhabitants, which it was indeed my principal\\n', 'study to learn.\\n', '\\n', 'As these noble _Houyhnhnms_ are endowed by nature with a general\\n', 'disposition to all virtues, and have no conceptions or ideas of what is\\n', 'evil in a rational creature, so their grand maxim is, to cultivate\\n', 'reason, and to be wholly governed by it.  Neither is reason among them a\\n', 'point problematical, as with us, where men can argue with plausibility on\\n', 'both sides of the question, but strikes you with immediate conviction; as\\n', 'it must needs do, where it is not mingled, obscured, or discoloured, by\\n', 'passion and interest.  I remember it was with extreme difficulty that I\\n', 'could bring my master to understand the meaning of the word opinion, or\\n', 'how a point could be disputable; because reason taught us to affirm or\\n', 'deny only where we are certain; and beyond our knowledge we cannot do\\n', 'either.  So that controversies, wranglings, disputes, and positiveness,\\n', 'in false or dubious propositions, are evils unknown among the\\n', '_Houyhnhnms_.  In the like manner, when I used to explain to him our\\n', 'several systems of natural philosophy, he would laugh, “that a creature\\n', 'pretending to reason, should value itself upon the knowledge of other\\n', 'people’s conjectures, and in things where that knowledge, if it were\\n', 'certain, could be of no use.”  Wherein he agreed entirely with the\\n', 'sentiments of Socrates, as Plato delivers them; which I mention as the\\n', 'highest honour I can do that prince of philosophers.  I have often since\\n', 'reflected, what destruction such doctrine would make in the libraries of\\n', 'Europe; and how many paths of fame would be then shut up in the learned\\n', 'world.\\n', '\\n', 'Friendship and benevolence are the two principal virtues among the\\n', '_Houyhnhnms_; and these not confined to particular objects, but universal\\n', 'to the whole race; for a stranger from the remotest part is equally\\n', 'treated with the nearest neighbour, and wherever he goes, looks upon\\n', 'himself as at home.  They preserve decency and civility in the highest\\n', 'degrees, but are altogether ignorant of ceremony.  They have no fondness\\n', 'for their colts or foals, but the care they take in educating them\\n', 'proceeds entirely from the dictates of reason.  And I observed my master\\n', 'to show the same affection to his neighbour’s issue, that he had for his\\n', 'own.  They will have it that nature teaches them to love the whole\\n', 'species, and it is reason only that makes a distinction of persons, where\\n', 'there is a superior degree of virtue.\\n', '\\n', 'When the matron _Houyhnhnms_ have produced one of each sex, they no\\n', 'longer accompany with their consorts, except they lose one of their issue\\n', 'by some casualty, which very seldom happens; but in such a case they meet\\n', 'again; or when the like accident befalls a person whose wife is past\\n', 'bearing, some other couple bestow on him one of their own colts, and then\\n', 'go together again until the mother is pregnant.  This caution is\\n', 'necessary, to prevent the country from being overburdened with numbers.\\n', 'But the race of inferior _Houyhnhnms_, bred up to be servants, is not so\\n', 'strictly limited upon this article: these are allowed to produce three of\\n', 'each sex, to be domestics in the noble families.\\n', '\\n', 'In their marriages, they are exactly careful to choose such colours as\\n', 'will not make any disagreeable mixture in the breed.  Strength is chiefly\\n', 'valued in the male, and comeliness in the female; not upon the account of\\n', 'love, but to preserve the race from degenerating; for where a female\\n', 'happens to excel in strength, a consort is chosen, with regard to\\n', 'comeliness.\\n', '\\n', 'Courtship, love, presents, jointures, settlements have no place in their\\n', 'thoughts, or terms whereby to express them in their language.  The young\\n', 'couple meet, and are joined, merely because it is the determination of\\n', 'their parents and friends; it is what they see done every day, and they\\n', 'look upon it as one of the necessary actions of a reasonable being.  But\\n', 'the violation of marriage, or any other unchastity, was never heard of;\\n', 'and the married pair pass their lives with the same friendship and mutual\\n', 'benevolence, that they bear to all others of the same species who come in\\n', 'their way, without jealousy, fondness, quarrelling, or discontent.\\n', '\\n', 'In educating the youth of both sexes, their method is admirable, and\\n', 'highly deserves our imitation.  These are not suffered to taste a grain\\n', 'of oats, except upon certain days, till eighteen years old; nor milk, but\\n', 'very rarely; and in summer they graze two hours in the morning, and as\\n', 'many in the evening, which their parents likewise observe; but the\\n', 'servants are not allowed above half that time, and a great part of their\\n', 'grass is brought home, which they eat at the most convenient hours, when\\n', 'they can be best spared from work.\\n', '\\n', 'Temperance, industry, exercise, and cleanliness, are the lessons equally\\n', 'enjoined to the young ones of both sexes: and my master thought it\\n', 'monstrous in us, to give the females a different kind of education from\\n', 'the males, except in some articles of domestic management; whereby, as he\\n', 'truly observed, one half of our natives were good for nothing but\\n', 'bringing children into the world; and to trust the care of our children\\n', 'to such useless animals, he said, was yet a greater instance of\\n', 'brutality.\\n', '\\n', 'But the _Houyhnhnms_ train up their youth to strength, speed, and\\n', 'hardiness, by exercising them in running races up and down steep hills,\\n', 'and over hard stony grounds; and when they are all in a sweat, they are\\n', 'ordered to leap over head and ears into a pond or river.  Four times a\\n', 'year the youth of a certain district meet to show their proficiency in\\n', 'running and leaping, and other feats of strength and agility; where the\\n', 'victor is rewarded with a song in his or her praise.  On this festival,\\n', 'the servants drive a herd of _Yahoos_ into the field, laden with hay, and\\n', 'oats, and milk, for a repast to the _Houyhnhnms_; after which, these\\n', 'brutes are immediately driven back again, for fear of being noisome to\\n', 'the assembly.\\n', '\\n', 'Every fourth year, at the vernal equinox, there is a representative\\n', 'council of the whole nation, which meets in a plain about twenty miles\\n', 'from our house, and continues about five or six days.  Here they inquire\\n', 'into the state and condition of the several districts; whether they\\n', 'abound or be deficient in hay or oats, or cows, or _Yahoos_; and wherever\\n', 'there is any want (which is but seldom) it is immediately supplied by\\n', 'unanimous consent and contribution.  Here likewise the regulation of\\n', 'children is settled: as for instance, if a _Houyhnhnm_ has two males, he\\n', 'changes one of them with another that has two females; and when a child\\n', 'has been lost by any casualty, where the mother is past breeding, it is\\n', 'determined what family in the district shall breed another to supply the\\n', 'loss.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER IX.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'A grand debate at the general assembly of the _Houyhnhnms_, and how it\\n', 'was determined.  The learning of the _Houyhnhnms_.  Their buildings.\\n', 'Their manner of burials.  The defectiveness of their language.\\n', '\\n', 'One of these grand assemblies was held in my time, about three months\\n', 'before my departure, whither my master went as the representative of our\\n', 'district.  In this council was resumed their old debate, and indeed the\\n', 'only debate that ever happened in their country; whereof my master, after\\n', 'his return, give me a very particular account.\\n', '\\n', 'The question to be debated was, “whether the _Yahoos_ should be\\n', 'exterminated from the face of the earth?”  One of the members for the\\n', 'affirmative offered several arguments of great strength and weight,\\n', 'alleging, “that as the _Yahoos_ were the most filthy, noisome, and\\n', 'deformed animals which nature ever produced, so they were the most\\n', 'restive and indocible, mischievous and malicious; they would privately\\n', 'suck the teats of the _Houyhnhnms’_ cows, kill and devour their cats,\\n', 'trample down their oats and grass, if they were not continually watched,\\n', 'and commit a thousand other extravagancies.”  He took notice of a general\\n', 'tradition, “that _Yahoos_ had not been always in their country; but that\\n', 'many ages ago, two of these brutes appeared together upon a mountain;\\n', 'whether produced by the heat of the sun upon corrupted mud and slime, or\\n', 'from the ooze and froth of the sea, was never known; that these _Yahoos_\\n', 'engendered, and their brood, in a short time, grew so numerous as to\\n', 'overrun and infest the whole nation; that the _Houyhnhnms_, to get rid of\\n', 'this evil, made a general hunting, and at last enclosed the whole herd;\\n', 'and destroying the elder, every _Houyhnhnm_ kept two young ones in a\\n', 'kennel, and brought them to such a degree of tameness, as an animal, so\\n', 'savage by nature, can be capable of acquiring, using them for draught and\\n', 'carriage; that there seemed to be much truth in this tradition, and that\\n', 'those creatures could not be _yinhniamshy_ (or _aborigines_ of the land),\\n', 'because of the violent hatred the _Houyhnhnms_, as well as all other\\n', 'animals, bore them, which, although their evil disposition sufficiently\\n', 'deserved, could never have arrived at so high a degree if they had been\\n', '_aborigines_, or else they would have long since been rooted out; that\\n', 'the inhabitants, taking a fancy to use the service of the _Yahoos_, had,\\n', 'very imprudently, neglected to cultivate the breed of asses, which are a\\n', 'comely animal, easily kept, more tame and orderly, without any offensive\\n', 'smell, strong enough for labour, although they yield to the other in\\n', 'agility of body, and if their braying be no agreeable sound, it is far\\n', 'preferable to the horrible howlings of the _Yahoos_.”\\n', '\\n', 'Several others declared their sentiments to the same purpose, when my\\n', 'master proposed an expedient to the assembly, whereof he had indeed\\n', 'borrowed the hint from me.  “He approved of the tradition mentioned by\\n', 'the honourable member who spoke before, and affirmed, that the two\\n', '_Yahoos_ said to be seen first among them, had been driven thither over\\n', 'the sea; that coming to land, and being forsaken by their companions,\\n', 'they retired to the mountains, and degenerating by degrees, became in\\n', 'process of time much more savage than those of their own species in the\\n', 'country whence these two originals came.  The reason of this assertion\\n', 'was, that he had now in his possession a certain wonderful _Yahoo_\\n', '(meaning myself) which most of them had heard of, and many of them had\\n', 'seen.  He then related to them how he first found me; that my body was\\n', 'all covered with an artificial composure of the skins and hairs of other\\n', 'animals; that I spoke in a language of my own, and had thoroughly learned\\n', 'theirs; that I had related to him the accidents which brought me thither;\\n', 'that when he saw me without my covering, I was an exact _Yahoo_ in every\\n', 'part, only of a whiter colour, less hairy, and with shorter claws.  He\\n', 'added, how I had endeavoured to persuade him, that in my own and other\\n', 'countries, the _Yahoos_ acted as the governing, rational animal, and held\\n', 'the _Houyhnhnms_ in servitude; that he observed in me all the qualities\\n', 'of a _Yahoo_, only a little more civilized by some tincture of reason,\\n', 'which, however, was in a degree as far inferior to the _Houyhnhnm_ race,\\n', 'as the _Yahoos_ of their country were to me; that, among other things, I\\n', 'mentioned a custom we had of castrating _Houyhnhnms_ when they were\\n', 'young, in order to render them tame; that the operation was easy and\\n', 'safe; that it was no shame to learn wisdom from brutes, as industry is\\n', 'taught by the ant, and building by the swallow (for so I translate the\\n', 'word _lyhannh_, although it be a much larger fowl); that this invention\\n', 'might be practised upon the younger _Yahoos_ here, which besides\\n', 'rendering them tractable and fitter for use, would in an age put an end\\n', 'to the whole species, without destroying life; that in the mean time the\\n', '_Houyhnhnms_ should be exhorted to cultivate the breed of asses, which,\\n', 'as they are in all respects more valuable brutes, so they have this\\n', 'advantage, to be fit for service at five years old, which the others are\\n', 'not till twelve.”\\n', '\\n', 'This was all my master thought fit to tell me, at that time, of what\\n', 'passed in the grand council.  But he was pleased to conceal one\\n', 'particular, which related personally to myself, whereof I soon felt the\\n', 'unhappy effect, as the reader will know in its proper place, and whence I\\n', 'date all the succeeding misfortunes of my life.\\n', '\\n', 'The _Houyhnhnms_ have no letters, and consequently their knowledge is all\\n', 'traditional.  But there happening few events of any moment among a people\\n', 'so well united, naturally disposed to every virtue, wholly governed by\\n', 'reason, and cut off from all commerce with other nations, the historical\\n', 'part is easily preserved without burdening their memories.  I have\\n', 'already observed that they are subject to no diseases, and therefore can\\n', 'have no need of physicians.  However, they have excellent medicines,\\n', 'composed of herbs, to cure accidental bruises and cuts in the pastern or\\n', 'frog of the foot, by sharp stones, as well as other maims and hurts in\\n', 'the several parts of the body.\\n', '\\n', 'They calculate the year by the revolution of the sun and moon, but use no\\n', 'subdivisions into weeks.  They are well enough acquainted with the\\n', 'motions of those two luminaries, and understand the nature of eclipses;\\n', 'and this is the utmost progress of their astronomy.\\n', '\\n', 'In poetry, they must be allowed to excel all other mortals; wherein the\\n', 'justness of their similes, and the minuteness as well as exactness of\\n', 'their descriptions, are indeed inimitable.  Their verses abound very much\\n', 'in both of these, and usually contain either some exalted notions of\\n', 'friendship and benevolence or the praises of those who were victors in\\n', 'races and other bodily exercises.  Their buildings, although very rude\\n', 'and simple, are not inconvenient, but well contrived to defend them from\\n', 'all injuries of cold and heat.  They have a kind of tree, which at forty\\n', 'years old loosens in the root, and falls with the first storm: it grows\\n', 'very straight, and being pointed like stakes with a sharp stone (for the\\n', '_Houyhnhnms_ know not the use of iron), they stick them erect in the\\n', 'ground, about ten inches asunder, and then weave in oat straw, or\\n', 'sometimes wattles, between them.  The roof is made after the same manner,\\n', 'and so are the doors.\\n', '\\n', 'The _Houyhnhnms_ use the hollow part, between the pastern and the hoof of\\n', 'their fore-foot, as we do our hands, and this with greater dexterity than\\n', 'I could at first imagine.  I have seen a white mare of our family thread\\n', 'a needle (which I lent her on purpose) with that joint.  They milk their\\n', 'cows, reap their oats, and do all the work which requires hands, in the\\n', 'same manner.  They have a kind of hard flints, which, by grinding against\\n', 'other stones, they form into instruments, that serve instead of wedges,\\n', 'axes, and hammers.  With tools made of these flints, they likewise cut\\n', 'their hay, and reap their oats, which there grow naturally in several\\n', 'fields; the _Yahoos_ draw home the sheaves in carriages, and the servants\\n', 'tread them in certain covered huts to get out the grain, which is kept in\\n', 'stores.  They make a rude kind of earthen and wooden vessels, and bake\\n', 'the former in the sun.\\n', '\\n', 'If they can avoid casualties, they die only of old age, and are buried in\\n', 'the obscurest places that can be found, their friends and relations\\n', 'expressing neither joy nor grief at their departure; nor does the dying\\n', 'person discover the least regret that he is leaving the world, any more\\n', 'than if he were upon returning home from a visit to one of his\\n', 'neighbours.  I remember my master having once made an appointment with a\\n', 'friend and his family to come to his house, upon some affair of\\n', 'importance: on the day fixed, the mistress and her two children came very\\n', 'late; she made two excuses, first for her husband, who, as she said,\\n', 'happened that very morning to _shnuwnh_.  The word is strongly expressive\\n', 'in their language, but not easily rendered into English; it signifies,\\n', '“to retire to his first mother.”  Her excuse for not coming sooner, was,\\n', 'that her husband dying late in the morning, she was a good while\\n', 'consulting her servants about a convenient place where his body should be\\n', 'laid; and I observed, she behaved herself at our house as cheerfully as\\n', 'the rest.  She died about three months after.\\n', '\\n', 'They live generally to seventy, or seventy-five years, very seldom to\\n', 'fourscore.  Some weeks before their death, they feel a gradual decay; but\\n', 'without pain.  During this time they are much visited by their friends,\\n', 'because they cannot go abroad with their usual ease and satisfaction.\\n', 'However, about ten days before their death, which they seldom fail in\\n', 'computing, they return the visits that have been made them by those who\\n', 'are nearest in the neighbourhood, being carried in a convenient sledge\\n', 'drawn by _Yahoos_; which vehicle they use, not only upon this occasion,\\n', 'but when they grow old, upon long journeys, or when they are lamed by any\\n', 'accident: and therefore when the dying _Houyhnhnms_ return those visits,\\n', 'they take a solemn leave of their friends, as if they were going to some\\n', 'remote part of the country, where they designed to pass the rest of their\\n', 'lives.\\n', '\\n', 'I know not whether it may be worth observing, that the _Houyhnhnms_ have\\n', 'no word in their language to express any thing that is evil, except what\\n', 'they borrow from the deformities or ill qualities of the _Yahoos_.  Thus\\n', 'they denote the folly of a servant, an omission of a child, a stone that\\n', 'cuts their feet, a continuance of foul or unseasonable weather, and the\\n', 'like, by adding to each the epithet of _Yahoo_.

My master had\\n', 'ordered a room to be made for me, after their manner, about six yards\\n', 'from the house: the sides and floors of which I plastered with clay, and\\n', 'covered with rush-mats of my own contriving.  I had beaten hemp, which\\n', 'there grows wild, and made of it a sort of ticking; this I filled with\\n', 'the feathers of several birds I had taken with springes made of _Yahoos’_\\n', 'hairs, and were excellent food.  I had worked two chairs with my knife,\\n', 'the sorrel nag helping me in the grosser and more laborious part.  When\\n', 'my clothes were worn to rags, I made myself others with the skins of\\n', 'rabbits, and of a certain beautiful animal, about the same size, called\\n', '_nnuhnoh_, the skin of which is covered with a fine down.  Of these I\\n', 'also made very tolerable stockings.  I soled my shoes with wood, which I\\n', 'cut from a tree, and fitted to the upper-leather; and when this was worn\\n', 'out, I supplied it with the skins of _Yahoos_ dried in the sun.  I often\\n', 'got honey out of hollow trees, which I mingled with water, or ate with my\\n', 'bread.  No man could more verify the truth of these two maxims, “That\\n', 'nature is very easily satisfied;” and, “That necessity is the mother of\\n', 'invention.”  I enjoyed perfect health of body, and tranquillity of mind;\\n', 'I did not feel the treachery or inconstancy of a friend, nor the injuries\\n', 'of a secret or open enemy.  I had no occasion of bribing, flattering, or\\n', 'pimping, to procure the favour of any great man, or of his minion; I\\n', 'wanted no fence against fraud or oppression: here was neither physician\\n', 'to destroy my body, nor lawyer to ruin my fortune; no informer to watch\\n', 'my words and actions, or forge accusations against me for hire: here were\\n', 'no gibers, censurers, backbiters, pickpockets, highwaymen, housebreakers,\\n', 'attorneys, bawds, buffoons, gamesters, politicians, wits, splenetics,\\n', 'tedious talkers, controvertists, ravishers, murderers, robbers,\\n', 'virtuosos; no leaders, or followers, of party and faction; no encouragers\\n', 'to vice, by seducement or examples; no dungeon, axes, gibbets,\\n', 'whipping-posts, or pillories; no cheating shopkeepers or mechanics; no\\n', 'pride, vanity, or affectation; no fops, bullies, drunkards, strolling\\n', 'whores, or poxes; no ranting, lewd, expensive wives; no stupid, proud\\n', 'pedants; no importunate, overbearing, quarrelsome, noisy, roaring, empty,\\n', 'conceited, swearing companions; no scoundrels raised from the dust upon\\n', 'the merit of their vices, or nobility thrown into it on account of their\\n', 'virtues; no lords, fiddlers, judges, or dancing-masters.\\n', '\\n', 'I had the favour of being admitted to several _Houyhnhnms_, who came to\\n', 'visit or dine with my master; where his honour graciously suffered me to\\n', 'wait in the room, and listen to their discourse.  Both he and his company\\n', 'would often descend to ask me questions, and receive my answers.  I had\\n', 'also sometimes the honour of attending my master in his visits to others.\\n', 'I never presumed to speak, except in answer to a question; and then I did\\n', 'it with inward regret, because it was a loss of so much time for\\n', 'improving myself; but I was infinitely delighted with the station of an\\n', 'humble auditor in such conversations, where nothing passed but what was\\n', 'useful, expressed in the fewest and most significant words; where, as I\\n', 'have already said, the greatest decency was observed, without the least\\n', 'degree of ceremony; where no person spoke without being pleased himself,\\n', 'and pleasing his companions; where there was no interruption,\\n', 'tediousness, heat, or difference of sentiments.  They have a notion, that\\n', 'when people are met together, a short silence does much improve\\n', 'conversation: this I found to be true; for during those little\\n', 'intermissions of talk, new ideas would arise in their minds, which very\\n', 'much enlivened the discourse.  Their subjects are, generally on\\n', 'friendship and benevolence, on order and economy; sometimes upon the\\n', 'visible operations of nature, or ancient traditions; upon the bounds and\\n', 'limits of virtue; upon the unerring rules of reason, or upon some\\n', 'determinations to be taken at the next great assembly: and often upon the\\n', 'various excellences of poetry.  I may add, without vanity, that my\\n', 'presence often gave them sufficient matter for discourse, because it\\n', 'afforded my master an occasion of letting his friends into the history of\\n', 'me and my country, upon which they were all pleased to descant, in a\\n', 'manner not very advantageous to humankind: and for that reason I shall\\n', 'not repeat what they said; only I may be allowed to observe, that his\\n', 'honour, to my great admiration, appeared to understand the nature of\\n', '_Yahoos_ much better than myself.  He went through all our vices and\\n', 'follies, and discovered many, which I had never mentioned to him, by only\\n', 'supposing what qualities a _Yahoo_ of their country, with a small\\n', 'proportion of reason, might be capable of exerting; and concluded, with\\n', 'too much probability, “how vile, as well as miserable, such a creature\\n', 'must be.”\\n', '\\n', 'I freely confess, that all the little knowledge I have of any value, was\\n', 'acquired by the lectures I received from my master, and from hearing the\\n', 'discourses of him and his friends; to which I should be prouder to\\n', 'listen, than to dictate to the greatest and wisest assembly in Europe.  I\\n', 'admired the strength, comeliness, and speed of the inhabitants; and such\\n', 'a constellation of virtues, in such amiable persons, produced in me the\\n', 'highest veneration.  At first, indeed, I did not feel that natural awe,\\n', 'which the _Yahoos_ and all other animals bear toward them; but it grew\\n', 'upon me by decrees, much sooner than I imagined, and was mingled with a\\n', 'respectful love and gratitude, that they would condescend to distinguish\\n', 'me from the rest of my species.\\n', '\\n', 'When I thought of my family, my friends, my countrymen, or the human race\\n', 'in general, I considered them, as they really were, _Yahoos_ in shape and\\n', 'disposition, perhaps a little more civilized, and qualified with the gift\\n', 'of speech; but making no other use of reason, than to improve and\\n', 'multiply those vices whereof their brethren in this country had only the\\n', 'share that nature allotted them.  When I happened to behold the\\n', 'reflection of my own form in a lake or fountain, I turned away my face in\\n', 'horror and detestation of myself, and could better endure the sight of a\\n', 'common _Yahoo_ than of my own person.  By conversing with the\\n', '_Houyhnhnms_, and looking upon them with delight, I fell to imitate their\\n', 'gait and gesture, which is now grown into a habit; and my friends often\\n', 'tell me, in a blunt way, “that I trot like a horse;” which, however, I\\n', 'take for a great compliment.  Neither shall I disown, that in speaking I\\n', 'am apt to fall into the voice and manner of the _Houyhnhnms_, and hear\\n', 'myself ridiculed on that account, without the least mortification.\\n', '\\n', 'In the midst of all this happiness, and when I looked upon myself to be\\n', 'fully settled for life, my master sent for me one morning a little\\n', 'earlier than his usual hour.  I observed by his countenance that he was\\n', 'in some perplexity, and at a loss how to begin what he had to speak.\\n', 'After a short silence, he told me, “he did not know how I would take what\\n', 'he was going to say: that in the last general assembly, when the affair\\n', 'of the _Yahoos_ was entered upon, the representatives had taken offence\\n', 'at his keeping a _Yahoo_ (meaning myself) in his family, more like a\\n', '_Houyhnhnm_ than a brute animal; that he was known frequently to converse\\n', 'with me, as if he could receive some advantage or pleasure in my company;\\n', 'that such a practice was not agreeable to reason or nature, or a thing\\n', 'ever heard of before among them; the assembly did therefore exhort him\\n', 'either to employ me like the rest of my species, or command me to swim\\n', 'back to the place whence I came: that the first of these expedients was\\n', 'utterly rejected by all the _Houyhnhnms_ who had ever seen me at his\\n', 'house or their own; for they alleged, that because I had some rudiments\\n', 'of reason, added to the natural pravity of those animals, it was to be\\n', 'feared I might be able to seduce them into the woody and mountainous\\n', 'parts of the country, and bring them in troops by night to destroy the\\n', '_Houyhnhnms’_ cattle, as being naturally of the ravenous kind, and averse\\n', 'from labour.”\\n', '\\n', 'My master added, “that he was daily pressed by the _Houyhnhnms_ of the\\n', 'neighbourhood to have the assembly’s exhortation executed, which he could\\n', 'not put off much longer.  He doubted it would be impossible for me to\\n', 'swim to another country; and therefore wished I would contrive some sort\\n', 'of vehicle, resembling those I had described to him, that might carry me\\n', 'on the sea; in which work I should have the assistance of his own\\n', 'servants, as well as those of his neighbours.”  He concluded, “that for\\n', 'his own part, he could have been content to keep me in his service as\\n', 'long as I lived; because he found I had cured myself of some bad habits\\n', 'and dispositions, by endeavouring, as far as my inferior nature was\\n', 'capable, to imitate the _Houyhnhnms_.”\\n', '\\n', 'I should here observe to the reader, that a decree of the general\\n', 'assembly in this country is expressed by the word _hnhloayn_, which\\n', 'signifies an exhortation, as near as I can render it; for they have no\\n', 'conception how a rational creature can be compelled, but only advised, or\\n', 'exhorted; because no person can disobey reason, without giving up his\\n', 'claim to be a rational creature.\\n', '\\n', 'I was struck with the utmost grief and despair at my master’s discourse;\\n', 'and being unable to support the agonies I was under, I fell into a swoon\\n', 'at his feet.  When I came to myself, he told me “that he concluded I had\\n', 'been dead;” for these people are subject to no such imbecilities of\\n', 'nature.  I answered in a faint voice, “that death would have been too\\n', 'great a happiness; that although I could not blame the assembly’s\\n', 'exhortation, or the urgency of his friends; yet, in my weak and corrupt\\n', 'judgment, I thought it might consist with reason to have been less\\n', 'rigorous; that I could not swim a league, and probably the nearest land\\n', 'to theirs might be distant above a hundred: that many materials,\\n', 'necessary for making a small vessel to carry me off, were wholly wanting\\n', 'in this country; which, however, I would attempt, in obedience and\\n', 'gratitude to his honour, although I concluded the thing to be impossible,\\n', 'and therefore looked on myself as already devoted to destruction; that\\n', 'the certain prospect of an unnatural death was the least of my evils;\\n', 'for, supposing I should escape with life by some strange adventure, how\\n', 'could I think with temper of passing my days among _Yahoos_, and\\n', 'relapsing into my old corruptions, for want of examples to lead and keep\\n', 'me within the paths of virtue? that I knew too well upon what solid\\n', 'reasons all the determinations of the wise _Houyhnhnms_ were founded, not\\n', 'to be shaken by arguments of mine, a miserable _Yahoo_; and therefore,\\n', 'after presenting him with my humble thanks for the offer of his servants’\\n', 'assistance in making a vessel, and desiring a reasonable time for so\\n', 'difficult a work, I told him I would endeavour to preserve a wretched\\n', 'being; and if ever I returned to England, was not without hopes of being\\n', 'useful to my own species, by celebrating the praises of the renowned\\n', '_Houyhnhnms_, and proposing their virtues to the imitation of mankind.”\\n', '\\n', 'My master, in a few words, made me a very gracious reply; allowed me the\\n', 'space of two months to finish my boat; and ordered the sorrel nag, my\\n', 'fellow-servant (for so, at this distance, I may presume to call him), to\\n', 'follow my instruction; because I told my master, “that his help would be\\n', 'sufficient, and I knew he had a tenderness for me.”\\n', '\\n', 'In his company, my first business was to go to that part of the coast\\n', 'where my rebellious crew had ordered me to be set on shore.  I got upon a\\n', 'height, and looking on every side into the sea; fancied I saw a small\\n', 'island toward the north-east.  I took out my pocket glass, and could then\\n', 'clearly distinguish it above five leagues off, as I computed; but it\\n', 'appeared to the sorrel nag to be only a blue cloud: for as he had no\\n', 'conception of any country beside his own, so he could not be as expert in\\n', 'distinguishing remote objects at sea, as we who so much converse in that\\n', 'element.\\n', '\\n', 'After I had discovered this island, I considered no further; but resolved\\n', 'it should if possible, be the first place of my banishment, leaving the\\n', 'consequence to fortune.\\n', '\\n', 'I returned home, and consulting with the sorrel nag, we went into a copse\\n', 'at some distance, where I with my knife, and he with a sharp flint,\\n', 'fastened very artificially after their manner, to a wooden handle, cut\\n', 'down several oak wattles, about the thickness of a walking-staff, and\\n', 'some larger pieces.  But I shall not trouble the reader with a particular\\n', 'description of my own mechanics; let it suffice to say, that in six weeks\\n', 'time with the help of the sorrel nag, who performed the parts that\\n', 'required most labour, I finished a sort of Indian canoe, but much larger,\\n', 'covering it with the skins of _Yahoos_, well stitched together with\\n', 'hempen threads of my own making.  My sail was likewise composed of the\\n', 'skins of the same animal; but I made use of the youngest I could get, the\\n', 'older being too tough and thick; and I likewise provided myself with four\\n', 'paddles.  I laid in a stock of boiled flesh, of rabbits and fowls, and\\n', 'took with me two vessels, one filled with milk and the other with water.\\n', '\\n', 'I tried my canoe in a large pond, near my master’s house, and then\\n', 'corrected in it what was amiss; stopping all the chinks with _Yahoos’_\\n', 'tallow, till I found it staunch, and able to bear me and my freight; and,\\n', 'when it was as complete as I could possibly make it, I had it drawn on a\\n', 'carriage very gently by _Yahoos_ to the sea-side, under the conduct of\\n', 'the sorrel nag and another servant.\\n', '\\n', 'When all was ready, and the day came for my departure, I took leave of my\\n', 'master and lady and the whole family, my eyes flowing with tears, and my\\n', 'heart quite sunk with grief.  But his honour, out of curiosity, and,\\n', 'perhaps, (if I may speak without vanity,) partly out of kindness, was\\n', 'determined to see me in my canoe, and got several of his neighbouring\\n', 'friends to accompany him.  I was forced to wait above an hour for the\\n', 'tide; and then observing the wind very fortunately bearing toward the\\n', 'island to which I intended to steer my course, I took a second leave of\\n', 'my master: but as I was going to prostrate myself to kiss his hoof, he\\n', 'did me the honour to raise it gently to my mouth.  I am not ignorant how\\n', 'much I have been censured for mentioning this last particular.\\n', 'Detractors are pleased to think it improbable, that so illustrious a\\n', 'person should descend to give so great a mark of distinction to a\\n', 'creature so inferior as I.

My master and his friends continued on\\n', 'the shore till I was almost out of sight; and I often heard the sorrel\\n', 'nag (who always loved me) crying out, “_Hnuy illa nyha_, _majah Yahoo_;”\\n', '“Take care of thyself, gentle _Yahoo_.”\\n', '\\n', 'My design was, if possible, to discover some small island uninhabited,\\n', 'yet sufficient, by my labour, to furnish me with the necessaries of life,\\n', 'which I would have thought a greater happiness, than to be first minister\\n', 'in the politest court of Europe; so horrible was the idea I conceived of\\n', 'returning to live in the society, and under the government of _Yahoos_.\\n', 'For in such a solitude as I desired, I could at least enjoy my own\\n', 'thoughts, and reflect with delight on the virtues of those inimitable\\n', '_Houyhnhnms_, without an opportunity of degenerating into the vices and\\n', 'corruptions of my own species.\\n', '\\n', 'The reader may remember what I related, when my crew conspired against\\n', 'me, and confined me to my cabin; how I continued there several weeks\\n', 'without knowing what course we took; and when I was put ashore in the\\n', 'long-boat, how the sailors told me, with oaths, whether true or false,\\n', '“that they knew not in what part of the world we were.”  However, I did\\n', 'then believe us to be about 10 degrees southward of the Cape of Good\\n', 'Hope, or about 45 degrees southern latitude, as I gathered from some\\n', 'general words I overheard among them, being I supposed to the south-east\\n', 'in their intended voyage to Madagascar.  And although this were little\\n', 'better than conjecture, yet I resolved to steer my course eastward,\\n', 'hoping to reach the south-west coast of New Holland, and perhaps some\\n', 'such island as I desired lying westward of it.  The wind was full west,\\n', 'and by six in the evening I computed I had gone eastward at least\\n', 'eighteen leagues; when I spied a very small island about half a league\\n', 'off, which I soon reached.  It was nothing but a rock, with one creek\\n', 'naturally arched by the force of tempests.  Here I put in my canoe, and\\n', 'climbing a part of the rock, I could plainly discover land to the east,\\n', 'extending from south to north.  I lay all night in my canoe; and\\n', 'repeating my voyage early in the morning, I arrived in seven hours to the\\n', 'south-east point of New Holland.  This confirmed me in the opinion I have\\n', 'long entertained, that the maps and charts place this country at least\\n', 'three degrees more to the east than it really is; which thought I\\n', 'communicated many years ago to my worthy friend, Mr. Herman Moll, and\\n', 'gave him my reasons for it, although he has rather chosen to follow other\\n', 'authors.\\n', '\\n', 'I saw no inhabitants in the place where I landed, and being unarmed, I\\n', 'was afraid of venturing far into the country.  I found some shellfish on\\n', 'the shore, and ate them raw, not daring to kindle a fire, for fear of\\n', 'being discovered by the natives.  I continued three days feeding on\\n', 'oysters and limpets, to save my own provisions; and I fortunately found a\\n', 'brook of excellent water, which gave me great relief.\\n', '\\n', 'On the fourth day, venturing out early a little too far, I saw twenty or\\n', 'thirty natives upon a height not above five hundred yards from me.  They\\n', 'were stark naked, men, women, and children, round a fire, as I could\\n', 'discover by the smoke.  One of them spied me, and gave notice to the\\n', 'rest; five of them advanced toward me, leaving the women and children at\\n', 'the fire.  I made what haste I could to the shore, and, getting into my\\n', 'canoe, shoved off: the savages, observing me retreat, ran after me: and\\n', 'before I could get far enough into the sea, discharged an arrow which\\n', 'wounded me deeply on the inside of my left knee: I shall carry the mark\\n', 'to my grave.  I apprehended the arrow might be poisoned, and paddling out\\n', 'of the reach of their darts (being a calm day), I made a shift to suck\\n', 'the wound, and dress it as well as I could.\\n', '\\n', 'I was at a loss what to do, for I durst not return to the same\\n', 'landing-place, but stood to the north, and was forced to paddle, for the\\n', 'wind, though very gentle, was against me, blowing north-west.  As I was\\n', 'looking about for a secure landing-place, I saw a sail to the\\n', 'north-north-east, which appearing every minute more visible, I was in\\n', 'some doubt whether I should wait for them or not; but at last my\\n', 'detestation of the _Yahoo_ race prevailed: and turning my canoe, I sailed\\n', 'and paddled together to the south, and got into the same creek whence I\\n', 'set out in the morning, choosing rather to trust myself among these\\n', 'barbarians, than live with European _Yahoos_.  I drew up my canoe as\\n', 'close as I could to the shore, and hid myself behind a stone by the\\n', 'little brook, which, as I have already said, was excellent water.\\n', '\\n', 'The ship came within half a league of this creek, and sent her long boat\\n', 'with vessels to take in fresh water (for the place, it seems, was very\\n', 'well known); but I did not observe it, till the boat was almost on shore;\\n', 'and it was too late to seek another hiding-place.  The seamen at their\\n', 'landing observed my canoe, and rummaging it all over, easily conjectured\\n', 'that the owner could not be far off.

They gazed awhile in admiration at my strange uncouth\\n', 'dress; my coat made of skins, my wooden-soled shoes, and my furred\\n', 'stockings; whence, however, they concluded, I was not a native of the\\n', 'place, who all go naked.  One of the seamen, in Portuguese, bid me rise,\\n', 'and asked who I was.  I understood that language very well, and getting\\n', 'upon my feet, said, “I was a poor _Yahoo_ banished from the _Houyhnhnms_,\\n', 'and desired they would please to let me depart.”  They admired to hear me\\n', 'answer them in their own tongue, and saw by my complexion I must be a\\n', 'European; but were at a loss to know what I meant by _Yahoos_ and\\n', '_Houyhnhnms_; and at the same time fell a-laughing at my strange tone in\\n', 'speaking, which resembled the neighing of a horse.  I trembled all the\\n', 'while betwixt fear and hatred.  I again desired leave to depart, and was\\n', 'gently moving to my canoe; but they laid hold of me, desiring to know,\\n', '“what country I was of? whence I came?” with many other questions.  I\\n', 'told them “I was born in England, whence I came about five years ago, and\\n', 'then their country and ours were at peace.  I therefore hoped they would\\n', 'not treat me as an enemy, since I meant them no harm, but was a poor\\n', '_Yahoo_ seeking some desolate place where to pass the remainder of his\\n', 'unfortunate life.”\\n', '\\n', 'When they began to talk, I thought I never heard or saw any thing more\\n', 'unnatural; for it appeared to me as monstrous as if a dog or a cow should\\n', 'speak in England, or a _Yahoo_ in _Houyhnhnmland_.  The honest Portuguese\\n', 'were equally amazed at my strange dress, and the odd manner of delivering\\n', 'my words, which, however, they understood very well.  They spoke to me\\n', 'with great humanity, and said, “they were sure the captain would carry me\\n', '_gratis_ to Lisbon, whence I might return to my own country; that two of\\n', 'the seamen would go back to the ship, inform the captain of what they had\\n', 'seen, and receive his orders; in the mean time, unless I would give my\\n', 'solemn oath not to fly, they would secure me by force.  I thought it best\\n', 'to comply with their proposal.  They were very curious to know my story,\\n', 'but I gave them very little satisfaction, and they all conjectured that\\n', 'my misfortunes had impaired my reason.  In two hours the boat, which went\\n', 'laden with vessels of water, returned, with the captain’s command to\\n', 'fetch me on board.  I fell on my knees to preserve my liberty; but all\\n', 'was in vain; and the men, having tied me with cords, heaved me into the\\n', 'boat, whence I was taken into the ship, and thence into the captain’s\\n', 'cabin.\\n', '\\n', 'His name was Pedro de Mendez; he was a very courteous and generous\\n', 'person.  He entreated me to give some account of myself, and desired to\\n', 'know what I would eat or drink; said, “I should be used as well as\\n', 'himself;” and spoke so many obliging things, that I wondered to find such\\n', 'civilities from a _Yahoo_.  However, I remained silent and sullen; I was\\n', 'ready to faint at the very smell of him and his men.  At last I desired\\n', 'something to eat out of my own canoe; but he ordered me a chicken, and\\n', 'some excellent wine, and then directed that I should be put to bed in a\\n', 'very clean cabin.  I would not undress myself, but lay on the\\n', 'bed-clothes, and in half an hour stole out, when I thought the crew was\\n', 'at dinner, and getting to the side of the ship, was going to leap into\\n', 'the sea, and swim for my life, rather than continue among _Yahoos_.  But\\n', 'one of the seamen prevented me, and having informed the captain, I was\\n', 'chained to my cabin.\\n', '\\n', 'After dinner, Don Pedro came to me, and desired to know my reason for so\\n', 'desperate an attempt; assured me, “he only meant to do me all the service\\n', 'he was able;” and spoke so very movingly, that at last I descended to\\n', 'treat him like an animal which had some little portion of reason.  I gave\\n', 'him a very short relation of my voyage; of the conspiracy against me by\\n', 'my own men; of the country where they set me on shore, and of my five\\n', 'years residence there.  All which he looked upon as if it were a dream or\\n', 'a vision; whereat I took great offence; for I had quite forgot the\\n', 'faculty of lying, so peculiar to _Yahoos_, in all countries where they\\n', 'preside, and, consequently, their disposition of suspecting truth in\\n', 'others of their own species.  I asked him, “whether it were the custom in\\n', 'his country to say the thing which was not?”  I assured him, “I had\\n', 'almost forgot what he meant by falsehood, and if I had lived a thousand\\n', 'years in _Houyhnhnmland_, I should never have heard a lie from the\\n', 'meanest servant; that I was altogether indifferent whether he believed me\\n', 'or not; but, however, in return for his favours, I would give so much\\n', 'allowance to the corruption of his nature, as to answer any objection he\\n', 'would please to make, and then he might easily discover the truth.”\\n', '\\n', 'The captain, a wise man, after many endeavours to catch me tripping in\\n', 'some part of my story, at last began to have a better opinion of my\\n', 'veracity.  But he added, “that since I professed so inviolable an\\n', 'attachment to truth, I must give him my word and honour to bear him\\n', 'company in this voyage, without attempting any thing against my life; or\\n', 'else he would continue me a prisoner till we arrived at Lisbon.”  I gave\\n', 'him the promise he required; but at the same time protested, “that I\\n', 'would suffer the greatest hardships, rather than return to live among\\n', '_Yahoos_.”\\n', '\\n', 'Our voyage passed without any considerable accident.  In gratitude to the\\n', 'captain, I sometimes sat with him, at his earnest request, and strove to\\n', 'conceal my antipathy against human kind, although it often broke out;\\n', 'which he suffered to pass without observation.  But the greatest part of\\n', 'the day I confined myself to my cabin, to avoid seeing any of the crew.\\n', 'The captain had often entreated me to strip myself of my savage dress,\\n', 'and offered to lend me the best suit of clothes he had.  This I would not\\n', 'be prevailed on to accept, abhorring to cover myself with any thing that\\n', 'had been on the back of a _Yahoo_.  I only desired he would lend me two\\n', 'clean shirts, which, having been washed since he wore them, I believed\\n', 'would not so much defile me.  These I changed every second day, and\\n', 'washed them myself.\\n', '\\n', 'We arrived at Lisbon, Nov. 5, 1715.  At our landing, the captain forced\\n', 'me to cover myself with his cloak, to prevent the rabble from crowding\\n', 'about me.  I was conveyed to his own house; and at my earnest request he\\n', 'led me up to the highest room backwards.  I conjured him “to conceal from\\n', 'all persons what I had told him of the _Houyhnhnms_; because the least\\n', 'hint of such a story would not only draw numbers of people to see me, but\\n', 'probably put me in danger of being imprisoned, or burnt by the\\n', 'Inquisition.”  The captain persuaded me to accept a suit of clothes newly\\n', 'made; but I would not suffer the tailor to take my measure; however, Don\\n', 'Pedro being almost of my size, they fitted me well enough.  He accoutred\\n', 'me with other necessaries, all new, which I aired for twenty-four hours\\n', 'before I would use them.\\n', '\\n', 'The captain had no wife, nor above three servants, none of which were\\n', 'suffered to attend at meals; and his whole deportment was so obliging,\\n', 'added to very good human understanding, that I really began to tolerate\\n', 'his company.  He gained so far upon me, that I ventured to look out of\\n', 'the back window.  By degrees I was brought into another room, whence I\\n', 'peeped into the street, but drew my head back in a fright.  In a week’s\\n', 'time he seduced me down to the door.  I found my terror gradually\\n', 'lessened, but my hatred and contempt seemed to increase.  I was at last\\n', 'bold enough to walk the street in his company, but kept my nose well\\n', 'stopped with rue, or sometimes with tobacco.\\n', '\\n', 'In ten days, Don Pedro, to whom I had given some account of my domestic\\n', 'affairs, put it upon me, as a matter of honour and conscience, “that I\\n', 'ought to return to my native country, and live at home with my wife and\\n', 'children.”  He told me, “there was an English ship in the port just ready\\n', 'to sail, and he would furnish me with all things necessary.”  It would be\\n', 'tedious to repeat his arguments, and my contradictions.  He said, “it was\\n', 'altogether impossible to find such a solitary island as I desired to live\\n', 'in; but I might command in my own house, and pass my time in a manner as\\n', 'recluse as I pleased.”\\n', '\\n', 'I complied at last, finding I could not do better.  I left Lisbon the\\n', '24th day of November, in an English merchantman, but who was the master I\\n', 'never inquired.  Don Pedro accompanied me to the ship, and lent me twenty\\n', 'pounds.  He took kind leave of me, and embraced me at parting, which I\\n', 'bore as well as I could.  During this last voyage I had no commerce with\\n', 'the master or any of his men; but, pretending I was sick, kept close in\\n', 'my cabin.  On the fifth of December, 1715, we cast anchor in the Downs,\\n', 'about nine in the morning, and at three in the afternoon I got safe to my\\n', 'house at Rotherhith. {546}\\n', '\\n', 'My wife and family received me with great surprise and joy, because they\\n', 'concluded me certainly dead; but I must freely confess the sight of them\\n', 'filled me only with hatred, disgust, and contempt; and the more, by\\n', 'reflecting on the near alliance I had to them.  For although, since my\\n', 'unfortunate exile from the _Houyhnhnm_ country, I had compelled myself to\\n', 'tolerate the sight of _Yahoos_, and to converse with Don Pedro de Mendez,\\n', 'yet my memory and imagination were perpetually filled with the virtues\\n', 'and ideas of those exalted _Houyhnhnms_.  And when I began to consider\\n', 'that, by copulating with one of the _Yahoo_ species I had become a parent\\n', 'of more, it struck me with the utmost shame, confusion, and horror.\\n', '\\n', 'As soon as I entered the house, my wife took me in her arms, and kissed\\n', 'me; at which, having not been used to the touch of that odious animal for\\n', 'so many years, I fell into a swoon for almost an hour.  At the time I am\\n', 'writing, it is five years since my last return to England.  During the\\n', 'first year, I could not endure my wife or children in my presence; the\\n', 'very smell of them was intolerable; much less could I suffer them to eat\\n', 'in the same room.  To this hour they dare not presume to touch my bread,\\n', 'or drink out of the same cup, neither was I ever able to let one of them\\n', 'take me by the hand.  The first money I laid out was to buy two young\\n', 'stone-horses, which I keep in a good stable; and next to them, the groom\\n', 'is my greatest favourite, for I feel my spirits revived by the smell he\\n', 'contracts in the stable.  My horses understand me tolerably well; I\\n', 'converse with them at least four hours every day.  They are strangers to\\n', 'bridle or saddle; they live in great amity with me and friendship to each\\n', 'other.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER XII.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The author’s veracity.

The method of\\n', 'planting colonies.  His native country commended.  The right of the crown\\n', 'to those countries described by the author is justified.  The difficulty\\n', 'of conquering them.  The author takes his last leave of the reader;\\n', 'proposes his manner of living for the future; gives good advice, and\\n', 'concludes.\\n', '\\n', 'Thus, gentle reader, I have given thee a faithful history of my travels\\n', 'for sixteen years and above seven months: wherein I have not been so\\n', 'studious of ornament as of truth.  I could, perhaps, like others, have\\n', 'astonished thee with strange improbable tales; but I rather chose to\\n', 'relate plain matter of fact, in the simplest manner and style; because my\\n', 'principal design was to inform, and not to amuse thee.\\n', '\\n', 'It is easy for us who travel into remote countries, which are seldom\\n', 'visited by Englishmen or other Europeans, to form descriptions of\\n', 'wonderful animals both at sea and land.  Whereas a traveller’s chief aim\\n', 'should be to make men wiser and better, and to improve their minds by the\\n', 'bad, as well as good, example of what they deliver concerning foreign\\n', 'places.\\n', '\\n', 'I could heartily wish a law was enacted, that every traveller, before he\\n', 'were permitted to publish his voyages, should be obliged to make oath\\n', 'before the Lord High Chancellor, that all he intended to print was\\n', 'absolutely true to the best of his knowledge; for then the world would no\\n', 'longer be deceived, as it usually is, while some writers, to make their\\n', 'works pass the better upon the public, impose the grossest falsities on\\n', 'the unwary reader.  I have perused several books of travels with great\\n', 'delight in my younger days; but having since gone over most parts of the\\n', 'globe, and been able to contradict many fabulous accounts from my own\\n', 'observation, it has given me a great disgust against this part of\\n', 'reading, and some indignation to see the credulity of mankind so\\n', 'impudently abused.  Therefore, since my acquaintance were pleased to\\n', 'think my poor endeavours might not be unacceptable to my country, I\\n', 'imposed on myself, as a maxim never to be swerved from, that I would\\n', 'strictly adhere to truth; neither indeed can I be ever under the least\\n', 'temptation to vary from it, while I retain in my mind the lectures and\\n', 'example of my noble master and the other illustrious _Houyhnhnms_ of whom\\n', 'I had so long the honour to be an humble hearer.\\n', '\\n', '    _—Nec si miserum Fortuna Sinonem_\\n', '    _Finxit_, _vanum etiam_, _mendacemque improba finget_.\\n', '\\n', 'I know very well, how little reputation is to be got by writings which\\n', 'require neither genius nor learning, nor indeed any other talent, except\\n', 'a good memory, or an exact journal.  I know likewise, that writers of\\n', 'travels, like dictionary-makers, are sunk into oblivion by the weight and\\n', 'bulk of those who come last, and therefore lie uppermost.  And it is\\n', 'highly probable, that such travellers, who shall hereafter visit the\\n', 'countries described in this work of mine, may, by detecting my errors (if\\n', 'there be any), and adding many new discoveries of their own, justle me\\n', 'out of vogue, and stand in my place, making the world forget that ever I\\n', 'was an author.  This indeed would be too great a mortification, if I\\n', 'wrote for fame: but as my sole intention was the public good, I cannot be\\n', 'altogether disappointed.  For who can read of the virtues I have\\n', 'mentioned in the glorious _Houyhnhnms_, without being ashamed of his own\\n', 'vices, when he considers himself as the reasoning, governing animal of\\n', 'his country?  I shall say nothing of those remote nations where _Yahoos_\\n', 'preside; among which the least corrupted are the _Brobdingnagians_; whose\\n', 'wise maxims in morality and government it would be our happiness to\\n', 'observe.  But I forbear descanting further, and rather leave the\\n', 'judicious reader to his own remarks and application.\\n', '\\n', 'I am not a little pleased that this work of mine can possibly meet with\\n', 'no censurers: for what objections can be made against a writer, who\\n', 'relates only plain facts, that happened in such distant countries, where\\n', 'we have not the least interest, with respect either to trade or\\n', 'negotiations?  I have carefully avoided every fault with which common\\n', 'writers of travels are often too justly charged.  Besides, I meddle not\\n', 'the least with any party, but write without passion, prejudice, or\\n', 'ill-will against any man, or number of men, whatsoever.  I write for the\\n', 'noblest end, to inform and instruct mankind; over whom I may, without\\n', 'breach of modesty, pretend to some superiority, from the advantages I\\n', 'received by conversing so long among the most accomplished _Houyhnhnms_.\\n', 'I write without any view to profit or praise.  I never suffer a word to\\n', 'pass that may look like reflection, or possibly give the least offence,\\n', 'even to those who are most ready to take it.  So that I hope I may with\\n', 'justice pronounce myself an author perfectly blameless; against whom the\\n', 'tribes of Answerers, Considerers, Observers, Reflectors, Detectors,\\n', 'Remarkers, will never be able to find matter for exercising their\\n', 'talents.\\n', '\\n', 'I confess, it was whispered to me, “that I was bound in duty, as a\\n', 'subject of England, to have given in a memorial to a secretary of state\\n', 'at my first coming over; because, whatever lands are discovered by a\\n', 'subject belong to the crown.”  But I doubt whether our conquests in the\\n', 'countries I treat of would be as easy as those of Ferdinando Cortez over\\n', 'the naked Americans.  The _Lilliputians_, I think, are hardly worth the\\n', 'charge of a fleet and army to reduce them; and I question whether it\\n', 'might be prudent or safe to attempt the _Brobdingnagians_; or whether an\\n', 'English army would be much at their ease with the Flying Island over\\n', 'their heads.  The _Houyhnhnms_ indeed appear not to be so well prepared\\n', 'for war, a science to which they are perfect strangers, and especially\\n', 'against missive weapons.  However, supposing myself to be a minister of\\n', 'state, I could never give my advice for invading them.  Their prudence,\\n', 'unanimity, unacquaintedness with fear, and their love of their country,\\n', 'would amply supply all defects in the military art.  Imagine twenty\\n', 'thousand of them breaking into the midst of an European army, confounding\\n', 'the ranks, overturning the carriages, battering the warriors’ faces into\\n', 'mummy by terrible yerks from their hinder hoofs; for they would well\\n', 'deserve the character given to Augustus, _Recalcitrat undique tutus_.\\n', 'But, instead of proposals for conquering that magnanimous nation, I\\n', 'rather wish they were in a capacity, or disposition, to send a sufficient\\n', 'number of their inhabitants for civilizing Europe, by teaching us the\\n', 'first principles of honour, justice, truth, temperance, public spirit,\\n', 'fortitude, chastity, friendship, benevolence, and fidelity.  The names of\\n', 'all which virtues are still retained among us in most languages, and are\\n', 'to be met with in modern, as well as ancient authors; which I am able to\\n', 'assert from my own small reading.\\n', '\\n', 'But I had another reason, which made me less forward to enlarge his\\n', 'majesty’s dominions by my discoveries.  To say the truth, I had conceived\\n', 'a few scruples with relation to the distributive justice of princes upon\\n', 'those occasions.  For instance, a crew of pirates are driven by a storm\\n', 'they know not whither; at length a boy discovers land from the topmast;\\n', 'they go on shore to rob and plunder, they see a harmless people, are\\n', 'entertained with kindness; they give the country a new name; they take\\n', 'formal possession of it for their king; they set up a rotten plank, or a\\n', 'stone, for a memorial; they murder two or three dozen of the natives,\\n', 'bring away a couple more, by force, for a sample; return home, and get\\n', 'their pardon.  Here commences a new dominion acquired with a title by\\n', 'divine right.  Ships are sent with the first opportunity; the natives\\n', 'driven out or destroyed; their princes tortured to discover their gold; a\\n', 'free license given to all acts of inhumanity and lust, the earth reeking\\n', 'with the blood of its inhabitants: and this execrable crew of butchers,\\n', 'employed in so pious an expedition, is a modern colony, sent to convert\\n', 'and civilize an idolatrous and barbarous people!\\n', '\\n', 'But this description, I confess, does by no means affect the British\\n', 'nation, who may be an example to the whole world for their wisdom, care,\\n', 'and justice in planting colonies; their liberal endowments for the\\n', 'advancement of religion and learning; their choice of devout and able\\n', 'pastors to propagate Christianity; their caution in stocking their\\n', 'provinces with people of sober lives and conversations from this the\\n', 'mother kingdom; their strict regard to the distribution of justice, in\\n', 'supplying the civil administration through all their colonies with\\n', 'officers of the greatest abilities, utter strangers to corruption; and,\\n', 'to crown all, by sending the most vigilant and virtuous governors, who\\n', 'have no other views than the happiness of the people over whom they\\n', 'preside, and the honour of the king their master.\\n', '\\n', 'But as those countries which I have described do not appear to have any\\n', 'desire of being conquered and enslaved, murdered or driven out by\\n', 'colonies, nor abound either in gold, silver, sugar, or tobacco, I did\\n', 'humbly conceive, they were by no means proper objects of our zeal, our\\n', 'valour, or our interest.  However, if those whom it more concerns think\\n', 'fit to be of another opinion, I am ready to depose, when I shall be\\n', 'lawfully called, that no European did ever visit those countries before\\n', 'me.  I mean, if the inhabitants ought to be believed, unless a dispute\\n', 'may arise concerning the two _Yahoos_, said to have been seen many years\\n', 'ago upon a mountain in _Houyhnhnmland_.\\n', '\\n', 'But, as to the formality of taking possession in my sovereign’s name, it\\n', 'never came once into my thoughts; and if it had, yet, as my affairs then\\n', 'stood, I should perhaps, in point of prudence and self-preservation, have\\n', 'put it off to a better opportunity.\\n', '\\n', 'Having thus answered the only objection that can ever be raised against\\n', 'me as a traveller, I here take a final leave of all my courteous readers,\\n', 'and return to enjoy my own speculations in my little garden at Redriff;\\n', 'to apply those excellent lessons of virtue which I learned among the\\n', '_Houyhnhnms_; to instruct the _Yahoos_ of my own family, is far as I\\n', 'shall find them docible animals; to behold my figure often in a glass,\\n', 'and thus, if possible, habituate myself by time to tolerate the sight of\\n', 'a human creature; to lament the brutality to _Houyhnhnms_ in my own\\n', 'country, but always treat their persons with respect, for the sake of my\\n', 'noble master, his family, his friends, and the whole _Houyhnhnm_ race,\\n', 'whom these of ours have the honour to resemble in all their lineaments,\\n', 'however their intellectuals came to degenerate.\\n', '\\n', 'I began last week to permit my wife to sit at dinner with me, at the\\n', 'farthest end of a long table; and to answer (but with the utmost brevity)\\n', 'the few questions I asked her.

And, although it be hard for a man late in life to\\n', 'remove old habits, I am not altogether out of hopes, in some time, to\\n', 'suffer a neighbour _Yahoo_ in my company, without the apprehensions I am\\n', 'yet under of his teeth or his claws.\\n', '\\n', 'My reconcilement to the _Yahoo_ kind in general might not be so\\n', 'difficult, if they would be content with those vices and follies only\\n', 'which nature has entitled them to.

      "\n",
      "The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient and\n",
      "intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us on the\n",
      "mother’s side.  About three years ago, Mr. Gulliver growing weary of the\n",
      "concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff, made a\n",
      "small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark, in\n",
      "Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet in\n",
      "good esteem among his neighbours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his father\n",
      "dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from Oxfordshire; to\n",
      "confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at Banbury in that\n",
      "county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following papers in\n",
      "my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should think fit.  I\n",
      "have carefully perused them three times.  The style is very plain and\n",
      "simple; and the only fault I find is, that the author, after the manner\n",
      "of travellers, is a little too circumstantial.  There is an air of truth\n",
      "apparent through the whole; and indeed the author was so distinguished\n",
      "for his veracity, that it became a sort of proverb among his neighbours\n",
      "at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing, to say, it was as true as if\n",
      "Mr. Gulliver had spoken it.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the author’s\n",
      "permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to send them into\n",
      "the world, hoping they may be, at least for some time, a better\n",
      "entertainment to our young noblemen, than the common scribbles of\n",
      "politics and party.\n",
      "\n",
      "This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not made\n",
      "bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and tides,\n",
      "as well as to the variations and bearings in the several voyages,\n",
      "together with the minute descriptions of the management of the ship in\n",
      "storms, in the style of sailors; likewise the account of longitudes and\n",
      "latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend, that Mr. Gulliver may be a\n",
      "little dissatisfied.  But I was resolved to fit the work as much as\n",
      "possible to the general capacity of readers.  However, if my own\n",
      "ignorance in sea affairs shall have led me to commit some mistakes, I\n",
      "alone am answerable for them.  And if any traveller hath a curiosity to\n",
      "see the whole work at large, as it came from the hands of the author, I\n",
      "will be ready to gratify him.\n",

      "I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be called to\n",
      "it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on me to\n",
      "publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels, with directions\n",
      "to hire some young gentleman of either university to put them in order,\n",
      "and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did, by my advice, in his\n",
      "book called “A Voyage round the world.”  But I do not remember I gave you\n",
      "power to consent that any thing should be omitted, and much less that any\n",
      "thing should be inserted; therefore, as to the latter, I do here renounce\n",
      "every thing of that kind; particularly a paragraph about her majesty\n",
      "Queen Anne, of most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence\n",
      "and esteem her more than any of human species.  But you, or your\n",
      "interpolator, ought to have considered, that it was not my inclination,\n",
      "so was it not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my\n",
      "master _Houyhnhnm_: And besides, the fact was altogether false; for to my\n",
      "knowledge, being in England during some part of her majesty’s reign, she\n",
      "did govern by a chief minister; nay even by two successively, the first\n",
      "whereof was the lord of Godolphin, and the second the lord of Oxford; so\n",
      "that you have made me say the thing that was not.  Likewise in the\n",
      "account of the academy of projectors, and several passages of my\n",
      "discourse to my master _Houyhnhnm_, you have either omitted some material\n",
      "circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner, that I do\n",
      "hardly know my own work.  When I formerly hinted to you something of this\n",
      "in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you were afraid of giving\n",
      "offence; that people in power were very watchful over the press, and apt\n",
      "not only to interpret, but to punish every thing which looked like an\n",
      "_innuendo_ (as I think you call it).  But, pray how could that which I\n",
      "spoke so many years ago, and at about five thousand leagues distance, in\n",
      "another reign, be applied to any of the _Yahoos_, who now are said to\n",
      "govern the herd; especially at a time when I little thought, or feared,\n",
      "the unhappiness of living under them?  Have not I the most reason to\n",
      "complain, when I see these very _Yahoos_ carried by _Houyhnhnms_ in a\n",
      "vehicle, as if they were brutes, and those the rational creatures?  And\n",
      "indeed to avoid so monstrous and detestable a sight was one principal\n",
      "motive of my retirement hither.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself, and to\n",
      "the trust I reposed in you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do, in the next place, complain of my own great want of judgment, in\n",
      "being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasoning of you and\n",
      "some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my travels to be\n",
      "published.  Pray bring to your mind how often I desired you to consider,\n",
      "when you insisted on the motive of public good, that the _Yahoos_ were a\n",
      "species of animals utterly incapable of amendment by precept or example:\n",
      "and so it has proved; for, instead of seeing a full stop put to all\n",
      "abuses and corruptions, at least in this little island, as I had reason\n",
      "to expect; behold, after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my\n",
      "book has produced one single effect according to my intentions.  I\n",
      "desired you would let me know, by a letter, when party and faction were\n",
      "extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and modest,\n",
      "with some tincture of common sense, and Smithfield blazing with pyramids\n",
      "of law books; the young nobility’s education entirely changed; the\n",
      "physicians banished; the female _Yahoos_ abounding in virtue, honour,\n",
      "truth, and good sense; courts and levees of great ministers thoroughly\n",
      "weeded and swept; wit, merit, and learning rewarded; all disgracers of\n",
      "the press in prose and verse condemned to eat nothing but their own\n",
      "cotton, and quench their thirst with their own ink.  These, and a\n",
      "thousand other reformations, I firmly counted upon by your encouragement;\n",
      "as indeed they were plainly deducible from the precepts delivered in my\n",
      "book.  And it must be owned, that seven months were a sufficient time to\n",
      "correct every vice and folly to which _Yahoos_ are subject, if their\n",
      "natures had been capable of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom.\n",
      "Yet, so far have you been from answering my expectation in any of your\n",
      "letters; that on the contrary you are loading our carrier every week with\n",
      "libels, and keys, and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein\n",
      "I see myself accused of reflecting upon great state folk; of degrading\n",
      "human nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of\n",
      "abusing the female sex.  I find likewise that the writers of those\n",
      "bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not allow\n",
      "me to be the author of my own travels; and others make me author of books\n",
      "to which I am wholly a stranger.\n",
      "\n",
      "I find likewise that your printer has been so careless as to confound the\n",
      "times, and mistake the dates, of my several voyages and returns; neither\n",
      "assigning the true year, nor the true month, nor day of the month: and I\n",
      "hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since the publication of my\n",
      "book; neither have I any copy left: however, I have sent you some\n",
      "corrections, which you may insert, if ever there should be a second\n",
      "edition: and yet I cannot stand to them; but shall leave that matter to\n",
      "my judicious and candid readers to adjust it as they please.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hear some of our sea _Yahoos_ find fault with my sea-language, as not\n",
      "proper in many parts, nor now in use.  I cannot help it.  In my first\n",
      "voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest mariners, and\n",
      "learned to speak as they did.  But I have since found that the sea\n",
      "_Yahoos_ are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled in their\n",
      "words, which the latter change every year; insomuch, as I remember upon\n",
      "each return to my own country their old dialect was so altered, that I\n",
      "could hardly understand the new.  And I observe, when any _Yahoo_ comes\n",
      "from London out of curiosity to visit me at my house, we neither of us\n",
      "are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner intelligible to the\n",
      "other.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the censure of the _Yahoos_ could any way affect me, I should have\n",
      "great reason to complain, that some of them are so bold as to think my\n",
      "book of travels a mere fiction out of mine own brain, and have gone so\n",
      "far as to drop hints, that the _Houyhnhnms_ and _Yahoos_ have no more\n",
      "existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of _Lilliput_, _Brobdingrag_\n",
      "(for so the word should have been spelt, and not erroneously\n",
      "_Brobdingnag_), and _Laputa_, I have never yet heard of any _Yahoo_ so\n",
      "presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have related\n",
      "concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every reader with\n",
      "conviction.  And is there less probability in my account of the\n",
      "_Houyhnhnms_ or _Yahoos_, when it is manifest as to the latter, there are\n",
      "so many thousands even in this country, who only differ from their\n",
      "brother brutes in _Houyhnhnmland_, because they use a sort of jabber, and\n",
      "do not go naked?  I wrote for their amendment, and not their approbation.\n",
      "The united praise of the whole race would be of less consequence to me,\n",
      "than the neighing of those two degenerate _Houyhnhnms_ I keep in my\n",
      "stable; because from these, degenerate as they are, I still improve in\n",
      "some virtues without any mixture of vice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do these miserable animals presume to think, that I am so degenerated as\n",
      "to defend my veracity?  _Yahoo_ as I am, it is well known through all\n",
      "_Houyhnhnmland_, that, by the instructions and example of my illustrious\n",
      "master, I was able in the compass of two years (although I confess with\n",
      "the utmost difficulty) to remove that infernal habit of lying, shuffling,\n",
      "deceiving, and equivocating, so deeply rooted in the very souls of all my\n",
      "species; especially the Europeans.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but I\n",
      "forbear troubling myself or you any further.  I must freely confess, that\n",
      "since my last return, some corruptions of my _Yahoo_ nature have revived\n",
      "in me by conversing with a few of your species, and particularly those of\n",
      "my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else I should never have\n",

      "being too great for a narrow fortune, I was bound apprentice to Mr. James\n",
      "Bates, an eminent surgeon in London, with whom I continued four years.\n",

      "father: where, by the assistance of him and my uncle John, and some other\n",
      "relations, I got forty pounds, and a promise of thirty pounds a year to\n",
      "maintain me at Leyden: there I studied physic two years and seven months,\n",
      "knowing it would be useful in long voyages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after my return from Leyden, I was recommended by my good master,\n",

      "commander; with whom I continued three years and a half, making a voyage\n",
      "or two into the Levant, and some other parts.  When I came back I\n",
      "resolved to settle in London; to which Mr. Bates, my master, encouraged\n",
      "me, and by him I was recommended to several patients.  I took part of a\n",
      "small house in the Old Jewry; and being advised to alter my condition, I\n",
      "married Mrs. Mary Burton, second daughter to Mr. Edmund Burton, hosier,\n",
      "in Newgate-street, with whom I received four hundred pounds for a\n",
      "portion.\n",
      "\n",
      "But my good master Bates dying in two years after, and I having few\n",
      "friends, my business began to fail; for my conscience would not suffer me\n",
      "to imitate the bad practice of too many among my brethren.  Having\n",
      "therefore consulted with my wife, and some of my acquaintance, I\n",
      "determined to go again to sea.  I was surgeon successively in two ships,\n",
      "and made several voyages, for six years, to the East and West Indies, by\n",
      "which I got some addition to my fortune.  My hours of leisure I spent in\n",
      "reading the best authors, ancient and modern, being always provided with\n",
      "a good number of books; and when I was ashore, in observing the manners\n",
      "and dispositions of the people, as well as learning their language;\n",
      "wherein I had a great facility, by the strength of my memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last of these voyages not proving very fortunate, I grew weary of the\n",
      "sea, and intended to stay at home with my wife and family.  I removed\n",
      "from the Old Jewry to Fetter Lane, and from thence to Wapping, hoping to\n",
      "get business among the sailors; but it would not turn to account.  After\n",
      "three years expectation that things would mend, I accepted an\n",
      "advantageous offer from Captain William Prichard, master of the Antelope,\n",
      "who was making a voyage to the South Sea.  We set sail from Bristol, May\n",
      "4, 1699, and our voyage was at first very prosperous.\n",

      "by a violent storm to the north-west of Van Diemen’s Land.  By an\n",
      "observation, we found ourselves in the latitude of 30 degrees 2 minutes\n",
      "south.  Twelve of our crew were dead by immoderate labour and ill food;\n",
      "the rest were in a very weak condition.  On the 5th of November, which\n",
      "was the beginning of summer in those parts, the weather being very hazy,\n",
      "the seamen spied a rock within half a cable’s length of the ship; but the\n",
      "wind was so strong, that we were driven directly upon it, and immediately\n",
      "split.  Six of the crew, of whom I was one, having let down the boat into\n",
      "the sea, made a shift to get clear of the ship and the rock.  We rowed,\n",
      "by my computation, about three leagues, till we were able to work no\n",
      "longer, being already spent with labour while we were in the ship.  We\n",
      "therefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves, and in about half\n",
      "an hour the boat was overset by a sudden flurry from the north.  What\n",
      "became of my companions in the boat, as well as of those who escaped on\n",
      "the rock, or were left in the vessel, I cannot tell; but conclude they\n",
      "were all lost.  For my own part, I swam as fortune directed me, and was\n",
      "pushed forward by wind and tide.  I often let my legs drop, and could\n",
      "feel no bottom; but when I was almost gone, and able to struggle no\n",
      "longer, I found myself within my depth; and by this time the storm was\n",
      "much abated.  The declivity was so small, that I walked near a mile\n",
      "before I got to the shore, which I conjectured was about eight o’clock in\n",
      "the evening.  I then advanced forward near half a mile, but could not\n",
      "discover any sign of houses or inhabitants; at least I was in so weak a\n",
      "condition, that I did not observe them.  I was extremely tired, and with\n",
      "that, and the heat of the weather, and about half a pint of brandy that I\n",
      "drank as I left the ship, I found myself much inclined to sleep.  I lay\n",
      "down on the grass, which was very short and soft, where I slept sounder\n",
      "than ever I remembered to have done in my life, and, as I reckoned, about\n",
      "nine hours; for when I awaked, it was just day-light.  I attempted to\n",
      "rise, but was not able to stir: for, as I happened to lie on my back, I\n",
      "found my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to the ground;\n",
      "and my hair, which was long and thick, tied down in the same manner.  I\n",
      "likewise felt several slender ligatures across my body, from my arm-pits\n",
      "to my thighs.  I could only look upwards; the sun began to grow hot, and\n",
      "the light offended my eyes.  I heard a confused noise about me; but in\n",
      "the posture I lay, could see nothing except the sky.  In a little time I\n",
      "felt something alive moving on my left leg, which advancing gently\n",
      "forward over my breast, came almost up to my chin; when, bending my eyes\n",
      "downwards as much as I could, I perceived it to be a human creature not\n",
      "six inches high, with a bow and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his\n",
      "back.  In the mean time, I felt at least forty more of the same kind (as\n",
      "I conjectured) following the first.  I was in the utmost astonishment,\n",
      "and roared so loud, that they all ran back in a fright; and some of them,\n",
      "as I was afterwards told, were hurt with the falls they got by leaping\n",
      "from my sides upon the ground.  However, they soon returned, and one of\n",
      "them, who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face, lifting up\n",
      "his hands and eyes by way of admiration, cried out in a shrill but\n",
      "distinct voice, _Hekinah degul_: the others repeated the same words\n",
      "several times, but then I knew not what they meant.  I lay all this\n",
      "while, as the reader may believe, in great uneasiness.  At length,\n",
      "struggling to get loose, I had the fortune to break the strings, and\n",
      "wrench out the pegs that fastened my left arm to the ground; for, by\n",
      "lifting it up to my face, I discovered the methods they had taken to bind\n",
      "me, and at the same time with a violent pull, which gave me excessive\n",
      "pain, I a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair on the left\n",
      "side, so that I was just able to turn my head about two inches.  But the\n",
      "creatures ran off a second time, before I could seize them; whereupon\n",
      "there was a great shout in a very shrill accent, and after it ceased I\n",
      "heard one of them cry aloud _Tolgo phonac_; when in an instant I felt\n",
      "above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand, which, pricked me like\n",
      "so many needles; and besides, they shot another flight into the air, as\n",
      "we do bombs in Europe, whereof many, I suppose, fell on my body, (though\n",
      "I felt them not), and some on my face, which I immediately covered with\n",
      "my left hand.  When this shower of arrows was over, I fell a groaning\n",
      "with grief and pain; and then striving again to get loose, they\n",
      "discharged another volley larger than the first, and some of them\n",
      "attempted with spears to stick me in the sides; but by good luck I had on\n",
      "a buff jerkin, which they could not pierce.  I thought it the most\n",
      "prudent method to lie still, and my design was to continue so till night,\n",
      "when, my left hand being already loose, I could easily free myself: and\n",
      "as for the inhabitants, I had reason to believe I might be a match for\n",
      "the greatest army they could bring against me, if they were all of the\n",
      "same size with him that I saw.  But fortune disposed otherwise of me.\n",
      "When the people observed I was quiet, they discharged no more arrows;\n",
      "but, by the noise I heard, I knew their numbers increased; and about four\n",
      "yards from me, over against my right ear, I heard a knocking for above an\n",
      "hour, like that of people at work; when turning my head that way, as well\n",
      "as the pegs and strings would permit me, I saw a stage erected about a\n",
      "foot and a half from the ground, capable of holding four of the\n",
      "inhabitants, with two or three ladders to mount it: from whence one of\n",
      "them, who seemed to be a person of quality, made me a long speech,\n",
      "whereof I understood not one syllable.  But I should have mentioned, that\n",
      "before the principal person began his oration, he cried out three times,\n",
      "_Langro dehul san_ (these words and the former were afterwards repeated\n",
      "and explained to me); whereupon, immediately, about fifty of the\n",
      "inhabitants came and cut the strings that fastened the left side of my\n",
      "head, which gave me the liberty of turning it to the right, and of\n",
      "observing the person and gesture of him that was to speak.  He appeared\n",
      "to be of a middle age, and taller than any of the other three who\n",
      "attended him, whereof one was a page that held up his train, and seemed\n",
      "to be somewhat longer than my middle finger; the other two stood one on\n",
      "each side to support him.  He acted every part of an orator, and I could\n",
      "observe many periods of threatenings, and others of promises, pity, and\n",
      "kindness.  I answered in a few words, but in the most submissive manner,\n",
      "lifting up my left hand, and both my eyes to the sun, as calling him for\n",
      "a witness; and being almost famished with hunger, having not eaten a\n",
      "morsel for some hours before I left the ship, I found the demands of\n",
      "nature so strong upon me, that I could not forbear showing my impatience\n",
      "(perhaps against the strict rules of decency) by putting my finger\n",
      "frequently to my mouth, to signify that I wanted food.  The _hurgo_ (for\n",
      "so they call a great lord, as I afterwards learnt) understood me very\n",
      "well.  He descended from the stage, and commanded that several ladders\n",
      "should be applied to my sides, on which above a hundred of the\n",
      "inhabitants mounted and walked towards my mouth, laden with baskets full\n",
      "of meat, which had been provided and sent thither by the king’s orders,\n",
      "upon the first intelligence he received of me.  I observed there was the\n",
      "flesh of several animals, but could not distinguish them by the taste.\n",
      "There were shoulders, legs, and loins, shaped like those of mutton, and\n",
      "very well dressed, but smaller than the wings of a lark.  I ate them by\n",
      "two or three at a mouthful, and took three loaves at a time, about the\n",
      "bigness of musket bullets.  They supplied me as fast as they could,\n",
      "showing a thousand marks of wonder and astonishment at my bulk and\n",
      "appetite.  I then made another sign, that I wanted drink.  They found by\n",
      "my eating that a small quantity would not suffice me; and being a most\n",
      "ingenious people, they slung up, with great dexterity, one of their\n",
      "largest hogsheads, then rolled it towards my hand, and beat out the top;\n",
      "I drank it off at a draught, which I might well do, for it did not hold\n",
      "half a pint, and tasted like a small wine of Burgundy, but much more\n",
      "delicious.  They brought me a second hogshead, which I drank in the same\n",
      "manner, and made signs for more; but they had none to give me.  When I\n",
      "had performed these wonders, they shouted for joy, and danced upon my\n",
      "breast, repeating several times as they did at first, _Hekinah degul_.\n",
      "They made me a sign that I should throw down the two hogsheads, but first\n",
      "warning the people below to stand out of the way, crying aloud, _Borach\n",
      "mevolah_; and when they saw the vessels in the air, there was a universal\n",
      "shout of _Hekinah degul_.  I confess I was often tempted, while they were\n",
      "passing backwards and forwards on my body, to seize forty or fifty of the\n",
      "first that came in my reach, and dash them against the ground.  But the\n",
      "remembrance of what I had felt, which probably might not be the worst\n",
      "they could do, and the promise of honour I made them—for so I interpreted\n",
      "my submissive behaviour—soon drove out these imaginations.  Besides, I\n",
      "now considered myself as bound by the laws of hospitality, to a people\n",
      "who had treated me with so much expense and magnificence.  However, in my\n",
      "thoughts I could not sufficiently wonder at the intrepidity of these\n",
      "diminutive mortals, who durst venture to mount and walk upon my body,\n",
      "while one of my hands was at liberty, without trembling at the very sight\n",
      "of so prodigious a creature as I must appear to them.  After some time,\n",
      "when they observed that I made no more demands for meat, there appeared\n",
      "before me a person of high rank from his imperial majesty.  His\n",
      "excellency, having mounted on the small of my right leg, advanced\n",
      "forwards up to my face, with about a dozen of his retinue; and producing\n",
      "his credentials under the signet royal, which he applied close to my\n",
      "eyes, spoke about ten minutes without any signs of anger, but with a kind\n",
      "of determinate resolution, often pointing forwards, which, as I\n",
      "afterwards found, was towards the capital city, about half a mile\n",
      "distant; whither it was agreed by his majesty in council that I must be\n",
      "conveyed.  I answered in few words, but to no purpose, and made a sign\n",
      "with my hand that was loose, putting it to the other (but over his\n",
      "excellency’s head for fear of hurting him or his train) and then to my\n",
      "own head and body, to signify that I desired my liberty.  It appeared\n",
      "that he understood me well enough, for he shook his head by way of\n",
      "disapprobation, and held his hand in a posture to show that I must be\n",
      "carried as a prisoner.  However, he made other signs to let me understand\n",
      "that I should have meat and drink enough, and very good treatment.\n",
      "Whereupon I once more thought of attempting to break my bonds; but again,\n",
      "when I felt the smart of their arrows upon my face and hands, which were\n",
      "all in blisters, and many of the darts still sticking in them, and\n",
      "observing likewise that the number of my enemies increased, I gave tokens\n",
      "to let them know that they might do with me what they pleased.  Upon\n",
      "this, the _hurgo_ and his train withdrew, with much civility and cheerful\n",
      "countenances.  Soon after I heard a general shout, with frequent\n",
      "repetitions of the words _Peplom selan_; and I felt great numbers of\n",
      "people on my left side relaxing the cords to such a degree, that I was\n",
      "able to turn upon my right, and to ease myself with making water; which I\n",
      "very plentifully did, to the great astonishment of the people; who,\n",
      "conjecturing by my motion what I was going to do, immediately opened to\n",
      "the right and left on that side, to avoid the torrent, which fell with\n",
      "such noise and violence from me.  But before this, they had daubed my\n",
      "face and both my hands with a sort of ointment, very pleasant to the\n",
      "smell, which, in a few minutes, removed all the smart of their arrows.\n",
      "These circumstances, added to the refreshment I had received by their\n",
      "victuals and drink, which were very nourishing, disposed me to sleep.  I\n",
      "slept about eight hours, as I was afterwards assured; and it was no\n",
      "wonder, for the physicians, by the emperor’s order, had mingled a sleepy\n",
      "potion in the hogsheads of wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems, that upon the first moment I was discovered sleeping on the\n",
      "ground, after my landing, the emperor had early notice of it by an\n",
      "express; and determined in council, that I should be tied in the manner I\n",
      "have related, (which was done in the night while I slept;) that plenty of\n",
      "meat and drink should be sent to me, and a machine prepared to carry me\n",
      "to the capital city.\n",
      "\n",
      "This resolution perhaps may appear very bold and dangerous, and I am\n",
      "confident would not be imitated by any prince in Europe on the like\n",
      "occasion.  However, in my opinion, it was extremely prudent, as well as\n",
      "generous: for, supposing these people had endeavoured to kill me with\n",
      "their spears and arrows, while I was asleep, I should certainly have\n",
      "awaked with the first sense of smart, which might so far have roused my\n",
      "rage and strength, as to have enabled me to break the strings wherewith I\n",
      "was tied; after which, as they were not able to make resistance, so they\n",
      "could expect no mercy.\n",
      "\n",
      "These people are most excellent mathematicians, and arrived to a great\n",
      "perfection in mechanics, by the countenance and encouragement of the\n",
      "emperor, who is a renowned patron of learning.  This prince has several\n",
      "machines fixed on wheels, for the carriage of trees and other great\n",
      "weights.  He often builds his largest men of war, whereof some are nine\n",
      "feet long, in the woods where the timber grows, and has them carried on\n",
      "these engines three or four hundred yards to the sea.  Five hundred\n",
      "carpenters and engineers were immediately set at work to prepare the\n",
      "greatest engine they had.  It was a frame of wood raised three inches\n",
      "from the ground, about seven feet long, and four wide, moving upon\n",
      "twenty-two wheels.  The shout I heard was upon the arrival of this\n",
      "engine, which, it seems, set out in four hours after my landing.  It was\n",
      "brought parallel to me, as I lay.  But the principal difficulty was to\n",
      "raise and place me in this vehicle.  Eighty poles, each of one foot high,\n",
      "were erected for this purpose, and very strong cords, of the bigness of\n",
      "packthread, were fastened by hooks to many bandages, which the workmen\n",
      "had girt round my neck, my hands, my body, and my legs.  Nine hundred of\n",
      "the strongest men were employed to draw up these cords, by many pulleys\n",
      "fastened on the poles; and thus, in less than three hours, I was raised\n",
      "and slung into the engine, and there tied fast.  All this I was told;\n",
      "for, while the operation was performing, I lay in a profound sleep, by\n",
      "the force of that soporiferous medicine infused into my liquor.  Fifteen\n",
      "hundred of the emperor’s largest horses, each about four inches and a\n",
      "half high, were employed to draw me towards the metropolis, which, as I\n",
      "said, was half a mile distant.\n",
      "\n",
      "About four hours after we began our journey, I awaked by a very\n",
      "ridiculous accident; for the carriage being stopped a while, to adjust\n",
      "something that was out of order, two or three of the young natives had\n",
      "the curiosity to see how I looked when I was asleep; they climbed up into\n",
      "the engine, and advancing very softly to my face, one of them, an officer\n",
      "in the guards, put the sharp end of his half-pike a good way up into my\n",
      "left nostril, which tickled my nose like a straw, and made me sneeze\n",
      "violently; whereupon they stole off unperceived, and it was three weeks\n",
      "before I knew the cause of my waking so suddenly.  We made a long march\n",
      "the remaining part of the day, and, rested at night with five hundred\n",
      "guards on each side of me, half with torches, and half with bows and\n",
      "arrows, ready to shoot me if I should offer to stir.  The next morning at\n",
      "sun-rise we continued our march, and arrived within two hundred yards of\n",
      "the city gates about noon.  The emperor, and all his court, came out to\n",
      "meet us; but his great officers would by no means suffer his majesty to\n",
      "endanger his person by mounting on my body.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the place where the carriage stopped there stood an ancient temple,\n",
      "esteemed to be the largest in the whole kingdom; which, having been\n",
      "polluted some years before by an unnatural murder, was, according to the\n",
      "zeal of those people, looked upon as profane, and therefore had been\n",
      "applied to common use, and all the ornaments and furniture carried away.\n",
      "In this edifice it was determined I should lodge.  The great gate\n",
      "fronting to the north was about four feet high, and almost two feet wide,\n",
      "through which I could easily creep.  On each side of the gate was a small\n",
      "window, not above six inches from the ground: into that on the left side,\n",
      "the king’s smith conveyed fourscore and eleven chains, like those that\n",
      "hang to a lady’s watch in Europe, and almost as large, which were locked\n",
      "to my left leg with six-and-thirty padlocks.  Over against this temple,\n",
      "on the other side of the great highway, at twenty feet distance, there\n",
      "was a turret at least five feet high.  Here the emperor ascended, with\n",
      "many principal lords of his court, to have an opportunity of viewing me,\n",
      "as I was told, for I could not see them.  It was reckoned that above a\n",
      "hundred thousand inhabitants came out of the town upon the same errand;\n",
      "and, in spite of my guards, I believe there could not be fewer than ten\n",
      "thousand at several times, who mounted my body by the help of ladders.\n",
      "But a proclamation was soon issued, to forbid it upon pain of death.\n",
      "When the workmen found it was impossible for me to break loose, they cut\n",
      "all the strings that bound me; whereupon I rose up, with as melancholy a\n",
      "disposition as ever I had in my life.  But the noise and astonishment of\n",
      "the people, at seeing me rise and walk, are not to be expressed.  The\n",
      "chains that held my left leg were about two yards long, and gave me not\n",
      "only the liberty of walking backwards and forwards in a semicircle, but,\n",
      "being fixed within four inches of the gate, allowed me to creep in, and\n",
      "lie at my full length in the temple.\n",

      "CHAPTER II.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The emperor of Lilliput, attended by several of the nobility, comes to\n",
      "see the author in his confinement.  The emperor’s person and habit\n",
      "described.  Learned men appointed to teach the author their language.  He\n",
      "gains favour by his mild disposition.  His pockets are searched, and his\n",
      "sword and pistols taken from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I found myself on my feet, I looked about me, and must confess I\n",
      "never beheld a more entertaining prospect.  The country around appeared\n",
      "like a continued garden, and the enclosed fields, which were generally\n",
      "forty feet square, resembled so many beds of flowers.  These fields were\n",
      "intermingled with woods of half a stang, {301} and the tallest trees, as\n",
      "I could judge, appeared to be seven feet high.  I viewed the town on my\n",
      "left hand, which looked like the painted scene of a city in a theatre.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had been for some hours extremely pressed by the necessities of nature;\n",
      "which was no wonder, it being almost two days since I had last\n",
      "disburdened myself.  I was under great difficulties between urgency and\n",
      "shame.  The best expedient I could think of, was to creep into my house,\n",
      "which I accordingly did; and shutting the gate after me, I went as far as\n",
      "the length of my chain would suffer, and discharged my body of that\n",
      "uneasy load.  But this was the only time I was ever guilty of so\n",
      "uncleanly an action; for which I cannot but hope the candid reader will\n",
      "give some allowance, after he has maturely and impartially considered my\n",
      "case, and the distress I was in.  From this time my constant practice\n",
      "was, as soon as I rose, to perform that business in open air, at the full\n",
      "extent of my chain; and due care was taken every morning before company\n",
      "came, that the offensive matter should be carried off in wheel-barrows,\n",
      "by two servants appointed for that purpose.  I would not have dwelt so\n",
      "long upon a circumstance that, perhaps, at first sight, may appear not\n",
      "very momentous, if I had not thought it necessary to justify my\n",
      "character, in point of cleanliness, to the world; which, I am told, some\n",
      "of my maligners have been pleased, upon this and other occasions, to call\n",
      "in question.\n",
      "\n",
      "When this adventure was at an end, I came back out of my house, having\n",
      "occasion for fresh air.  The emperor was already descended from the\n",
      "tower, and advancing on horseback towards me, which had like to have cost\n",
      "him dear; for the beast, though very well trained, yet wholly unused to\n",
      "such a sight, which appeared as if a mountain moved before him, reared up\n",
      "on its hinder feet: but that prince, who is an excellent horseman, kept\n",
      "his seat, till his attendants ran in, and held the bridle, while his\n",
      "majesty had time to dismount.  When he alighted, he surveyed me round\n",
      "with great admiration; but kept beyond the length of my chain.  He\n",
      "ordered his cooks and butlers, who were already prepared, to give me\n",
      "victuals and drink, which they pushed forward in a sort of vehicles upon\n",
      "wheels, till I could reach them.  I took these vehicles and soon emptied\n",
      "them all; twenty of them were filled with meat, and ten with liquor; each\n",
      "of the former afforded me two or three good mouthfuls; and I emptied the\n",
      "liquor of ten vessels, which was contained in earthen vials, into one\n",
      "vehicle, drinking it off at a draught; and so I did with the rest.  The\n",
      "empress, and young princes of the blood of both sexes, attended by many\n",
      "ladies, sat at some distance in their chairs; but upon the accident that\n",
      "happened to the emperor’s horse, they alighted, and came near his person,\n",
      "which I am now going to describe.  He is taller by almost the breadth of\n",
      "my nail, than any of his court; which alone is enough to strike an awe\n",
      "into the beholders.  His features are strong and masculine, with an\n",
      "Austrian lip and arched nose, his complexion olive, his countenance\n",
      "erect, his body and limbs well proportioned, all his motions graceful,\n",
      "and his deportment majestic.  He was then past his prime, being\n",
      "twenty-eight years and three quarters old, of which he had reigned about\n",
      "seven in great felicity, and generally victorious.  For the better\n",
      "convenience of beholding him, I lay on my side, so that my face was\n",
      "parallel to his, and he stood but three yards off: however, I have had\n",
      "him since many times in my hand, and therefore cannot be deceived in the\n",
      "description.  His dress was very plain and simple, and the fashion of it\n",
      "between the Asiatic and the European; but he had on his head a light\n",
      "helmet of gold, adorned with jewels, and a plume on the crest.  He held\n",
      "his sword drawn in his hand to defend himself, if I should happen to\n",
      "break loose; it was almost three inches long; the hilt and scabbard were\n",
      "gold enriched with diamonds.  His voice was shrill, but very clear and\n",
      "articulate; and I could distinctly hear it when I stood up.  The ladies\n",
      "and courtiers were all most magnificently clad; so that the spot they\n",
      "stood upon seemed to resemble a petticoat spread upon the ground,\n",
      "embroidered with figures of gold and silver.  His imperial majesty spoke\n",
      "often to me, and I returned answers: but neither of us could understand a\n",
      "syllable.  There were several of his priests and lawyers present (as I\n",
      "conjectured by their habits), who were commanded to address themselves to\n",
      "me; and I spoke to them in as many languages as I had the least\n",
      "smattering of, which were High and Low Dutch, Latin, French, Spanish,\n",
      "Italian, and Lingua Franca, but all to no purpose.  After about two hours\n",
      "the court retired, and I was left with a strong guard, to prevent the\n",
      "impertinence, and probably the malice of the rabble, who were very\n",
      "impatient to crowd about me as near as they durst; and some of them had\n",
      "the impudence to shoot their arrows at me, as I sat on the ground by the\n",
      "door of my house, whereof one very narrowly missed my left eye.  But the\n",
      "colonel ordered six of the ringleaders to be seized, and thought no\n",
      "punishment so proper as to deliver them bound into my hands; which some\n",
      "of his soldiers accordingly did, pushing them forward with the butt-ends\n",
      "of their pikes into my reach.  I took them all in my right hand, put five\n",
      "of them into my coat-pocket; and as to the sixth, I made a countenance as\n",
      "if I would eat him alive.  The poor man squalled terribly, and the\n",
      "colonel and his officers were in much pain, especially when they saw me\n",
      "take out my penknife: but I soon put them out of fear; for, looking\n",
      "mildly, and immediately cutting the strings he was bound with, I set him\n",
      "gently on the ground, and away he ran.  I treated the rest in the same\n",
      "manner, taking them one by one out of my pocket; and I observed both the\n",
      "soldiers and people were highly delighted at this mark of my clemency,\n",
      "which was represented very much to my advantage at court.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards night I got with some difficulty into my house, where I lay on\n",
      "the ground, and continued to do so about a fortnight; during which time,\n",
      "the emperor gave orders to have a bed prepared for me.  Six hundred beds\n",
      "of the common measure were brought in carriages, and worked up in my\n",
      "house; a hundred and fifty of their beds, sewn together, made up the\n",
      "breadth and length; and these were four double: which, however, kept me\n",
      "but very indifferently from the hardness of the floor, that was of smooth\n",
      "stone.  By the same computation, they provided me with sheets, blankets,\n",
      "and coverlets, tolerable enough for one who had been so long inured to\n",
      "hardships.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the news of my arrival spread through the kingdom, it brought\n",
      "prodigious numbers of rich, idle, and curious people to see me; so that\n",
      "the villages were almost emptied; and great neglect of tillage and\n",
      "household affairs must have ensued, if his imperial majesty had not\n",
      "provided, by several proclamations and orders of state, against this\n",
      "inconveniency.  He directed that those who had already beheld me should\n",
      "return home, and not presume to come within fifty yards of my house,\n",
      "without license from the court; whereby the secretaries of state got\n",
      "considerable fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the mean time the emperor held frequent councils, to debate what\n",
      "course should be taken with me; and I was afterwards assured by a\n",
      "particular friend, a person of great quality, who was as much in the\n",
      "secret as any, that the court was under many difficulties concerning me.\n",
      "They apprehended my breaking loose; that my diet would be very expensive,\n",
      "and might cause a famine.  Sometimes they determined to starve me; or at\n",
      "least to shoot me in the face and hands with poisoned arrows, which would\n",
      "soon despatch me; but again they considered, that the stench of so large\n",
      "a carcass might produce a plague in the metropolis, and probably spread\n",
      "through the whole kingdom.  In the midst of these consultations, several\n",
      "officers of the army went to the door of the great council-chamber, and\n",
      "two of them being admitted, gave an account of my behaviour to the six\n",
      "criminals above-mentioned; which made so favourable an impression in the\n",
      "breast of his majesty and the whole board, in my behalf, that an imperial\n",
      "commission was issued out, obliging all the villages, nine hundred yards\n",
      "round the city, to deliver in every morning six beeves, forty sheep, and\n",
      "other victuals for my sustenance; together with a proportionable quantity\n",
      "of bread, and wine, and other liquors; for the due payment of which, his\n",
      "majesty gave assignments upon his treasury:—for this prince lives chiefly\n",
      "upon his own demesnes; seldom, except upon great occasions, raising any\n",
      "subsidies upon his subjects, who are bound to attend him in his wars at\n",
      "their own expense.  An establishment was also made of six hundred persons\n",
      "to be my domestics, who had board-wages allowed for their maintenance,\n",
      "and tents built for them very conveniently on each side of my door.  It\n",
      "was likewise ordered, that three hundred tailors should make me a suit of\n",
      "clothes, after the fashion of the country; that six of his majesty’s\n",
      "greatest scholars should be employed to instruct me in their language;\n",
      "and lastly, that the emperor’s horses, and those of the nobility and\n",
      "troops of guards, should be frequently exercised in my sight, to accustom\n",
      "themselves to me.  All these orders were duly put in execution; and in\n",
      "about three weeks I made a great progress in learning their language;\n",
      "during which time the emperor frequently honoured me with his visits, and\n",
      "was pleased to assist my masters in teaching me.  We began already to\n",
      "converse together in some sort; and the first words I learnt, were to\n",
      "express my desire “that he would please give me my liberty;” which I\n",
      "every day repeated on my knees.  His answer, as I could comprehend it,\n",
      "was, “that this must be a work of time, not to be thought on without the\n",
      "advice of his council, and that first I must _lumos kelmin pesso desmar\n",
      "lon emposo_;” that is, swear a peace with him and his kingdom.  However,\n",
      "that I should be used with all kindness.  And he advised me to “acquire,\n",
      "by my patience and discreet behaviour, the good opinion of himself and\n",
      "his subjects.”  He desired “I would not take it ill, if he gave orders to\n",
      "certain proper officers to search me; for probably I might carry about me\n",
      "several weapons, which must needs be dangerous things, if they answered\n",
      "the bulk of so prodigious a person.”  I said, “His majesty should be\n",
      "satisfied; for I was ready to strip myself, and turn up my pockets before\n",
      "him.”  This I delivered part in words, and part in signs.  He replied,\n",
      "“that, by the laws of the kingdom, I must be searched by two of his\n",
      "officers; that he knew this could not be done without my consent and\n",
      "assistance; and he had so good an opinion of my generosity and justice,\n",
      "as to trust their persons in my hands; that whatever they took from me,\n",
      "should be returned when I left the country, or paid for at the rate which\n",
      "I would set upon them.”  I took up the two officers in my hands, put them\n",
      "first into my coat-pockets, and then into every other pocket about me,\n",
      "except my two fobs, and another secret pocket, which I had no mind should\n",
      "be searched, wherein I had some little necessaries that were of no\n",
      "consequence to any but myself.  In one of my fobs there was a silver\n",
      "watch, and in the other a small quantity of gold in a purse.  These\n",
      "gentlemen, having pen, ink, and paper, about them, made an exact\n",
      "inventory of every thing they saw; and when they had done, desired I\n",
      "would set them down, that they might deliver it to the emperor.  This\n",
      "inventory I afterwards translated into English, and is, word for word, as\n",
      "follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Imprimis_: In the right coat-pocket of the great man-mountain” (for\n",
      "so I interpret the words _quinbus flestrin_,) “after the strictest\n",
      "search, we found only one great piece of coarse-cloth, large enough\n",
      "to be a foot-cloth for your majesty’s chief room of state.  In the\n",
      "left pocket we saw a huge silver chest, with a cover of the same\n",
      "metal, which we, the searchers, were not able to lift.  We desired it\n",
      "should be opened, and one of us stepping into it, found himself up to\n",
      "the mid leg in a sort of dust, some part whereof flying up to our\n",
      "faces set us both a sneezing for several times together.  In his\n",
      "right waistcoat-pocket we found a prodigious bundle of white thin\n",
      "substances, folded one over another, about the bigness of three men,\n",
      "tied with a strong cable, and marked with black figures; which we\n",
      "humbly conceive to be writings, every letter almost half as large as\n",
      "the palm of our hands.  In the left there was a sort of engine, from\n",
      "the back of which were extended twenty long poles, resembling the\n",
      "pallisados before your majesty’s court: wherewith we conjecture the\n",
      "man-mountain combs his head; for we did not always trouble him with\n",
      "questions, because we found it a great difficulty to make him\n",
      "understand us.  In the large pocket, on the right side of his middle\n",
      "cover” (so I translate the word _ranfulo_, by which they meant my\n",
      "breeches,) “we saw a hollow pillar of iron, about the length of a\n",
      "man, fastened to a strong piece of timber larger than the pillar; and\n",
      "upon one side of the pillar, were huge pieces of iron sticking out,\n",
      "cut into strange figures, which we know not what to make of.  In the\n",
      "left pocket, another engine of the same kind.  In the smaller pocket\n",
      "on the right side, were several round flat pieces of white and red\n",
      "metal, of different bulk; some of the white, which seemed to be\n",
      "silver, were so large and heavy, that my comrade and I could hardly\n",
      "lift them.  In the left pocket were two black pillars irregularly\n",
      "shaped: we could not, without difficulty, reach the top of them, as\n",
      "we stood at the bottom of his pocket.  One of them was covered, and\n",
      "seemed all of a piece: but at the upper end of the other there\n",
      "appeared a white round substance, about twice the bigness of our\n",
      "heads.  Within each of these was enclosed a prodigious plate of\n",
      "steel; which, by our orders, we obliged him to show us, because we\n",
      "apprehended they might be dangerous engines.  He took them out of\n",
      "their cases, and told us, that in his own country his practice was to\n",
      "shave his beard with one of these, and cut his meat with the other.\n",
      "There were two pockets which we could not enter: these he called his\n",
      "fobs; they were two large slits cut into the top of his middle cover,\n",
      "but squeezed close by the pressure of his belly.  Out of the right\n",
      "fob hung a great silver chain, with a wonderful kind of engine at the\n",
      "bottom.  We directed him to draw out whatever was at the end of that\n",
      "chain; which appeared to be a globe, half silver, and half of some\n",
      "transparent metal; for, on the transparent side, we saw certain\n",
      "strange figures circularly drawn, and thought we could touch them,\n",
      "till we found our fingers stopped by the lucid substance.  He put\n",
      "this engine into our ears, which made an incessant noise, like that\n",
      "of a water-mill: and we conjecture it is either some unknown animal,\n",
      "or the god that he worships; but we are more inclined to the latter\n",
      "opinion, because he assured us, (if we understood him right, for he\n",
      "expressed himself very imperfectly) that he seldom did any thing\n",
      "without consulting it.  He called it his oracle, and said, it pointed\n",
      "out the time for every action of his life.  From the left fob he took\n",
      "out a net almost large enough for a fisherman, but contrived to open\n",
      "and shut like a purse, and served him for the same use: we found\n",
      "therein several massy pieces of yellow metal, which, if they be real\n",
      "gold, must be of immense value.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Having thus, in obedience to your majesty’s commands, diligently\n",
      "searched all his pockets, we observed a girdle about his waist made\n",
      "of the hide of some prodigious animal, from which, on the left side,\n",
      "hung a sword of the length of five men; and on the right, a bag or\n",
      "pouch divided into two cells, each cell capable of holding three of\n",
      "your majesty’s subjects.  In one of these cells were several globes,\n",
      "or balls, of a most ponderous metal, about the bigness of our heads,\n",
      "and requiring a strong hand to lift them: the other cell contained a\n",
      "heap of certain black grains, but of no great bulk or weight, for we\n",
      "could hold above fifty of them in the palms of our hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is an exact inventory of what we found about the body of the\n",
      "man-mountain, who used us with great civility, and due respect to\n",
      "your majesty’s commission.  Signed and sealed on the fourth day of\n",
      "the eighty-ninth moon of your majesty’s auspicious reign.\n",
      "\n",
      "CLEFRIN FRELOCK, MARSI FRELOCK.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When this inventory was read over to the emperor, he directed me,\n",
      "although in very gentle terms, to deliver up the several particulars.  He\n",
      "first called for my scimitar, which I took out, scabbard and all.  In the\n",
      "mean time he ordered three thousand of his choicest troops (who then\n",
      "attended him) to surround me at a distance, with their bows and arrows\n",
      "just ready to discharge; but I did not observe it, for mine eyes were\n",
      "wholly fixed upon his majesty.  He then desired me to draw my scimitar,\n",
      "which, although it had got some rust by the sea water, was, in most\n",
      "parts, exceeding bright.  I did so, and immediately all the troops gave a\n",
      "shout between terror and surprise; for the sun shone clear, and the\n",
      "reflection dazzled their eyes, as I waved the scimitar to and fro in my\n",
      "hand.  His majesty, who is a most magnanimous prince, was less daunted\n",
      "than I could expect: he ordered me to return it into the scabbard, and\n",
      "cast it on the ground as gently as I could, about six feet from the end\n",
      "of my chain.  The next thing he demanded was one of the hollow iron\n",
      "pillars; by which he meant my pocket pistols.  I drew it out, and at his\n",
      "desire, as well as I could, expressed to him the use of it; and charging\n",
      "it only with powder, which, by the closeness of my pouch, happened to\n",
      "escape wetting in the sea (an inconvenience against which all prudent\n",
      "mariners take special care to provide,) I first cautioned the emperor not\n",
      "to be afraid, and then I let it off in the air.  The astonishment here\n",
      "was much greater than at the sight of my scimitar.  Hundreds fell down as\n",
      "if they had been struck dead; and even the emperor, although he stood his\n",
      "ground, could not recover himself for some time.  I delivered up both my\n",
      "pistols in the same manner as I had done my scimitar, and then my pouch\n",
      "of powder and bullets; begging him that the former might be kept from\n",
      "fire, for it would kindle with the smallest spark, and blow up his\n",
      "imperial palace into the air.  I likewise delivered up my watch, which\n",
      "the emperor was very curious to see, and commanded two of his tallest\n",
      "yeomen of the guards to bear it on a pole upon their shoulders, as\n",
      "draymen in England do a barrel of ale.  He was amazed at the continual\n",
      "noise it made, and the motion of the minute-hand, which he could easily\n",
      "discern; for their sight is much more acute than ours: he asked the\n",
      "opinions of his learned men about it, which were various and remote, as\n",
      "the reader may well imagine without my repeating; although indeed I could\n",
      "not very perfectly understand them.  I then gave up my silver and copper\n",
      "money, my purse, with nine large pieces of gold, and some smaller ones;\n",
      "my knife and razor, my comb and silver snuff-box, my handkerchief and\n",
      "journal-book.  My scimitar, pistols, and pouch, were conveyed in\n",
      "carriages to his majesty’s stores; but the rest of my goods were returned\n",
      "me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had as I before observed, one private pocket, which escaped their\n",
      "search, wherein there was a pair of spectacles (which I sometimes use for\n",
      "the weakness of mine eyes,) a pocket perspective, and some other little\n",
      "conveniences; which, being of no consequence to the emperor, I did not\n",
      "think myself bound in honour to discover, and I apprehended they might be\n",
      "lost or spoiled if I ventured them out of my possession.\n",

      "CHAPTER III.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The author diverts the emperor, and his nobility of both sexes, in a very\n",
      "uncommon manner.  The diversions of the court of Lilliput described.  The\n",
      "author has his liberty granted him upon certain conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "My gentleness and good behaviour had gained so far on the emperor and his\n",
      "court, and indeed upon the army and people in general, that I began to\n",
      "conceive hopes of getting my liberty in a short time.  I took all\n",
      "possible methods to cultivate this favourable disposition.  The natives\n",
      "came, by degrees, to be less apprehensive of any danger from me.  I would\n",
      "sometimes lie down, and let five or six of them dance on my hand; and at\n",
      "last the boys and girls would venture to come and play at hide-and-seek\n",
      "in my hair.  I had now made a good progress in understanding and speaking\n",
      "the language.  The emperor had a mind one day to entertain me with\n",
      "several of the country shows, wherein they exceed all nations I have\n",
      "known, both for dexterity and magnificence.  I was diverted with none so\n",
      "much as that of the rope-dancers, performed upon a slender white thread,\n",
      "extended about two feet, and twelve inches from the ground.  Upon which I\n",
      "shall desire liberty, with the reader’s patience, to enlarge a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "This diversion is only practised by those persons who are candidates for\n",
      "great employments, and high favour at court.  They are trained in this\n",
      "art from their youth, and are not always of noble birth, or liberal\n",
      "education.  When a great office is vacant, either by death or disgrace\n",
      "(which often happens,) five or six of those candidates petition the\n",
      "emperor to entertain his majesty and the court with a dance on the rope;\n",
      "and whoever jumps the highest, without falling, succeeds in the office.\n",
      "Very often the chief ministers themselves are commanded to show their\n",
      "skill, and to convince the emperor that they have not lost their faculty.\n",
      "Flimnap, the treasurer, is allowed to cut a caper on the straight rope,\n",
      "at least an inch higher than any other lord in the whole empire.  I have\n",
      "seen him do the summerset several times together, upon a trencher fixed\n",
      "on a rope which is no thicker than a common packthread in England.  My\n",
      "friend Reldresal, principal secretary for private affairs, is, in my\n",
      "opinion, if I am not partial, the second after the treasurer; the rest of\n",
      "the great officers are much upon a par.\n",
      "\n",
      "These diversions are often attended with fatal accidents, whereof great\n",
      "numbers are on record.  I myself have seen two or three candidates break\n",
      "a limb.  But the danger is much greater, when the ministers themselves\n",
      "are commanded to show their dexterity; for, by contending to excel\n",
      "themselves and their fellows, they strain so far that there is hardly one\n",
      "of them who has not received a fall, and some of them two or three.  I\n",
      "was assured that, a year or two before my arrival, Flimnap would\n",
      "infallibly have broke his neck, if one of the king’s cushions, that\n",
      "accidentally lay on the ground, had not weakened the force of his fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is likewise another diversion, which is only shown before the\n",
      "emperor and empress, and first minister, upon particular occasions.  The\n",
      "emperor lays on the table three fine silken threads of six inches long;\n",
      "one is blue, the other red, and the third green.  These threads are\n",
      "proposed as prizes for those persons whom the emperor has a mind to\n",
      "distinguish by a peculiar mark of his favour.  The ceremony is performed\n",
      "in his majesty’s great chamber of state, where the candidates are to\n",
      "undergo a trial of dexterity very different from the former, and such as\n",
      "I have not observed the least resemblance of in any other country of the\n",
      "new or old world.  The emperor holds a stick in his hands, both ends\n",
      "parallel to the horizon, while the candidates advancing, one by one,\n",
      "sometimes leap over the stick, sometimes creep under it, backward and\n",
      "forward, several times, according as the stick is advanced or depressed.\n",
      "Sometimes the emperor holds one end of the stick, and his first minister\n",
      "the other; sometimes the minister has it entirely to himself.  Whoever\n",
      "performs his part with most agility, and holds out the longest in leaping\n",
      "and creeping, is rewarded with the blue-coloured silk; the red is given\n",
      "to the next, and the green to the third, which they all wear girt twice\n",
      "round about the middle; and you see few great persons about this court\n",
      "who are not adorned with one of these girdles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The horses of the army, and those of the royal stables, having been daily\n",
      "led before me, were no longer shy, but would come up to my very feet\n",
      "without starting.  The riders would leap them over my hand, as I held it\n",
      "on the ground; and one of the emperor’s huntsmen, upon a large courser,\n",
      "took my foot, shoe and all; which was indeed a prodigious leap.  I had\n",
      "the good fortune to divert the emperor one day after a very extraordinary\n",
      "manner.  I desired he would order several sticks of two feet high, and\n",
      "the thickness of an ordinary cane, to be brought me; whereupon his\n",
      "majesty commanded the master of his woods to give directions accordingly;\n",
      "and the next morning six woodmen arrived with as many carriages, drawn by\n",
      "eight horses to each.  I took nine of these sticks, and fixing them\n",
      "firmly in the ground in a quadrangular figure, two feet and a half\n",
      "square, I took four other sticks, and tied them parallel at each corner,\n",
      "about two feet from the ground; then I fastened my handkerchief to the\n",
      "nine sticks that stood erect; and extended it on all sides, till it was\n",
      "tight as the top of a drum; and the four parallel sticks, rising about\n",
      "five inches higher than the handkerchief, served as ledges on each side.\n",
      "When I had finished my work, I desired the emperor to let a troop of his\n",
      "best horses twenty-four in number, come and exercise upon this plain.\n",
      "His majesty approved of the proposal, and I took them up, one by one, in\n",
      "my hands, ready mounted and armed, with the proper officers to exercise\n",
      "them.  As soon as they got into order they divided into two parties,\n",
      "performed mock skirmishes, discharged blunt arrows, drew their swords,\n",
      "fled and pursued, attacked and retired, and in short discovered the best\n",
      "military discipline I ever beheld.  The parallel sticks secured them and\n",
      "their horses from falling over the stage; and the emperor was so much\n",
      "delighted, that he ordered this entertainment to be repeated several\n",
      "days, and once was pleased to be lifted up and give the word of command;\n",
      "and with great difficulty persuaded even the empress herself to let me\n",
      "hold her in her close chair within two yards of the stage, when she was\n",
      "able to take a full view of the whole performance.  It was my good\n",
      "fortune, that no ill accident happened in these entertainments; only once\n",
      "a fiery horse, that belonged to one of the captains, pawing with his\n",
      "hoof, struck a hole in my handkerchief, and his foot slipping, he\n",
      "overthrew his rider and himself; but I immediately relieved them both,\n",
      "and covering the hole with one hand, I set down the troop with the other,\n",
      "in the same manner as I took them up. The horse that fell was strained in\n",
      "the left shoulder, but the rider got no hurt; and I repaired my\n",
      "handkerchief as well as I could: however, I would not trust to the\n",
      "strength of it any more, in such dangerous enterprises.\n",
      "\n",
      "About two or three days before I was set at liberty, as I was\n",
      "entertaining the court with this kind of feat, there arrived an express\n",
      "to inform his majesty, that some of his subjects, riding near the place\n",
      "where I was first taken up, had seen a great black substance lying on the\n",
      "around, very oddly shaped, extending its edges round, as wide as his\n",
      "majesty’s bedchamber, and rising up in the middle as high as a man; that\n",
      "it was no living creature, as they at first apprehended, for it lay on\n",
      "the grass without motion; and some of them had walked round it several\n",
      "times; that, by mounting upon each other’s shoulders, they had got to the\n",
      "top, which was flat and even, and, stamping upon it, they found that it\n",
      "was hollow within; that they humbly conceived it might be something\n",
      "belonging to the man-mountain; and if his majesty pleased, they would\n",
      "undertake to bring it with only five horses.  I presently knew what they\n",
      "meant, and was glad at heart to receive this intelligence.  It seems,\n",
      "upon my first reaching the shore after our shipwreck, I was in such\n",
      "confusion, that before I came to the place where I went to sleep, my hat,\n",
      "which I had fastened with a string to my head while I was rowing, and had\n",
      "stuck on all the time I was swimming, fell off after I came to land; the\n",
      "string, as I conjecture, breaking by some accident, which I never\n",
      "observed, but thought my hat had been lost at sea.  I entreated his\n",
      "imperial majesty to give orders it might be brought to me as soon as\n",
      "possible, describing to him the use and the nature of it: and the next\n",
      "day the waggoners arrived with it, but not in a very good condition; they\n",
      "had bored two holes in the brim, within an inch and half of the edge, and\n",
      "fastened two hooks in the holes; these hooks were tied by a long cord to\n",
      "the harness, and thus my hat was dragged along for above half an English\n",
      "mile; but, the ground in that country being extremely smooth and level,\n",
      "it received less damage than I expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two days after this adventure, the emperor, having ordered that part of\n",
      "his army which quarters in and about his metropolis, to be in readiness,\n",
      "took a fancy of diverting himself in a very singular manner.  He desired\n",
      "I would stand like a Colossus, with my legs as far asunder as I\n",
      "conveniently could.  He then commanded his general (who was an old\n",
      "experienced leader, and a great patron of mine) to draw up the troops in\n",
      "close order, and march them under me; the foot by twenty-four abreast,\n",
      "and the horse by sixteen, with drums beating, colours flying, and pikes\n",
      "advanced.  This body consisted of three thousand foot, and a thousand\n",
      "horse.  His majesty gave orders, upon pain of death, that every soldier\n",
      "in his march should observe the strictest decency with regard to my\n",
      "person; which however could not prevent some of the younger officers from\n",
      "turning up their eyes as they passed under me: and, to confess the truth,\n",
      "my breeches were at that time in so ill a condition, that they afforded\n",
      "some opportunities for laughter and admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had sent so many memorials and petitions for my liberty, that his\n",
      "majesty at length mentioned the matter, first in the cabinet, and then in\n",
      "a full council; where it was opposed by none, except Skyresh Bolgolam,\n",
      "who was pleased, without any provocation, to be my mortal enemy.  But it\n",
      "was carried against him by the whole board, and confirmed by the emperor.\n",
      "That minister was _galbet_, or admiral of the realm, very much in his\n",
      "master’s confidence, and a person well versed in affairs, but of a morose\n",
      "and sour complexion.  However, he was at length persuaded to comply; but\n",
      "prevailed that the articles and conditions upon which I should be set\n",
      "free, and to which I must swear, should be drawn up by himself.  These\n",
      "articles were brought to me by Skyresh Bolgolam in person attended by two\n",
      "under-secretaries, and several persons of distinction.  After they were\n",
      "read, I was demanded to swear to the performance of them; first in the\n",
      "manner of my own country, and afterwards in the method prescribed by\n",
      "their laws; which was, to hold my right foot in my left hand, and to\n",
      "place the middle finger of my right hand on the crown of my head, and my\n",
      "thumb on the tip of my right ear.  But because the reader may be curious\n",
      "to have some idea of the style and manner of expression peculiar to that\n",

      "emperor’s palace.  A conversation between the author and a principal\n",
      "secretary, concerning the affairs of that empire.  The author’s offers to\n",
      "serve the emperor in his wars.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first request I made, after I had obtained my liberty, was, that I\n",
      "might have license to see Mildendo, the metropolis; which the emperor\n",
      "easily granted me, but with a special charge to do no hurt either to the\n",
      "inhabitants or their houses.  The people had notice, by proclamation, of\n",
      "my design to visit the town.  The wall which encompassed it is two feet\n",
      "and a half high, and at least eleven inches broad, so that a coach and\n",
      "horses may be driven very safely round it; and it is flanked with strong\n",
      "towers at ten feet distance.  I stepped over the great western gate, and\n",
      "passed very gently, and sidling, through the two principal streets, only\n",
      "in my short waistcoat, for fear of damaging the roofs and eaves of the\n",
      "houses with the skirts of my coat.  I walked with the utmost\n",
      "circumspection, to avoid treading on any stragglers who might remain in\n",
      "the streets, although the orders were very strict, that all people should\n",
      "keep in their houses, at their own peril.  The garret windows and tops of\n",
      "houses were so crowded with spectators, that I thought in all my travels\n",
      "I had not seen a more populous place.  The city is an exact square, each\n",
      "side of the wall being five hundred feet long.  The two great streets,\n",
      "which run across and divide it into four quarters, are five feet wide.\n",
      "The lanes and alleys, which I could not enter, but only view them as I\n",
      "passed, are from twelve to eighteen inches.  The town is capable of\n",
      "holding five hundred thousand souls: the houses are from three to five\n",
      "stories: the shops and markets well provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "The emperor’s palace is in the centre of the city where the two great\n",
      "streets meet.  It is enclosed by a wall of two feet high, and twenty feet\n",
      "distance from the buildings.  I had his majesty’s permission to step over\n",
      "this wall; and, the space being so wide between that and the palace, I\n",
      "could easily view it on every side.  The outward court is a square of\n",
      "forty feet, and includes two other courts: in the inmost are the royal\n",
      "apartments, which I was very desirous to see, but found it extremely\n",
      "difficult; for the great gates, from one square into another, were but\n",
      "eighteen inches high, and seven inches wide.  Now the buildings of the\n",
      "outer court were at least five feet high, and it was impossible for me to\n",
      "stride over them without infinite damage to the pile, though the walls\n",
      "were strongly built of hewn stone, and four inches thick.  At the same\n",
      "time the emperor had a great desire that I should see the magnificence of\n",
      "his palace; but this I was not able to do till three days after, which I\n",
      "spent in cutting down with my knife some of the largest trees in the\n",
      "royal park, about a hundred yards distant from the city.  Of these trees\n",
      "I made two stools, each about three feet high, and strong enough to bear\n",
      "my weight.  The people having received notice a second time, I went again\n",
      "through the city to the palace with my two stools in my hands.  When I\n",
      "came to the side of the outer court, I stood upon one stool, and took the\n",
      "other in my hand; this I lifted over the roof, and gently set it down on\n",
      "the space between the first and second court, which was eight feet wide.\n",
      "I then stept over the building very conveniently from one stool to the\n",
      "other, and drew up the first after me with a hooked stick.  By this\n",
      "contrivance I got into the inmost court; and, lying down upon my side, I\n",
      "applied my face to the windows of the middle stories, which were left\n",
      "open on purpose, and discovered the most splendid apartments that can be\n",
      "imagined.  There I saw the empress and the young princes, in their\n",
      "several lodgings, with their chief attendants about them.  Her imperial\n",
      "majesty was pleased to smile very graciously upon me, and gave me out of\n",
      "the window her hand to kiss.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I shall not anticipate the reader with further descriptions of this\n",
      "kind, because I reserve them for a greater work, which is now almost\n",
      "ready for the press; containing a general description of this empire,\n",
      "from its first erection, through along series of princes; with a\n",
      "particular account of their wars and politics, laws, learning, and\n",
      "religion; their plants and animals; their peculiar manners and customs,\n",
      "with other matters very curious and useful; my chief design at present\n",
      "being only to relate such events and transactions as happened to the\n",
      "public or to myself during a residence of about nine months in that\n",
      "empire.\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning, about a fortnight after I had obtained my liberty,\n",
      "Reldresal, principal secretary (as they style him) for private affairs,\n",
      "came to my house attended only by one servant.  He ordered his coach to\n",
      "wait at a distance, and desired I would give him an hours audience; which\n",
      "I readily consented to, on account of his quality and personal merits, as\n",
      "well as of the many good offices he had done me during my solicitations\n",
      "at court.  I offered to lie down that he might the more conveniently\n",
      "reach my ear, but he chose rather to let me hold him in my hand during\n",
      "our conversation.  He began with compliments on my liberty; said “he\n",
      "might pretend to some merit in it;” but, however, added, “that if it had\n",
      "not been for the present situation of things at court, perhaps I might\n",
      "not have obtained it so soon.  For,” said he, “as flourishing a condition\n",
      "as we may appear to be in to foreigners, we labour under two mighty\n",
      "evils: a violent faction at home, and the danger of an invasion, by a\n",
      "most potent enemy, from abroad.  As to the first, you are to understand,\n",
      "that for about seventy moons past there have been two struggling parties\n",
      "in this empire, under the names of _Tramecksan_ and _Slamecksan_, from\n",
      "the high and low heels of their shoes, by which they distinguish\n",
      "themselves.  It is alleged, indeed, that the high heels are most\n",
      "agreeable to our ancient constitution; but, however this be, his majesty\n",
      "has determined to make use only of low heels in the administration of the\n",
      "government, and all offices in the gift of the crown, as you cannot but\n",
      "observe; and particularly that his majesty’s imperial heels are lower at\n",
      "least by a _drurr_ than any of his court (_drurr_ is a measure about the\n",
      "fourteenth part of an inch).  The animosities between these two parties\n",
      "run so high, that they will neither eat, nor drink, nor talk with each\n",
      "other.  We compute the _Tramecksan_, or high heels, to exceed us in\n",
      "number; but the power is wholly on our side.  We apprehend his imperial\n",
      "highness, the heir to the crown, to have some tendency towards the high\n",
      "heels; at least we can plainly discover that one of his heels is higher\n",
      "than the other, which gives him a hobble in his gait.  Now, in the midst\n",
      "of these intestine disquiets, we are threatened with an invasion from the\n",
      "island of Blefuscu, which is the other great empire of the universe,\n",
      "almost as large and powerful as this of his majesty.  For as to what we\n",
      "have heard you affirm, that there are other kingdoms and states in the\n",
      "world inhabited by human creatures as large as yourself, our philosophers\n",
      "are in much doubt, and would rather conjecture that you dropped from the\n",
      "moon, or one of the stars; because it is certain, that a hundred mortals\n",
      "of your bulk would in a short time destroy all the fruits and cattle of\n",
      "his majesty’s dominions: besides, our histories of six thousand moons\n",
      "make no mention of any other regions than the two great empires of\n",
      "Lilliput and Blefuscu.  Which two mighty powers have, as I was going to\n",
      "tell you, been engaged in a most obstinate war for six-and-thirty moons\n",
      "past.  It began upon the following occasion.  It is allowed on all hands,\n",
      "that the primitive way of breaking eggs, before we eat them, was upon the\n",
      "larger end; but his present majesty’s grandfather, while he was a boy,\n",
      "going to eat an egg, and breaking it according to the ancient practice,\n",
      "happened to cut one of his fingers.  Whereupon the emperor his father\n",
      "published an edict, commanding all his subjects, upon great penalties, to\n",
      "break the smaller end of their eggs.  The people so highly resented this\n",
      "law, that our histories tell us, there have been six rebellions raised on\n",
      "that account; wherein one emperor lost his life, and another his crown.\n",
      "These civil commotions were constantly fomented by the monarchs of\n",
      "Blefuscu; and when they were quelled, the exiles always fled for refuge\n",

      "several times suffered death, rather than submit to break their eggs at\n",
      "the smaller end.  Many hundred large volumes have been published upon\n",
      "this controversy: but the books of the Big-endians have been long\n",
      "forbidden, and the whole party rendered incapable by law of holding\n",
      "employments.  During the course of these troubles, the emperors of\n",
      "Blefusca did frequently expostulate by their ambassadors, accusing us of\n",
      "making a schism in religion, by offending against a fundamental doctrine\n",
      "of our great prophet Lustrog, in the fifty-fourth chapter of the\n",
      "Blundecral (which is their Alcoran).  This, however, is thought to be a\n",
      "mere strain upon the text; for the words are these: ‘that all true\n",
      "believers break their eggs at the convenient end.’  And which is the\n",
      "convenient end, seems, in my humble opinion to be left to every man’s\n",
      "conscience, or at least in the power of the chief magistrate to\n",
      "determine.  Now, the Big-endian exiles have found so much credit in the\n",
      "emperor of Blefuscu’s court, and so much private assistance and\n",
      "encouragement from their party here at home, that a bloody war has been\n",
      "carried on between the two empires for six-and-thirty moons, with various\n",
      "success; during which time we have lost forty capital ships, and a much a\n",
      "greater number of smaller vessels, together with thirty thousand of our\n",
      "best seamen and soldiers; and the damage received by the enemy is\n",
      "reckoned to be somewhat greater than ours.  However, they have now\n",
      "equipped a numerous fleet, and are just preparing to make a descent upon\n",
      "us; and his imperial majesty, placing great confidence in your valour and\n",
      "strength, has commanded me to lay this account of his affairs before\n",
      "you.”\n",

      "The author, by an extraordinary stratagem, prevents an invasion.  A high\n",
      "title of honour is conferred upon him.  Ambassadors arrive from the\n",
      "emperor of Blefuscu, and sue for peace.  The empress’s apartment on fire\n",
      "by an accident; the author instrumental in saving the rest of the palace.\n",
      "\n",
      "The empire of Blefuscu is an island situated to the north-east of\n",
      "Lilliput, from which it is parted only by a channel of eight hundred\n",
      "yards wide.  I had not yet seen it, and upon this notice of an intended\n",
      "invasion, I avoided appearing on that side of the coast, for fear of\n",
      "being discovered, by some of the enemy’s ships, who had received no\n",
      "intelligence of me; all intercourse between the two empires having been\n",
      "strictly forbidden during the war, upon pain of death, and an embargo\n",
      "laid by our emperor upon all vessels whatsoever.  I communicated to his\n",
      "majesty a project I had formed of seizing the enemy’s whole fleet; which,\n",
      "as our scouts assured us, lay at anchor in the harbour, ready to sail\n",
      "with the first fair wind.  I consulted the most experienced seamen upon\n",
      "the depth of the channel, which they had often plumbed; who told me, that\n",
      "in the middle, at high-water, it was seventy _glumgluffs_ deep, which is\n",
      "about six feet of European measure; and the rest of it fifty _glumgluffs_\n",
      "at most.  I walked towards the north-east coast, over against Blefuscu,\n",
      "where, lying down behind a hillock, I took out my small perspective\n",
      "glass, and viewed the enemy’s fleet at anchor, consisting of about fifty\n",
      "men of war, and a great number of transports: I then came back to my\n",
      "house, and gave orders (for which I had a warrant) for a great quantity\n",
      "of the strongest cable and bars of iron.  The cable was about as thick as\n",
      "packthread and the bars of the length and size of a knitting-needle.  I\n",
      "trebled the cable to make it stronger, and for the same reason I twisted\n",
      "three of the iron bars together, bending the extremities into a hook.\n",
      "Having thus fixed fifty hooks to as many cables, I went back to the\n",
      "north-east coast, and putting off my coat, shoes, and stockings, walked\n",
      "into the sea, in my leathern jerkin, about half an hour before high\n",
      "water.  I waded with what haste I could, and swam in the middle about\n",
      "thirty yards, till I felt ground.  I arrived at the fleet in less than\n",
      "half an hour.  The enemy was so frightened when they saw me, that they\n",
      "leaped out of their ships, and swam to shore, where there could not be\n",
      "fewer than thirty thousand souls.  I then took my tackling, and,\n",
      "fastening a hook to the hole at the prow of each, I tied all the cords\n",
      "together at the end.  While I was thus employed, the enemy discharged\n",
      "several thousand arrows, many of which stuck in my hands and face, and,\n",
      "beside the excessive smart, gave me much disturbance in my work.  My\n",
      "greatest apprehension was for mine eyes, which I should have infallibly\n",
      "lost, if I had not suddenly thought of an expedient.  I kept, among other\n",
      "little necessaries, a pair of spectacles in a private pocket, which, as I\n",
      "observed before, had escaped the emperor’s searchers.  These I took out\n",
      "and fastened as strongly as I could upon my nose, and thus armed, went on\n",
      "boldly with my work, in spite of the enemy’s arrows, many of which struck\n",
      "against the glasses of my spectacles, but without any other effect,\n",
      "further than a little to discompose them.  I had now fastened all the\n",
      "hooks, and, taking the knot in my hand, began to pull; but not a ship\n",
      "would stir, for they were all too fast held by their anchors, so that the\n",
      "boldest part of my enterprise remained.  I therefore let go the cord, and\n",
      "leaving the looks fixed to the ships, I resolutely cut with my knife the\n",
      "cables that fastened the anchors, receiving about two hundred shots in my\n",
      "face and hands; then I took up the knotted end of the cables, to which my\n",
      "hooks were tied, and with great ease drew fifty of the enemy’s largest\n",
      "men of war after me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Blefuscudians, who had not the least imagination of what I intended,\n",
      "were at first confounded with astonishment.  They had seen me cut the\n",
      "cables, and thought my design was only to let the ships run adrift or\n",
      "fall foul on each other: but when they perceived the whole fleet moving\n",
      "in order, and saw me pulling at the end, they set up such a scream of\n",
      "grief and despair as it is almost impossible to describe or conceive.\n",
      "When I had got out of danger, I stopped awhile to pick out the arrows\n",
      "that stuck in my hands and face; and rubbed on some of the same ointment\n",
      "that was given me at my first arrival, as I have formerly mentioned.  I\n",
      "then took off my spectacles, and waiting about an hour, till the tide was\n",
      "a little fallen, I waded through the middle with my cargo, and arrived\n",
      "safe at the royal port of Lilliput.\n",
      "\n",
      "The emperor and his whole court stood on the shore, expecting the issue\n",
      "of this great adventure.  They saw the ships move forward in a large\n",
      "half-moon, but could not discern me, who was up to my breast in water.\n",
      "When I advanced to the middle of the channel, they were yet more in pain,\n",
      "because I was under water to my neck.  The emperor concluded me to be\n",
      "drowned, and that the enemy’s fleet was approaching in a hostile manner:\n",
      "but he was soon eased of his fears; for the channel growing shallower\n",
      "every step I made, I came in a short time within hearing, and holding up\n",
      "the end of the cable, by which the fleet was fastened, I cried in a loud\n",
      "voice, “Long live the most puissant king of Lilliput!”  This great prince\n",
      "received me at my landing with all possible encomiums, and created me a\n",
      "_nardac_ upon the spot, which is the highest title of honour among them.\n",
      "\n",
      "His majesty desired I would take some other opportunity of bringing all\n",
      "the rest of his enemy’s ships into his ports.  And so unmeasureable is\n",
      "the ambition of princes, that he seemed to think of nothing less than\n",
      "reducing the whole empire of Blefuscu into a province, and governing it,\n",
      "by a viceroy; of destroying the Big-endian exiles, and compelling that\n",
      "people to break the smaller end of their eggs, by which he would remain\n",
      "the sole monarch of the whole world.  But I endeavoured to divert him\n",
      "from this design, by many arguments drawn from the topics of policy as\n",
      "well as justice; and I plainly protested, “that I would never be an\n",
      "instrument of bringing a free and brave people into slavery.”  And, when\n",
      "the matter was debated in council, the wisest part of the ministry were\n",
      "of my opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "This open bold declaration of mine was so opposite to the schemes and\n",
      "politics of his imperial majesty, that he could never forgive me.  He\n",
      "mentioned it in a very artful manner at council, where I was told that\n",
      "some of the wisest appeared, at least by their silence, to be of my\n",
      "opinion; but others, who were my secret enemies, could not forbear some\n",
      "expressions which, by a side-wind, reflected on me.  And from this time\n",
      "began an intrigue between his majesty and a junto of ministers,\n",
      "maliciously bent against me, which broke out in less than two months, and\n",
      "had like to have ended in my utter destruction.  Of so little weight are\n",
      "the greatest services to princes, when put into the balance with a\n",
      "refusal to gratify their passions.\n",
      "\n",
      "About three weeks after this exploit, there arrived a solemn embassy from\n",
      "Blefuscu, with humble offers of a peace, which was soon concluded, upon\n",
      "conditions very advantageous to our emperor, wherewith I shall not\n",
      "trouble the reader.  There were six ambassadors, with a train of about\n",
      "five hundred persons, and their entry was very magnificent, suitable to\n",
      "the grandeur of their master, and the importance of their business.  When\n",
      "their treaty was finished, wherein I did them several good offices by the\n",
      "credit I now had, or at least appeared to have, at court, their\n",
      "excellencies, who were privately told how much I had been their friend,\n",
      "made me a visit in form.  They began with many compliments upon my valour\n",
      "and generosity, invited me to that kingdom in the emperor their master’s\n",
      "name, and desired me to show them some proofs of my prodigious strength,\n",
      "of which they had heard so many wonders; wherein I readily obliged them,\n",
      "but shall not trouble the reader with the particulars.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I had for some time entertained their excellencies, to their\n",
      "infinite satisfaction and surprise, I desired they would do me the honour\n",
      "to present my most humble respects to the emperor their master, the\n",
      "renown of whose virtues had so justly filled the whole world with\n",
      "admiration, and whose royal person I resolved to attend, before I\n",
      "returned to my own country.  Accordingly, the next time I had the honour\n",
      "to see our emperor, I desired his general license to wait on the\n",
      "Blefuscudian monarch, which he was pleased to grant me, as I could\n",
      "perceive, in a very cold manner; but could not guess the reason, till I\n",
      "had a whisper from a certain person, “that Flimnap and Bolgolam had\n",
      "represented my intercourse with those ambassadors as a mark of\n",
      "disaffection;” from which I am sure my heart was wholly free.  And this\n",
      "was the first time I began to conceive some imperfect idea of courts and\n",
      "ministers.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is to be observed, that these ambassadors spoke to me, by an\n",
      "interpreter, the languages of both empires differing as much from each\n",
      "other as any two in Europe, and each nation priding itself upon the\n",
      "antiquity, beauty, and energy of their own tongue, with an avowed\n",
      "contempt for that of their neighbour; yet our emperor, standing upon the\n",
      "advantage he had got by the seizure of their fleet, obliged them to\n",
      "deliver their credentials, and make their speech, in the Lilliputian\n",
      "tongue.  And it must be confessed, that from the great intercourse of\n",
      "trade and commerce between both realms, from the continual reception of\n",
      "exiles which is mutual among them, and from the custom, in each empire,\n",
      "to send their young nobility and richer gentry to the other, in order to\n",
      "polish themselves by seeing the world, and understanding men and manners;\n",
      "there are few persons of distinction, or merchants, or seamen, who dwell\n",
      "in the maritime parts, but what can hold conversation in both tongues; as\n",
      "I found some weeks after, when I went to pay my respects to the emperor\n",
      "of Blefuscu, which, in the midst of great misfortunes, through the malice\n",
      "of my enemies, proved a very happy adventure to me, as I shall relate in\n",
      "its proper place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reader may remember, that when I signed those articles upon which I\n",
      "recovered my liberty, there were some which I disliked, upon account of\n",
      "their being too servile; neither could anything but an extreme necessity\n",
      "have forced me to submit.  But being now a _nardac_ of the highest rank\n",
      "in that empire, such offices were looked upon as below my dignity, and\n",
      "the emperor (to do him justice), never once mentioned them to me.\n",
      "However, it was not long before I had an opportunity of doing his\n",
      "majesty, at least as I then thought, a most signal service.  I was\n",
      "alarmed at midnight with the cries of many hundred people at my door; by\n",
      "which, being suddenly awaked, I was in some kind of terror.  I heard the\n",
      "word _Burglum_ repeated incessantly: several of the emperor’s court,\n",
      "making their way through the crowd, entreated me to come immediately to\n",
      "the palace, where her imperial majesty’s apartment was on fire, by the\n",
      "carelessness of a maid of honour, who fell asleep while she was reading a\n",
      "romance.  I got up in an instant; and orders being given to clear the way\n",
      "before me, and it being likewise a moonshine night, I made a shift to get\n",
      "to the palace without trampling on any of the people.  I found they had\n",
      "already applied ladders to the walls of the apartment, and were well\n",
      "provided with buckets, but the water was at some distance.  These buckets\n",
      "were about the size of large thimbles, and the poor people supplied me\n",
      "with them as fast as they could: but the flame was so violent that they\n",
      "did little good.  I might easily have stifled it with my coat, which I\n",
      "unfortunately left behind me for haste, and came away only in my leathern\n",
      "jerkin.  The case seemed wholly desperate and deplorable; and this\n",
      "magnificent palace would have infallibly been burnt down to the ground,\n",
      "if, by a presence of mind unusual to me, I had not suddenly thought of an\n",
      "expedient.  I had, the evening before, drunk plentifully of a most\n",
      "delicious wine called _glimigrim_, (the Blefuscudians call it _flunec_,\n",
      "but ours is esteemed the better sort,) which is very diuretic.  By the\n",
      "luckiest chance in the world, I had not discharged myself of any part of\n",
      "it.  The heat I had contracted by coming very near the flames, and by\n",
      "labouring to quench them, made the wine begin to operate by urine; which\n",
      "I voided in such a quantity, and applied so well to the proper places,\n",
      "that in three minutes the fire was wholly extinguished, and the rest of\n",
      "that noble pile, which had cost so many ages in erecting, preserved from\n",
      "destruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now day-light, and I returned to my house without waiting to\n",
      "congratulate with the emperor: because, although I had done a very\n",
      "eminent piece of service, yet I could not tell how his majesty might\n",
      "resent the manner by which I had performed it: for, by the fundamental\n",
      "laws of the realm, it is capital in any person, of what quality soever,\n",
      "to make water within the precincts of the palace.  But I was a little\n",
      "comforted by a message from his majesty, “that he would give orders to\n",
      "the grand justiciary for passing my pardon in form:” which, however, I\n",
      "could not obtain; and I was privately assured, “that the empress,\n",
      "conceiving the greatest abhorrence of what I had done, removed to the\n",
      "most distant side of the court, firmly resolved that those buildings\n",
      "should never be repaired for her use: and, in the presence of her chief\n",

      "which to my sight, were almost invisible; but nature has adapted the eyes\n",
      "of the Lilliputians to all objects proper for their view: they see with\n",
      "great exactness, but at no great distance.  And, to show the sharpness of\n",
      "their sight towards objects that are near, I have been much pleased with\n",
      "observing a cook pulling a lark, which was not so large as a common fly;\n",
      "and a young girl threading an invisible needle with invisible silk.\n",
      "Their tallest trees are about seven feet high: I mean some of those in\n",
      "the great royal park, the tops whereof I could but just reach with my\n",
      "fist clenched.  The other vegetables are in the same proportion; but this\n",

      "I shall say but little at present of their learning, which, for many\n",

      "turn upside down, and by this means they shall, at their resurrection, be\n",

      "wished they were as well executed.  The first I shall mention, relates to\n",
      "informers.  All crimes against the state, are punished here with the\n",
      "utmost severity; but, if the person accused makes his innocence plainly\n",
      "to appear upon his trial, the accuser is immediately put to an\n",

      "quadruply recompensed for the loss of his time, for the danger he\n",
      "underwent, for the hardship of his imprisonment, and for all the charges\n",
      "he has been at in making his defence; or, if that fund be deficient, it\n",
      "is largely supplied by the crown.  The emperor also confers on him some\n",
      "public mark of his favour, and proclamation is made of his innocence\n",
      "through the whole city.\n",
      "\n",
      "They look upon fraud as a greater crime than theft, and therefore seldom\n",
      "fail to punish it with death; for they allege, that care and vigilance,\n",
      "with a very common understanding, may preserve a man’s goods from\n",
      "thieves, but honesty has no defence against superior cunning; and, since\n",
      "it is necessary that there should be a perpetual intercourse of buying\n",

      "residence of nine months, and thirteen days.  Having a head mechanically\n",
      "turned, and being likewise forced by necessity, I had made for myself a\n",
      "table and chair convenient enough, out of the largest trees in the royal\n",
      "park.  Two hundred sempstresses were employed to make me shirts, and\n",
      "linen for my bed and table, all of the strongest and coarsest kind they\n",
      "could get; which, however, they were forced to quilt together in several\n",
      "folds, for the thickest was some degrees finer than lawn.  Their linen is\n",
      "usually three inches wide, and three feet make a piece.  The sempstresses\n",
      "took my measure as I lay on the ground, one standing at my neck, and\n",
      "another at my mid-leg, with a strong cord extended, that each held by the\n",
      "end, while a third measured the length of the cord with a rule of an inch\n",
      "long.  Then they measured my right thumb, and desired no more; for by a\n",
      "mathematical computation, that twice round the thumb is once round the\n",
      "wrist, and so on to the neck and the waist, and by the help of my old\n",
      "shirt, which I displayed on the ground before them for a pattern, they\n",
      "fitted me exactly.  Three hundred tailors were employed in the same\n",
      "manner to make me clothes; but they had another contrivance for taking my\n",
      "measure.  I kneeled down, and they raised a ladder from the ground to my\n",
      "neck; upon this ladder one of them mounted, and let fall a plumb-line\n",
      "from my collar to the floor, which just answered the length of my coat:\n",
      "but my waist and arms I measured myself.  When my clothes were finished,\n",
      "which was done in my house (for the largest of theirs would not have been\n",
      "able to hold them), they looked like the patch-work made by the ladies in\n",

      "them on the table: a hundred more attended below on the ground, some with\n",
      "dishes of meat, and some with barrels of wine and other liquors slung on\n",
      "their shoulders; all which the waiters above drew up, as I wanted, in a\n",
      "very ingenious manner, by certain cords, as we draw the bucket up a well\n",
      "in Europe.  A dish of their meat was a good mouthful, and a barrel of\n",
      "their liquor a reasonable draught.  Their mutton yields to ours, but\n",
      "their beef is excellent.  I have had a sirloin so large, that I have been\n",

      "them.  Flimnap, the lord high treasurer, attended there likewise with his\n",
      "white staff; and I observed he often looked on me with a sour\n",
      "countenance, which I would not seem to regard, but ate more than usual,\n",
      "in honour to my dear country, as well as to fill the court with\n",
      "admiration.  I have some private reasons to believe, that this visit from\n",
      "his majesty gave Flimnap an opportunity of doing me ill offices to his\n",
      "master.  That minister had always been my secret enemy, though he\n",
      "outwardly caressed me more than was usual to the moroseness of his\n",

      "treasury; that he was forced to take up money at a great discount; that\n",
      "exchequer bills would not circulate under nine per cent. below par; that\n",

      "greatest gold coin, about the bigness of a spangle) “and, upon the whole,\n",

      "\n",
      "I am here obliged to vindicate the reputation of an excellent lady, who\n",
      "was an innocent sufferer upon my account.  The treasurer took a fancy to\n",
      "be jealous of his wife, from the malice of some evil tongues, who\n",
      "informed him that her grace had taken a violent affection for my person;\n",
      "and the court scandal ran for some time, that she once came privately to\n",
      "my lodging.  This I solemnly declare to be a most infamous falsehood,\n",
      "without any grounds, further than that her grace was pleased to treat me\n",
      "with all innocent marks of freedom and friendship.  I own she came often\n",
      "to my house, but always publicly, nor ever without three more in the\n",
      "coach, who were usually her sister and young daughter, and some\n",
      "particular acquaintance; but this was common to many other ladies of the\n",
      "court.  And I still appeal to my servants round, whether they at any time\n",
      "saw a coach at my door, without knowing what persons were in it.  On\n",
      "those occasions, when a servant had given me notice, my custom was to go\n",
      "immediately to the door, and, after paying my respects, to take up the\n",
      "coach and two horses very carefully in my hands (for, if there were six\n",
      "horses, the postillion always unharnessed four,) and place them on a\n",
      "table, where I had fixed a movable rim quite round, of five inches high,\n",
      "to prevent accidents.  And I have often had four coaches and horses at\n",
      "once on my table, full of company, while I sat in my chair, leaning my\n",
      "face towards them; and when I was engaged with one set, the coachmen\n",
      "would gently drive the others round my table.  I have passed many an\n",
      "afternoon very agreeably in these conversations.  But I defy the\n",
      "treasurer, or his two informers (I will name them, and let them make the\n",
      "best of it) Clustril and Drunlo, to prove that any person ever came to me\n",
      "_incognito_, except the secretary Reldresal, who was sent by express\n",
      "command of his imperial majesty, as I have before related.  I should not\n",
      "have dwelt so long upon this particular, if it had not been a point\n",
      "wherein the reputation of a great lady is so nearly concerned, to say\n",
      "nothing of my own; though I then had the honour to be a _nardac_, which\n",

      "_glumglum_, a title inferior by one degree, as that of a marquis is to a\n",

      "his majesty gave many marks of his great lenity; often urging the\n",
      "services you had done him, and endeavouring to extenuate your crimes.\n",
      "The treasurer and admiral insisted that you should be put to the most\n",
      "painful and ignominious death, by setting fire to your house at night,\n",
      "and the general was to attend with twenty thousand men, armed with\n",
      "poisoned arrows, to shoot you on the face and hands.  Some of your\n",
      "servants were to have private orders to strew a poisonous juice on your\n",
      "shirts and sheets, which would soon make you tear your own flesh, and die\n",
      "in the utmost torture.  The general came into the same opinion; so that\n",

      "“Upon this incident, Reldresal, principal secretary for private affairs,\n",
      "who always approved himself your true friend, was commanded by the\n",
      "emperor to deliver his opinion, which he accordingly did; and therein\n",
      "justified the good thoughts you have of him.  He allowed your crimes to\n",
      "be great, but that still there was room for mercy, the most commendable\n",
      "virtue in a prince, and for which his majesty was so justly celebrated.\n",
      "He said, the friendship between you and him was so well known to the\n",
      "world, that perhaps the most honourable board might think him partial;\n",
      "however, in obedience to the command he had received, he would freely\n",
      "offer his sentiments.  That if his majesty, in consideration of your\n",
      "services, and pursuant to his own merciful disposition, would please to\n",
      "spare your life, and only give orders to put out both your eyes, he\n",
      "humbly conceived, that by this expedient justice might in some measure be\n",
      "satisfied, and all the world would applaud the lenity of the emperor, as\n",
      "well as the fair and generous proceedings of those who have the honour to\n",
      "be his counsellors.  That the loss of your eyes would be no impediment to\n",
      "your bodily strength, by which you might still be useful to his majesty;\n",
      "that blindness is an addition to courage, by concealing dangers from us;\n",
      "that the fear you had for your eyes, was the greatest difficulty in\n",
      "bringing over the enemy’s fleet, and it would be sufficient for you to\n",
      "see by the eyes of the ministers, since the greatest princes do no more.\n",
      "\n",

      "up in fury, said, he wondered how the secretary durst presume to give his\n",
      "opinion for preserving the life of a traitor; that the services you had\n",
      "performed were, by all true reasons of state, the great aggravation of\n",
      "your crimes; that you, who were able to extinguish the fire by discharge\n",
      "of urine in her majesty’s apartment (which he mentioned with horror),\n",
      "might, at another time, raise an inundation by the same means, to drown\n",
      "the whole palace; and the same strength which enabled you to bring over\n",
      "the enemy’s fleet, might serve, upon the first discontent, to carry it\n",
      "back; that he had good reasons to think you were a Big-endian in your\n",
      "heart; and, as treason begins in the heart, before it appears in\n",
      "overt-acts, so he accused you as a traitor on that account, and therefore\n",
      "insisted you should be put to death.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The treasurer was of the same opinion: he showed to what straits his\n",
      "majesty’s revenue was reduced, by the charge of maintaining you, which\n",
      "would soon grow insupportable; that the secretary’s expedient of putting\n",
      "out your eyes, was so far from being a remedy against this evil, that it\n",
      "would probably increase it, as is manifest from the common practice of\n",
      "blinding some kind of fowls, after which they fed the faster, and grew\n",
      "sooner fat; that his sacred majesty and the council, who are your judges,\n",
      "were, in their own consciences, fully convinced of your guilt, which was\n",
      "a sufficient argument to condemn you to death, without the formal proofs\n",
      "required by the strict letter of the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But his imperial majesty, fully determined against capital punishment,\n",
      "was graciously pleased to say, that since the council thought the loss of\n",
      "your eyes too easy a censure, some other way may be inflicted hereafter.\n",
      "And your friend the secretary, humbly desiring to be heard again, in\n",
      "answer to what the treasurer had objected, concerning the great charge\n",
      "his majesty was at in maintaining you, said, that his excellency, who had\n",
      "the sole disposal of the emperor’s revenue, might easily provide against\n",
      "that evil, by gradually lessening your establishment; by which, for want\n",
      "of sufficient for you would grow weak and faint, and lose your appetite,\n",
      "and consequently, decay, and consume in a few months; neither would the\n",
      "stench of your carcass be then so dangerous, when it should become more\n",
      "than half diminished; and immediately upon your death five or six\n",
      "thousand of his majesty’s subjects might, in two or three days, cut your\n",
      "flesh from your bones, take it away by cart-loads, and bury it in distant\n",

      "by degrees should be kept a secret; but the sentence of putting out your\n",
      "eyes was entered on the books; none dissenting, except Bolgolam the\n",
      "admiral, who, being a creature of the empress, was perpetually instigated\n",
      "by her majesty to insist upon your death, she having borne perpetual\n",
      "malice against you, on account of that infamous and illegal method you\n",

      "you are only condemned to the loss of your eyes, which his majesty does\n",
      "not question you will gratefully and humbly submit to; and twenty of his\n",
      "majesty’s surgeons will attend, in order to see the operation well\n",

      "It was a custom introduced by this prince and his ministry (very\n",
      "different, as I have been assured, from the practice of former times,)\n",
      "that after the court had decreed any cruel execution, either to gratify\n",
      "the monarch’s resentment, or the malice of a favourite, the emperor\n",
      "always made a speech to his whole council, expressing his great lenity\n",
      "and tenderness, as qualities known and confessed by all the world.  This\n",
      "speech was immediately published throughout the kingdom; nor did any\n",
      "thing terrify the people so much as those encomiums on his majesty’s\n",
      "mercy; because it was observed, that the more these praises were enlarged\n",
      "and insisted on, the more inhuman was the punishment, and the sufferer\n",
      "more innocent.  Yet, as to myself, I must confess, having never been\n",
      "designed for a courtier, either by my birth or education, I was so ill a\n",
      "judge of things, that I could not discover the lenity and favour of this\n",
      "sentence, but conceived it (perhaps erroneously) rather to be rigorous\n",
      "than gentle.  I sometimes thought of standing my trial, for, although I\n",
      "could not deny the facts alleged in the several articles, yet I hoped\n",
      "they would admit of some extenuation.  But having in my life perused many\n",
      "state-trials, which I ever observed to terminate as the judges thought\n",
      "fit to direct, I durst not rely on so dangerous a decision, in so\n",
      "critical a juncture, and against such powerful enemies.  Once I was\n",
      "strongly bent upon resistance, for, while I had liberty the whole\n",
      "strength of that empire could hardly subdue me, and I might easily with\n",
      "stones pelt the metropolis to pieces; but I soon rejected that project\n",
      "with horror, by remembering the oath I had made to the emperor, the\n",
      "favours I received from him, and the high title of _nardac_ he conferred\n",
      "upon me.  Neither had I so soon learned the gratitude of courtiers, to\n",
      "persuade myself, that his majesty’s present seventies acquitted me of all\n",
      "past obligations.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, I fixed upon a resolution, for which it is probable I may incur\n",
      "some censure, and not unjustly; for I confess I owe the preserving of\n",
      "mine eyes, and consequently my liberty, to my own great rashness and want\n",
      "of experience; because, if I had then known the nature of princes and\n",
      "ministers, which I have since observed in many other courts, and their\n",
      "methods of treating criminals less obnoxious than myself, I should, with\n",
      "great alacrity and readiness, have submitted to so easy a punishment.\n",
      "But hurried on by the precipitancy of youth, and having his imperial\n",
      "majesty’s license to pay my attendance upon the emperor of Blefuscu, I\n",
      "took this opportunity, before the three days were elapsed, to send a\n",
      "letter to my friend the secretary, signifying my resolution of setting\n",
      "out that morning for Blefuscu, pursuant to the leave I had got; and,\n",
      "without waiting for an answer, I went to that side of the island where\n",
      "our fleet lay.  I seized a large man of war, tied a cable to the prow,\n",
      "and, lifting up the anchors, I stripped myself, put my clothes (together\n",
      "with my coverlet, which I carried under my arm) into the vessel, and,\n",
      "drawing it after me, between wading and swimming arrived at the royal\n",
      "port of Blefuscu, where the people had long expected me: they lent me two\n",
      "guides to direct me to the capital city, which is of the same name.  I\n",
      "held them in my hands, till I came within two hundred yards of the gate,\n",
      "and desired them “to signify my arrival to one of the secretaries, and\n",

      "about an hour, “that his majesty, attended by the royal family, and great\n",

      "hundred yards.  The emperor and his train alighted from their horses, the\n",
      "empress and ladies from their coaches, and I did not perceive they were\n",
      "in any fright or concern.  I lay on the ground to kiss his majesty’s and\n",
      "the empress’s hands.  I told his majesty, “that I was come according to\n",
      "my promise, and with the license of the emperor my master, to have the\n",
      "honour of seeing so mighty a monarch, and to offer him any service in my\n",
      "power, consistent with my duty to my own prince;” not mentioning a word\n",
      "of my disgrace, because I had hitherto no regular information of it, and\n",
      "might suppose myself wholly ignorant of any such design; neither could I\n",
      "reasonably conceive that the emperor would discover the secret, while I\n",
      "was out of his power; wherein, however, it soon appeared I was deceived.\n",

      "I shall not trouble the reader with the particular account of my\n",
      "reception at this court, which was suitable to the generosity of so great\n",

      "\n",
      "The author, by a lucky accident, finds means to leave Blefuscu; and,\n",
      "after some difficulties, returns safe to his native country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three days after my arrival, walking out of curiosity to the north-east\n",
      "coast of the island, I observed, about half a league off in the sea,\n",
      "somewhat that looked like a boat overturned.  I pulled off my shoes and\n",
      "stockings, and, wailing two or three hundred yards, I found the object to\n",
      "approach nearer by force of the tide; and then plainly saw it to be a\n",
      "real boat, which I supposed might by some tempest have been driven from a\n",
      "ship.  Whereupon, I returned immediately towards the city, and desired\n",
      "his imperial majesty to lend me twenty of the tallest vessels he had\n",
      "left, after the loss of his fleet, and three thousand seamen, under the\n",
      "command of his vice-admiral.  This fleet sailed round, while I went back\n",
      "the shortest way to the coast, where I first discovered the boat.  I\n",
      "found the tide had driven it still nearer.  The seamen were all provided\n",
      "with cordage, which I had beforehand twisted to a sufficient strength.\n",
      "When the ships came up, I stripped myself, and waded till I came within a\n",
      "hundred yards off the boat, after which I was forced to swim till I got\n",
      "up to it.  The seamen threw me the end of the cord, which I fastened to a\n",
      "hole in the fore-part of the boat, and the other end to a man of war; but\n",
      "I found all my labour to little purpose; for, being out of my depth, I\n",
      "was not able to work.  In this necessity I was forced to swim behind, and\n",
      "push the boat forward, as often as I could, with one of my hands; and the\n",
      "tide favouring me, I advanced so far that I could just hold up my chin\n",
      "and feel the ground.  I rested two or three minutes, and then gave the\n",
      "boat another shove, and so on, till the sea was no higher than my\n",
      "arm-pits; and now, the most laborious part being over, I took out my\n",
      "other cables, which were stowed in one of the ships, and fastened them\n",
      "first to the boat, and then to nine of the vessels which attended me; the\n",
      "wind being favourable, the seamen towed, and I shoved, until we arrived\n",
      "within forty yards of the shore; and, waiting till the tide was out, I\n",
      "got dry to the boat, and by the assistance of two thousand men, with\n",
      "ropes and engines, I made a shift to turn it on its bottom, and found it\n",
      "was but little damaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall not trouble the reader with the difficulties I was under, by the\n",
      "help of certain paddles, which cost me ten days making, to get my boat to\n",
      "the royal port of Blefuscu, where a mighty concourse of people appeared\n",
      "upon my arrival, full of wonder at the sight of so prodigious a vessel.\n",
      "I told the emperor “that my good fortune had thrown this boat in my way,\n",
      "to carry me to some place whence I might return into my native country;\n",
      "and begged his majesty’s orders for getting materials to fit it up,\n",
      "together with his license to depart;” which, after some kind\n",
      "expostulations, he was pleased to grant.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did very much wonder, in all this time, not to have heard of any\n",
      "express relating to me from our emperor to the court of Blefuscu.  But I\n",
      "was afterward given privately to understand, that his imperial majesty,\n",
      "never imagining I had the least notice of his designs, believed I was\n",
      "only gone to Blefuscu in performance of my promise, according to the\n",
      "license he had given me, which was well known at our court, and would\n",
      "return in a few days, when the ceremony was ended.  But he was at last in\n",
      "pain at my long absence; and after consulting with the treasurer and the\n",
      "rest of that cabal, a person of quality was dispatched with the copy of\n",
      "the articles against me.  This envoy had instructions to represent to the\n",
      "monarch of Blefuscu, “the great lenity of his master, who was content to\n",
      "punish me no farther than with the loss of mine eyes; that I had fled\n",
      "from justice; and if I did not return in two hours, I should be deprived\n",
      "of my title of _nardac_, and declared a traitor.”  The envoy further\n",
      "added, “that in order to maintain the peace and amity between both\n",
      "empires, his master expected that his brother of Blefuscu would give\n",
      "orders to have me sent back to Lilliput, bound hand and foot, to be\n",
      "punished as a traitor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The emperor of Blefuscu, having taken three days to consult, returned an\n",
      "answer consisting of many civilities and excuses.  He said, “that as for\n",
      "sending me bound, his brother knew it was impossible; that, although I\n",
      "had deprived him of his fleet, yet he owed great obligations to me for\n",
      "many good offices I had done him in making the peace.  That, however,\n",
      "both their majesties would soon be made easy; for I had found a\n",
      "prodigious vessel on the shore, able to carry me on the sea, which he had\n",
      "given orders to fit up, with my own assistance and direction; and he\n",
      "hoped, in a few weeks, both empires would be freed from so insupportable\n",
      "an encumbrance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With this answer the envoy returned to Lilliput; and the monarch of\n",
      "Blefuscu related to me all that had passed; offering me at the same time\n",
      "(but under the strictest confidence) his gracious protection, if I would\n",
      "continue in his service; wherein, although I believed him sincere, yet I\n",
      "resolved never more to put any confidence in princes or ministers, where\n",
      "I could possibly avoid it; and therefore, with all due acknowledgments\n",
      "for his favourable intentions, I humbly begged to be excused.  I told\n",
      "him, “that since fortune, whether good or evil, had thrown a vessel in my\n",
      "way, I was resolved to venture myself on the ocean, rather than be an\n",
      "occasion of difference between two such mighty monarchs.”  Neither did I\n",
      "find the emperor at all displeased; and I discovered, by a certain\n",
      "accident, that he was very glad of my resolution, and so were most of his\n",
      "ministers.\n",
      "\n",
      "These considerations moved me to hasten my departure somewhat sooner than\n",
      "I intended; to which the court, impatient to have me gone, very readily\n",
      "contributed.  Five hundred workmen were employed to make two sails to my\n",
      "boat, according to my directions, by quilting thirteen folds of their\n",
      "strongest linen together.  I was at the pains of making ropes and cables,\n",
      "by twisting ten, twenty, or thirty of the thickest and strongest of\n",
      "theirs.  A great stone that I happened to find, after a long search, by\n",
      "the sea-shore, served me for an anchor.  I had the tallow of three\n",
      "hundred cows, for greasing my boat, and other uses.  I was at incredible\n",
      "pains in cutting down some of the largest timber-trees, for oars and\n",
      "masts, wherein I was, however, much assisted by his majesty’s\n",
      "ship-carpenters, who helped me in smoothing them, after I had done the\n",
      "rough work.\n",
      "\n",
      "In about a month, when all was prepared, I sent to receive his majesty’s\n",
      "commands, and to take my leave.  The emperor and royal family came out of\n",
      "the palace; I lay down on my face to kiss his hand, which he very\n",
      "graciously gave me: so did the empress and young princes of the blood.\n",
      "His majesty presented me with fifty purses of two hundred _sprugs_\n",
      "a-piece, together with his picture at full length, which I put\n",
      "immediately into one of my gloves, to keep it from being hurt.  The\n",
      "ceremonies at my departure were too many to trouble the reader with at\n",
      "this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I stored the boat with the carcases of a hundred oxen, and three hundred\n",
      "sheep, with bread and drink proportionable, and as much meat ready\n",
      "dressed as four hundred cooks could provide.  I took with me six cows and\n",
      "two bulls alive, with as many ewes and rams, intending to carry them into\n",
      "my own country, and propagate the breed.  And to feed them on board, I\n",
      "had a good bundle of hay, and a bag of corn.  I would gladly have taken a\n",
      "dozen of the natives, but this was a thing the emperor would by no means\n",
      "permit; and, besides a diligent search into my pockets, his majesty\n",
      "engaged my honour “not to carry away any of his subjects, although with\n",
      "their own consent and desire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Having thus prepared all things as well as I was able, I set sail on the\n",
      "twenty-fourth day of September 1701, at six in the morning; and when I\n",
      "had gone about four-leagues to the northward, the wind being at\n",
      "south-east, at six in the evening I descried a small island, about half a\n",
      "league to the north-west.  I advanced forward, and cast anchor on the\n",
      "lee-side of the island, which seemed to be uninhabited.  I then took some\n",
      "refreshment, and went to my rest.  I slept well, and as I conjectured at\n",
      "least six hours, for I found the day broke in two hours after I awaked.\n",
      "It was a clear night.  I ate my breakfast before the sun was up; and\n",
      "heaving anchor, the wind being favourable, I steered the same course that\n",
      "I had done the day before, wherein I was directed by my pocket compass.\n",
      "My intention was to reach, if possible, one of those islands which I had\n",
      "reason to believe lay to the north-east of Van Diemen’s Land.  I\n",
      "discovered nothing all that day; but upon the next, about three in the\n",
      "afternoon, when I had by my computation made twenty-four leagues from\n",
      "Blefuscu, I descried a sail steering to the south-east; my course was due\n",
      "east.  I hailed her, but could get no answer; yet I found I gained upon\n",
      "her, for the wind slackened.  I made all the sail I could, and in half an\n",
      "hour she spied me, then hung out her ancient, and discharged a gun.  It\n",
      "is not easy to express the joy I was in, upon the unexpected hope of once\n",

      "ship slackened her sails, and I came up with her between five and six in\n",
      "the evening, September 26th; but my heart leaped within me to see her\n",
      "English colours.  I put my cows and sheep into my coat-pockets, and got\n",
      "on board with all my little cargo of provisions.  The vessel was an\n",
      "English merchantman, returning from Japan by the North and South seas;\n",
      "the captain, Mr. John Biddel, of Deptford, a very civil man, and an\n",
      "excellent sailor.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were now in the latitude of 30 degrees south; there were about fifty\n",
      "men in the ship; and here I met an old comrade of mine, one Peter\n",
      "Williams, who gave me a good character to the captain.  This gentleman\n",
      "treated me with kindness, and desired I would let him know what place I\n",
      "came from last, and whither I was bound; which I did in a few words, but\n",
      "he thought I was raving, and that the dangers I underwent had disturbed\n",
      "my head; whereupon I took my black cattle and sheep out of my pocket,\n",
      "which, after great astonishment, clearly convinced him of my veracity.  I\n",
      "then showed him the gold given me by the emperor of Blefuscu, together\n",
      "with his majesty’s picture at full length, and some other rarities of\n",
      "that country.  I gave him two purses of two hundreds _sprugs_ each, and\n",
      "promised, when we arrived in England, to make him a present of a cow and\n",
      "a sheep big with young.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall not trouble the reader with a particular account of this voyage,\n",
      "which was very prosperous for the most part.  We arrived in the Downs on\n",
      "the 13th of April, 1702.  I had only one misfortune, that the rats on\n",
      "board carried away one of my sheep; I found her bones in a hole, picked\n",
      "clean from the flesh.  The rest of my cattle I got safe ashore, and set\n",
      "them a-grazing in a bowling-green at Greenwich, where the fineness of the\n",
      "grass made them feed very heartily, though I had always feared the\n",
      "contrary: neither could I possibly have preserved them in so long a\n",
      "voyage, if the captain had not allowed me some of his best biscuit,\n",
      "which, rubbed to powder, and mingled with water, was their constant food.\n",
      "The short time I continued in England, I made a considerable profit by\n",
      "showing my cattle to many persons of quality and others: and before I\n",
      "began my second voyage, I sold them for six hundred pounds.  Since my\n",
      "last return I find the breed is considerably increased, especially the\n",
      "sheep, which I hope will prove much to the advantage of the woollen\n",
      "manufacture, by the fineness of the fleeces.\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed but two months with my wife and family, for my insatiable desire\n",
      "of seeing foreign countries, would suffer me to continue no longer.  I\n",
      "left fifteen hundred pounds with my wife, and fixed her in a good house\n",
      "at Redriff.  My remaining stock I carried with me, part in money and part\n",
      "in goods, in hopes to improve my fortunes.  My eldest uncle John had left\n",
      "me an estate in land, near Epping, of about thirty pounds a-year; and I\n",
      "had a long lease of the Black Bull in Fetter-Lane, which yielded me as\n",
      "much more; so that I was not in any danger of leaving my family upon the\n",
      "parish.  My son Johnny, named so after his uncle, was at the\n",
      "grammar-school, and a towardly child.  My daughter Betty (who is now well\n",
      "married, and has children) was then at her needle-work.  I took leave of\n",

      "unshipped our goods and wintered there; for the captain falling sick of\n",
      "an ague, we could not leave the Cape till the end of March.  We then set\n",
      "sail, and had a good voyage till we passed the Straits of Madagascar; but\n",
      "having got northward of that island, and to about five degrees south\n",
      "latitude, the winds, which in those seas are observed to blow a constant\n",
      "equal gale between the north and west, from the beginning of December to\n",
      "the beginning of May, on the 19th of April began to blow with much\n",
      "greater violence, and more westerly than usual, continuing so for twenty\n",
      "days together: during which time, we were driven a little to the east of\n",
      "the Molucca Islands, and about three degrees northward of the line, as\n",
      "our captain found by an observation he took the 2nd of May, at which time\n",
      "the wind ceased, and it was a perfect calm, whereat I was not a little\n",
      "rejoiced.  But he, being a man well experienced in the navigation of\n",
      "those seas, bid us all prepare against a storm, which accordingly\n",
      "happened the day following: for the southern wind, called the southern\n",
      "monsoon, began to set in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finding it was likely to overblow, we took in our sprit-sail, and stood\n",
      "by to hand the fore-sail; but making foul weather, we looked the guns\n",
      "were all fast, and handed the mizen.  The ship lay very broad off, so we\n",
      "thought it better spooning before the sea, than trying or hulling.  We\n",
      "reefed the fore-sail and set him, and hauled aft the fore-sheet; the helm\n",
      "was hard a-weather.  The ship wore bravely.  We belayed the fore\n",
      "down-haul; but the sail was split, and we hauled down the yard, and got\n",
      "the sail into the ship, and unbound all the things clear of it.  It was a\n",
      "very fierce storm; the sea broke strange and dangerous.  We hauled off\n",
      "upon the laniard of the whip-staff, and helped the man at the helm.  We\n",
      "would not get down our topmast, but let all stand, because she scudded\n",
      "before the sea very well, and we knew that the top-mast being aloft, the\n",
      "ship was the wholesomer, and made better way through the sea, seeing we\n",
      "had sea-room.  When the storm was over, we set fore-sail and main-sail,\n",
      "and brought the ship to.  Then we set the mizen, main-top-sail, and the\n",
      "fore-top-sail.  Our course was east-north-east, the wind was at\n",
      "south-west.  We got the starboard tacks aboard, we cast off our\n",
      "weather-braces and lifts; we set in the lee-braces, and hauled forward by\n",
      "the weather-bowlings, and hauled them tight, and belayed them, and hauled\n",
      "over the mizen tack to windward, and kept her full and by as near as she\n",
      "would lie.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this storm, which was followed by a strong wind west-south-west,\n",
      "we were carried, by my computation, about five hundred leagues to the\n",
      "east, so that the oldest sailor on board could not tell in what part of\n",
      "the world we were.  Our provisions held out well, our ship was staunch,\n",
      "and our crew all in good health; but we lay in the utmost distress for\n",
      "water.  We thought it best to hold on the same course, rather than turn\n",
      "more northerly, which might have brought us to the north-west part of\n",
      "Great Tartary, and into the Frozen Sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the 16th day of June, 1703, a boy on the top-mast discovered land.  On\n",
      "the 17th, we came in full view of a great island, or continent (for we\n",
      "knew not whether;) on the south side whereof was a small neck of land\n",
      "jutting out into the sea, and a creek too shallow to hold a ship of above\n",
      "one hundred tons.  We cast anchor within a league of this creek, and our\n",
      "captain sent a dozen of his men well armed in the long-boat, with vessels\n",
      "for water, if any could be found.  I desired his leave to go with them,\n",
      "that I might see the country, and make what discoveries I could.  When we\n",
      "came to land we saw no river or spring, nor any sign of inhabitants.  Our\n",
      "men therefore wandered on the shore to find out some fresh water near the\n",
      "sea, and I walked alone about a mile on the other side, where I observed\n",
      "the country all barren and rocky.  I now began to be weary, and seeing\n",
      "nothing to entertain my curiosity, I returned gently down towards the\n",
      "creek; and the sea being full in my view, I saw our men already got into\n",
      "the boat, and rowing for life to the ship.  I was going to holla after\n",
      "them, although it had been to little purpose, when I observed a huge\n",
      "creature walking after them in the sea, as fast as he could: he waded not\n",
      "much deeper than his knees, and took prodigious strides: but our men had\n",
      "the start of him half a league, and, the sea thereabouts being full of\n",
      "sharp-pointed rocks, the monster was not able to overtake the boat.  This\n",
      "I was afterwards told, for I durst not stay to see the issue of the\n",
      "adventure; but ran as fast as I could the way I first went, and then\n",
      "climbed up a steep hill, which gave me some prospect of the country.  I\n",
      "found it fully cultivated; but that which first surprised me was the\n",
      "length of the grass, which, in those grounds that seemed to be kept for\n",
      "hay, was about twenty feet high.\n",
      "\n",
      "I fell into a high road, for so I took it to be, though it served to the\n",
      "inhabitants only as a foot-path through a field of barley.  Here I walked\n",
      "on for some time, but could see little on either side, it being now near\n",
      "harvest, and the corn rising at least forty feet.  I was an hour walking\n",
      "to the end of this field, which was fenced in with a hedge of at least\n",
      "one hundred and twenty feet high, and the trees so lofty that I could\n",
      "make no computation of their altitude.  There was a stile to pass from\n",
      "this field into the next.  It had four steps, and a stone to cross over\n",
      "when you came to the uppermost.  It was impossible for me to climb this\n",
      "stile, because every step was six-feet high, and the upper stone about\n",
      "twenty.  I was endeavouring to find some gap in the hedge, when I\n",
      "discovered one of the inhabitants in the next field, advancing towards\n",
      "the stile, of the same size with him whom I saw in the sea pursuing our\n",
      "boat.  He appeared as tall as an ordinary spire steeple, and took about\n",
      "ten yards at every stride, as near as I could guess.  I was struck with\n",
      "the utmost fear and astonishment, and ran to hide myself in the corn,\n",
      "whence I saw him at the top of the stile looking back into the next field\n",
      "on the right hand, and heard him call in a voice many degrees louder than\n",
      "a speaking-trumpet: but the noise was so high in the air, that at first I\n",
      "certainly thought it was thunder.  Whereupon seven monsters, like\n",
      "himself, came towards him with reaping-hooks in their hands, each hook\n",
      "about the largeness of six scythes.  These people were not so well clad\n",
      "as the first, whose servants or labourers they seemed to be; for, upon\n",
      "some words he spoke, they went to reap the corn in the field where I lay.\n",
      "I kept from them at as great a distance as I could, but was forced to\n",
      "move with extreme difficulty, for the stalks of the corn were sometimes\n",
      "not above a foot distant, so that I could hardly squeeze my body betwixt\n",
      "them.  However, I made a shift to go forward, till I came to a part of\n",
      "the field where the corn had been laid by the rain and wind.  Here it was\n",
      "impossible for me to advance a step; for the stalks were so interwoven,\n",
      "that I could not creep through, and the beards of the fallen ears so\n",
      "strong and pointed, that they pierced through my clothes into my flesh.\n",
      "At the same time I heard the reapers not a hundred yards behind me.\n",
      "Being quite dispirited with toil, and wholly overcome by grief and\n",
      "dispair, I lay down between two ridges, and heartily wished I might there\n",
      "end my days.  I bemoaned my desolate widow and fatherless children.  I\n",
      "lamented my own folly and wilfulness, in attempting a second voyage,\n",
      "against the advice of all my friends and relations.  In this terrible\n",
      "agitation of mind, I could not forbear thinking of Lilliput, whose\n",
      "inhabitants looked upon me as the greatest prodigy that ever appeared in\n",
      "the world; where I was able to draw an imperial fleet in my hand, and\n",
      "perform those other actions, which will be recorded for ever in the\n",
      "chronicles of that empire, while posterity shall hardly believe them,\n",
      "although attested by millions.  I reflected what a mortification it must\n",
      "prove to me, to appear as inconsiderable in this nation, as one single\n",
      "Lilliputian would be among us.  But this I conceived was to be the least\n",
      "of my misfortunes; for, as human creatures are observed to be more savage\n",
      "and cruel in proportion to their bulk, what could I expect but to be a\n",
      "morsel in the mouth of the first among these enormous barbarians that\n",
      "should happen to seize me?  Undoubtedly philosophers are in the right,\n",
      "when they tell us that nothing is great or little otherwise than by\n",
      "comparison.  It might have pleased fortune, to have let the Lilliputians\n",
      "find some nation, where the people were as diminutive with respect to\n",
      "them, as they were to me.  And who knows but that even this prodigious\n",
      "race of mortals might be equally overmatched in some distant part of the\n",
      "world, whereof we have yet no discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scared and confounded as I was, I could not forbear going on with these\n",
      "reflections, when one of the reapers, approaching within ten yards of the\n",
      "ridge where I lay, made me apprehend that with the next step I should be\n",
      "squashed to death under his foot, or cut in two with his reaping-hook.\n",
      "And therefore, when he was again about to move, I screamed as loud as\n",
      "fear could make me: whereupon the huge creature trod short, and, looking\n",
      "round about under him for some time, at last espied me as I lay on the\n",
      "ground.  He considered awhile, with the caution of one who endeavours to\n",
      "lay hold on a small dangerous animal in such a manner that it shall not\n",
      "be able either to scratch or bite him, as I myself have sometimes done\n",
      "with a weasel in England.  At length he ventured to take me behind, by\n",
      "the middle, between his fore-finger and thumb, and brought me within\n",
      "three yards of his eyes, that he might behold my shape more perfectly.  I\n",
      "guessed his meaning, and my good fortune gave me so much presence of\n",
      "mind, that I resolved not to struggle in the least as he held me in the\n",
      "air above sixty feet from the ground, although he grievously pinched my\n",
      "sides, for fear I should slip through his fingers.  All I ventured was to\n",
      "raise mine eyes towards the sun, and place my hands together in a\n",
      "supplicating posture, and to speak some words in a humble melancholy\n",
      "tone, suitable to the condition I then was in: for I apprehended every\n",
      "moment that he would dash me against the ground, as we usually do any\n",
      "little hateful animal, which we have a mind to destroy.  But my good star\n",
      "would have it, that he appeared pleased with my voice and gestures, and\n",
      "began to look upon me as a curiosity, much wondering to hear me pronounce\n",
      "articulate words, although he could not understand them.  In the mean\n",
      "time I was not able to forbear groaning and shedding tears, and turning\n",
      "my head towards my sides; letting him know, as well as I could, how\n",
      "cruelly I was hurt by the pressure of his thumb and finger.  He seemed to\n",
      "apprehend my meaning; for, lifting up the lappet of his coat, he put me\n",
      "gently into it, and immediately ran along with me to his master, who was\n",
      "a substantial farmer, and the same person I had first seen in the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "The farmer having (as I suppose by their talk) received such an account\n",
      "of me as his servant could give him, took a piece of a small straw, about\n",
      "the size of a walking-staff, and therewith lifted up the lappets of my\n",
      "coat; which it seems he thought to be some kind of covering that nature\n",
      "had given me.  He blew my hairs aside to take a better view of my face.\n",
      "He called his hinds about him, and asked them, as I afterwards learned,\n",
      "whether they had ever seen in the fields any little creature that\n",
      "resembled me.  He then placed me softly on the ground upon all fours, but\n",
      "I got immediately up, and walked slowly backward and forward, to let\n",
      "those people see I had no intent to run away.  They all sat down in a\n",
      "circle about me, the better to observe my motions.  I pulled off my hat,\n",
      "and made a low bow towards the farmer.  I fell on my knees, and lifted up\n",
      "my hands and eyes, and spoke several words as loud as I could: I took a\n",
      "purse of gold out of my pocket, and humbly presented it to him.  He\n",
      "received it on the palm of his hand, then applied it close to his eye to\n",
      "see what it was, and afterwards turned it several times with the point of\n",
      "a pin (which he took out of his sleeve,) but could make nothing of it.\n",
      "Whereupon I made a sign that he should place his hand on the ground.  I\n",
      "then took the purse, and, opening it, poured all the gold into his palm.\n",
      "There were six Spanish pieces of four pistoles each, beside twenty or\n",
      "thirty smaller coins.  I saw him wet the tip of his little finger upon\n",
      "his tongue, and take up one of my largest pieces, and then another; but\n",
      "he seemed to be wholly ignorant what they were.  He made me a sign to put\n",
      "them again into my purse, and the purse again into my pocket, which,\n",
      "after offering it to him several times, I thought it best to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "The farmer, by this time, was convinced I must be a rational creature.\n",
      "He spoke often to me; but the sound of his voice pierced my ears like\n",
      "that of a water-mill, yet his words were articulate enough.  I answered\n",
      "as loud as I could in several languages, and he often laid his ear within\n",
      "two yards of me: but all in vain, for we were wholly unintelligible to\n",
      "each other.  He then sent his servants to their work, and taking his\n",
      "handkerchief out of his pocket, he doubled and spread it on his left\n",
      "hand, which he placed flat on the ground with the palm upward, making me\n",
      "a sign to step into it, as I could easily do, for it was not above a foot\n",
      "in thickness.  I thought it my part to obey, and, for fear of falling,\n",
      "laid myself at full length upon the handkerchief, with the remainder of\n",
      "which he lapped me up to the head for further security, and in this\n",
      "manner carried me home to his house.  There he called his wife, and\n",
      "showed me to her; but she screamed and ran back, as women in England do\n",
      "at the sight of a toad or a spider.  However, when she had a while seen\n",
      "my behaviour, and how well I observed the signs her husband made, she was\n",
      "soon reconciled, and by degrees grew extremely tender of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was about twelve at noon, and a servant brought in dinner.  It was\n",
      "only one substantial dish of meat (fit for the plain condition of a\n",
      "husbandman,) in a dish of about four-and-twenty feet diameter.  The\n",
      "company were, the farmer and his wife, three children, and an old\n",
      "grandmother.  When they were sat down, the farmer placed me at some\n",
      "distance from him on the table, which was thirty feet high from the\n",
      "floor.  I was in a terrible fright, and kept as far as I could from the\n",
      "edge, for fear of falling.  The wife minced a bit of meat, then crumbled\n",
      "some bread on a trencher, and placed it before me.  I made her a low bow,\n",
      "took out my knife and fork, and fell to eat, which gave them exceeding\n",
      "delight.  The mistress sent her maid for a small dram cup, which held\n",
      "about two gallons, and filled it with drink; I took up the vessel with\n",
      "much difficulty in both hands, and in a most respectful manner drank to\n",
      "her ladyship’s health, expressing the words as loud as I could in\n",
      "English, which made the company laugh so heartily, that I was almost\n",
      "deafened with the noise.  This liquor tasted like a small cider, and was\n",
      "not unpleasant.  Then the master made me a sign to come to his trencher\n",
      "side; but as I walked on the table, being in great surprise all the time,\n",
      "as the indulgent reader will easily conceive and excuse, I happened to\n",
      "stumble against a crust, and fell flat on my face, but received no hurt.\n",
      "I got up immediately, and observing the good people to be in much\n",
      "concern, I took my hat (which I held under my arm out of good manners,)\n",
      "and waving it over my head, made three huzzas, to show I had got no\n",
      "mischief by my fall.  But advancing forward towards my master (as I shall\n",
      "henceforth call him,) his youngest son, who sat next to him, an arch boy\n",
      "of about ten years old, took me up by the legs, and held me so high in\n",
      "the air, that I trembled every limb: but his father snatched me from him,\n",
      "and at the same time gave him such a box on the left ear, as would have\n",
      "felled an European troop of horse to the earth, ordering him to be taken\n",
      "from the table.  But being afraid the boy might owe me a spite, and well\n",
      "remembering how mischievous all children among us naturally are to\n",
      "sparrows, rabbits, young kittens, and puppy dogs, I fell on my knees, and\n",
      "pointing to the boy, made my master to understand, as well as I could,\n",
      "that I desired his son might be pardoned.  The father complied, and the\n",
      "lad took his seat again, whereupon I went to him, and kissed his hand,\n",
      "which my master took, and made him stroke me gently with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the midst of dinner, my mistress’s favourite cat leaped into her lap.\n",
      "I heard a noise behind me like that of a dozen stocking-weavers at work;\n",
      "and turning my head, I found it proceeded from the purring of that\n",
      "animal, who seemed to be three times larger than an ox, as I computed by\n",
      "the view of her head, and one of her paws, while her mistress was feeding\n",
      "and stroking her.  The fierceness of this creature’s countenance\n",
      "altogether discomposed me; though I stood at the farther end of the\n",
      "table, above fifty feet off; and although my mistress held her fast, for\n",
      "fear she might give a spring, and seize me in her talons.  But it\n",
      "happened there was no danger, for the cat took not the least notice of me\n",
      "when my master placed me within three yards of her.  And as I have been\n",
      "always told, and found true by experience in my travels, that flying or\n",
      "discovering fear before a fierce animal, is a certain way to make it\n",
      "pursue or attack you, so I resolved, in this dangerous juncture, to show\n",
      "no manner of concern.  I walked with intrepidity five or six times before\n",
      "the very head of the cat, and came within half a yard of her; whereupon\n",
      "she drew herself back, as if she were more afraid of me: I had less\n",
      "apprehension concerning the dogs, whereof three or four came into the\n",
      "room, as it is usual in farmers’ houses; one of which was a mastiff,\n",
      "equal in bulk to four elephants, and another a greyhound, somewhat taller\n",
      "than the mastiff, but not so large.\n",
      "\n",
      "When dinner was almost done, the nurse came in with a child of a year old\n",
      "in her arms, who immediately spied me, and began a squall that you might\n",
      "have heard from London-Bridge to Chelsea, after the usual oratory of\n",
      "infants, to get me for a plaything.  The mother, out of pure indulgence,\n",
      "took me up, and put me towards the child, who presently seized me by the\n",
      "middle, and got my head into his mouth, where I roared so loud that the\n",
      "urchin was frighted, and let me drop, and I should infallibly have broke\n",
      "my neck, if the mother had not held her apron under me.  The nurse, to\n",
      "quiet her babe, made use of a rattle which was a kind of hollow vessel\n",
      "filled with great stones, and fastened by a cable to the child’s waist:\n",
      "but all in vain; so that she was forced to apply the last remedy by\n",
      "giving it suck.  I must confess no object ever disgusted me so much as\n",
      "the sight of her monstrous breast, which I cannot tell what to compare\n",
      "with, so as to give the curious reader an idea of its bulk, shape, and\n",
      "colour.  It stood prominent six feet, and could not be less than sixteen\n",
      "in circumference.  The nipple was about half the bigness of my head, and\n",
      "the hue both of that and the dug, so varied with spots, pimples, and\n",
      "freckles, that nothing could appear more nauseous: for I had a near sight\n",
      "of her, she sitting down, the more conveniently to give suck, and I\n",
      "standing on the table.  This made me reflect upon the fair skins of our\n",
      "English ladies, who appear so beautiful to us, only because they are of\n",
      "our own size, and their defects not to be seen but through a magnifying\n",
      "glass; where we find by experiment that the smoothest and whitest skins\n",
      "look rough, and coarse, and ill-coloured.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember when I was at Lilliput, the complexion of those diminutive\n",
      "people appeared to me the fairest in the world; and talking upon this\n",
      "subject with a person of learning there, who was an intimate friend of\n",
      "mine, he said that my face appeared much fairer and smoother when he\n",
      "looked on me from the ground, than it did upon a nearer view, when I took\n",
      "him up in my hand, and brought him close, which he confessed was at first\n",
      "a very shocking sight.  He said, “he could discover great holes in my\n",
      "skin; that the stumps of my beard were ten times stronger than the\n",
      "bristles of a boar, and my complexion made up of several colours\n",
      "altogether disagreeable:” although I must beg leave to say for myself,\n",
      "that I am as fair as most of my sex and country, and very little sunburnt\n",
      "by all my travels.  On the other side, discoursing of the ladies in that\n",
      "emperor’s court, he used to tell me, “one had freckles; another too wide\n",
      "a mouth; a third too large a nose;” nothing of which I was able to\n",
      "distinguish.  I confess this reflection was obvious enough; which,\n",
      "however, I could not forbear, lest the reader might think those vast\n",
      "creatures were actually deformed: for I must do them the justice to say,\n",
      "they are a comely race of people, and particularly the features of my\n",
      "master’s countenance, although he was but a farmer, when I beheld him\n",
      "from the height of sixty feet, appeared very well proportioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "When dinner was done, my master went out to his labourers, and, as I\n",
      "could discover by his voice and gesture, gave his wife strict charge to\n",
      "take care of me.  I was very much tired, and disposed to sleep, which my\n",
      "mistress perceiving, she put me on her own bed, and covered me with a\n",
      "clean white handkerchief, but larger and coarser than the mainsail of a\n",
      "man-of-war.\n",
      "\n",
      "I slept about two hours, and dreamt I was at home with my wife and\n",
      "children, which aggravated my sorrows when I awaked, and found myself\n",
      "alone in a vast room, between two and three hundred feet wide, and above\n",
      "two hundred high, lying in a bed twenty yards wide.  My mistress was gone\n",
      "about her household affairs, and had locked me in.  The bed was eight\n",
      "yards from the floor.  Some natural necessities required me to get down;\n",
      "I durst not presume to call; and if I had, it would have been in vain,\n",
      "with such a voice as mine, at so great a distance from the room where I\n",
      "lay to the kitchen where the family kept.  While I was under these\n",
      "circumstances, two rats crept up the curtains, and ran smelling backwards\n",
      "and forwards on the bed.  One of them came up almost to my face,\n",
      "whereupon I rose in a fright, and drew out my hanger to defend myself.\n",
      "These horrible animals had the boldness to attack me on both sides, and\n",
      "one of them held his fore-feet at my collar; but I had the good fortune\n",
      "to rip up his belly before he could do me any mischief.  He fell down at\n",
      "my feet; and the other, seeing the fate of his comrade, made his escape,\n",
      "but not without one good wound on the back, which I gave him as he fled,\n",
      "and made the blood run trickling from him.  After this exploit, I walked\n",
      "gently to and fro on the bed, to recover my breath and loss of spirits.\n",
      "These creatures were of the size of a large mastiff, but infinitely more\n",
      "nimble and fierce; so that if I had taken off my belt before I went to\n",
      "sleep, I must have infallibly been torn to pieces and devoured.  I\n",
      "measured the tail of the dead rat, and found it to be two yards long,\n",
      "wanting an inch; but it went against my stomach to drag the carcass off\n",
      "the bed, where it lay still bleeding; I observed it had yet some life,\n",
      "but with a strong slash across the neck, I thoroughly despatched it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after my mistress came into the room, who seeing me all bloody, ran\n",
      "and took me up in her hand.  I pointed to the dead rat, smiling, and\n",
      "making other signs to show I was not hurt; whereat she was extremely\n",
      "rejoiced, calling the maid to take up the dead rat with a pair of tongs,\n",
      "and throw it out of the window.  Then she set me on a table, where I\n",
      "showed her my hanger all bloody, and wiping it on the lappet of my coat,\n",
      "returned it to the scabbard.  I was pressed to do more than one thing\n",
      "which another could not do for me, and therefore endeavoured to make my\n",
      "mistress understand, that I desired to be set down on the floor; which\n",
      "after she had done, my bashfulness would not suffer me to express myself\n",
      "farther, than by pointing to the door, and bowing several times.  The\n",
      "good woman, with much difficulty, at last perceived what I would be at,\n",
      "and taking me up again in her hand, walked into the garden, where she set\n",
      "me down.  I went on one side about two hundred yards, and beckoning to\n",
      "her not to look or to follow me, I hid myself between two leaves of\n",
      "sorrel, and there discharged the necessities of nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope the gentle reader will excuse me for dwelling on these and the\n",
      "like particulars, which, however insignificant they may appear to\n",
      "groveling vulgar minds, yet will certainly help a philosopher to enlarge\n",
      "his thoughts and imagination, and apply them to the benefit of public as\n",
      "well as private life, which was my sole design in presenting this and\n",
      "other accounts of my travels to the world; wherein I have been chiefly\n",
      "studious of truth, without affecting any ornaments of learning or of\n",
      "style.  But the whole scene of this voyage made so strong an impression\n",
      "on my mind, and is so deeply fixed in my memory, that, in committing it\n",
      "to paper I did not omit one material circumstance: however, upon a strict\n",
      "review, I blotted out several passages.  Of less moment which were in my\n",
      "first copy, for fear of being censured as tedious and trifling, whereof\n",

      "CHAPTER II.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A description of the farmer’s daughter.  The author carried to a\n",
      "market-town, and then to the metropolis.  The particulars of his journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "My mistress had a daughter of nine years old, a child of towardly parts\n",
      "for her age, very dexterous at her needle, and skilful in dressing her\n",
      "baby.  Her mother and she contrived to fit up the baby’s cradle for me\n",
      "against night: the cradle was put into a small drawer of a cabinet, and\n",
      "the drawer placed upon a hanging shelf for fear of the rats.  This was my\n",
      "bed all the time I staid with those people, though made more convenient\n",
      "by degrees, as I began to learn their language and make my wants known.\n",
      "This young girl was so handy, that after I had once or twice pulled off\n",
      "my clothes before her, she was able to dress and undress me, though I\n",
      "never gave her that trouble when she would let me do either myself.  She\n",
      "made me seven shirts, and some other linen, of as fine cloth as could be\n",
      "got, which indeed was coarser than sackcloth; and these she constantly\n",
      "washed for me with her own hands.  She was likewise my school-mistress,\n",
      "to teach me the language: when I pointed to any thing, she told me the\n",
      "name of it in her own tongue, so that in a few days I was able to call\n",
      "for whatever I had a mind to.  She was very good-natured, and not above\n",
      "forty feet high, being little for her age.  She gave me the name of\n",
      "_Grildrig_, which the family took up, and afterwards the whole kingdom.\n",
      "The word imports what the Latins call _nanunculus_, the Italians\n",
      "_homunceletino_, and the English _mannikin_.  To her I chiefly owe my\n",
      "preservation in that country: we never parted while I was there; I called\n",
      "her my _Glumdalclitch_, or little nurse; and should be guilty of great\n",
      "ingratitude, if I omitted this honourable mention of her care and\n",
      "affection towards me, which I heartily wish it lay in my power to requite\n",
      "as she deserves, instead of being the innocent, but unhappy instrument of\n",
      "her disgrace, as I have too much reason to fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "It now began to be known and talked of in the neighbourhood, that my\n",
      "master had found a strange animal in the field, about the bigness of a\n",
      "_splacnuck_, but exactly shaped in every part like a human creature;\n",
      "which it likewise imitated in all its actions; seemed to speak in a\n",
      "little language of its own, had already learned several words of theirs,\n",
      "went erect upon two legs, was tame and gentle, would come when it was\n",
      "called, do whatever it was bid, had the finest limbs in the world, and a\n",
      "complexion fairer than a nobleman’s daughter of three years old.  Another\n",
      "farmer, who lived hard by, and was a particular friend of my master, came\n",
      "on a visit on purpose to inquire into the truth of this story.  I was\n",
      "immediately produced, and placed upon a table, where I walked as I was\n",
      "commanded, drew my hanger, put it up again, made my reverence to my\n",
      "master’s guest, asked him in his own language how he did, and told him\n",
      "_he was welcome_, just as my little nurse had instructed me.  This man,\n",
      "who was old and dim-sighted, put on his spectacles to behold me better;\n",
      "at which I could not forbear laughing very heartily, for his eyes\n",
      "appeared like the full moon shining into a chamber at two windows.  Our\n",
      "people, who discovered the cause of my mirth, bore me company in\n",
      "laughing, at which the old fellow was fool enough to be angry and out of\n",
      "countenance.  He had the character of a great miser; and, to my\n",
      "misfortune, he well deserved it, by the cursed advice he gave my master,\n",
      "to show me as a sight upon a market-day in the next town, which was half\n",
      "an hour’s riding, about two-and-twenty miles from our house.  I guessed\n",
      "there was some mischief when I observed my master and his friend\n",
      "whispering together, sometimes pointing at me; and my fears made me fancy\n",
      "that I overheard and understood some of their words.  But the next\n",
      "morning Glumdalclitch, my little nurse, told me the whole matter, which\n",
      "she had cunningly picked out from her mother.  The poor girl laid me on\n",
      "her bosom, and fell a weeping with shame and grief.  She apprehended some\n",
      "mischief would happen to me from rude vulgar folks, who might squeeze me\n",
      "to death, or break one of my limbs by taking me in their hands.  She had\n",
      "also observed how modest I was in my nature, how nicely I regarded my\n",
      "honour, and what an indignity I should conceive it, to be exposed for\n",
      "money as a public spectacle, to the meanest of the people.  She said, her\n",
      "papa and mamma had promised that Grildrig should be hers; but now she\n",
      "found they meant to serve her as they did last year, when they pretended\n",
      "to give her a lamb, and yet, as soon as it was fat, sold it to a butcher.\n",
      "For my own part, I may truly affirm, that I was less concerned than my\n",
      "nurse.  I had a strong hope, which never left me, that I should one day\n",
      "recover my liberty: and as to the ignominy of being carried about for a\n",
      "monster, I considered myself to be a perfect stranger in the country, and\n",
      "that such a misfortune could never be charged upon me as a reproach, if\n",
      "ever I should return to England, since the king of Great Britain himself,\n",
      "in my condition, must have undergone the same distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master, pursuant to the advice of his friend, carried me in a box the\n",
      "next market-day to the neighbouring town, and took along with him his\n",
      "little daughter, my nurse, upon a pillion behind him.  The box was close\n",
      "on every side, with a little door for me to go in and out, and a few\n",
      "gimlet holes to let in air.  The girl had been so careful as to put the\n",
      "quilt of her baby’s bed into it, for me to lie down on.  However, I was\n",
      "terribly shaken and discomposed in this journey, though it was but of\n",
      "half an hour: for the horse went about forty feet at every step and\n",
      "trotted so high, that the agitation was equal to the rising and falling\n",
      "of a ship in a great storm, but much more frequent.  Our journey was\n",
      "somewhat farther than from London to St. Alban’s.  My master alighted at\n",
      "an inn which he used to frequent; and after consulting awhile with the\n",
      "inn-keeper, and making some necessary preparations, he hired the\n",
      "_grultrud_, or crier, to give notice through the town of a strange\n",
      "creature to be seen at the sign of the Green Eagle, not so big as a\n",
      "_splacnuck_ (an animal in that country very finely shaped, about six feet\n",
      "long,) and in every part of the body resembling a human creature, could\n",
      "speak several words, and perform a hundred diverting tricks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was placed upon a table in the largest room of the inn, which might be\n",
      "near three hundred feet square.  My little nurse stood on a low stool\n",
      "close to the table, to take care of me, and direct what I should do.  My\n",
      "master, to avoid a crowd, would suffer only thirty people at a time to\n",
      "see me.  I walked about on the table as the girl commanded; she asked me\n",
      "questions, as far as she knew my understanding of the language reached,\n",
      "and I answered them as loud as I could.  I turned about several times to\n",
      "the company, paid my humble respects, said _they were welcome_, and used\n",
      "some other speeches I had been taught.  I took up a thimble filled with\n",
      "liquor, which Glumdalclitch had given me for a cup, and drank their\n",
      "health, I drew out my hanger, and flourished with it after the manner of\n",
      "fencers in England.  My nurse gave me a part of a straw, which I\n",
      "exercised as a pike, having learnt the art in my youth.  I was that day\n",
      "shown to twelve sets of company, and as often forced to act over again\n",
      "the same fopperies, till I was half dead with weariness and vexation; for\n",
      "those who had seen me made such wonderful reports, that the people were\n",
      "ready to break down the doors to come in.  My master, for his own\n",
      "interest, would not suffer any one to touch me except my nurse; and to\n",
      "prevent danger, benches were set round the table at such a distance as to\n",
      "put me out of every body’s reach.  However, an unlucky school-boy aimed a\n",
      "hazel nut directly at my head, which very narrowly missed me; otherwise\n",
      "it came with so much violence, that it would have infallibly knocked out\n",
      "my brains, for it was almost as large as a small pumpkin, but I had the\n",
      "satisfaction to see the young rogue well beaten, and turned out of the\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master gave public notice that he would show me again the next\n",
      "market-day; and in the meantime he prepared a convenient vehicle for me,\n",
      "which he had reason enough to do; for I was so tired with my first\n",
      "journey, and with entertaining company for eight hours together, that I\n",
      "could hardly stand upon my legs, or speak a word.  It was at least three\n",
      "days before I recovered my strength; and that I might have no rest at\n",
      "home, all the neighbouring gentlemen from a hundred miles round, hearing\n",
      "of my fame, came to see me at my master’s own house.  There could not be\n",
      "fewer than thirty persons with their wives and children (for the country\n",
      "is very populous;) and my master demanded the rate of a full room\n",
      "whenever he showed me at home, although it were only to a single family;\n",
      "so that for some time I had but little ease every day of the week (except\n",
      "Wednesday, which is their Sabbath,) although I were not carried to the\n",
      "town.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master, finding how profitable I was likely to be, resolved to carry\n",
      "me to the most considerable cities of the kingdom.  Having therefore\n",
      "provided himself with all things necessary for a long journey, and\n",
      "settled his affairs at home, he took leave of his wife, and upon the 17th\n",
      "of August, 1703, about two months after my arrival, we set out for the\n",
      "metropolis, situate near the middle of that empire, and about three\n",
      "thousand miles distance from our house.  My master made his daughter\n",
      "Glumdalclitch ride behind him.  She carried me on her lap, in a box tied\n",
      "about her waist.  The girl had lined it on all sides with the softest\n",
      "cloth she could get, well quilted underneath, furnished it with her\n",
      "baby’s bed, provided me with linen and other necessaries, and made\n",
      "everything as convenient as she could.  We had no other company but a boy\n",
      "of the house, who rode after us with the luggage.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master’s design was to show me in all the towns by the way, and to\n",
      "step out of the road for fifty or a hundred miles, to any village, or\n",
      "person of quality’s house, where he might expect custom.  We made easy\n",
      "journeys, of not above seven or eight score miles a-day; for\n",
      "Glumdalclitch, on purpose to spare me, complained she was tired with the\n",
      "trotting of the horse.  She often took me out of my box, at my own\n",
      "desire, to give me air, and show me the country, but always held me fast\n",
      "by a leading-string.  We passed over five or six rivers, many degrees\n",
      "broader and deeper than the Nile or the Ganges: and there was hardly a\n",
      "rivulet so small as the Thames at London-bridge.  We were ten weeks in\n",
      "our journey, and I was shown in eighteen large towns, besides many\n",
      "villages, and private families.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the 26th day of October we arrived at the metropolis, called in their\n",
      "language _Lorbrulgrud_, or Pride of the Universe.  My master took a\n",
      "lodging in the principal street of the city, not far from the royal\n",
      "palace, and put out bills in the usual form, containing an exact\n",
      "description of my person and parts.  He hired a large room between three\n",
      "and four hundred feet wide.  He provided a table sixty feet in diameter,\n",
      "upon which I was to act my part, and pallisadoed it round three feet from\n",
      "the edge, and as many high, to prevent my falling over.  I was shown ten\n",
      "times a-day, to the wonder and satisfaction of all people.  I could now\n",
      "speak the language tolerably well, and perfectly understood every word,\n",
      "that was spoken to me.  Besides, I had learnt their alphabet, and could\n",
      "make a shift to explain a sentence here and there; for Glumdalclitch had\n",
      "been my instructor while we were at home, and at leisure hours during our\n",
      "journey.  She carried a little book in her pocket, not much larger than a\n",
      "Sanson’s Atlas; it was a common treatise for the use of young girls,\n",
      "giving a short account of their religion: out of this she taught me my\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The author sent for to court.  The queen buys him of his master the\n",
      "farmer, and presents him to the king.  He disputes with his majesty’s\n",
      "great scholars.  An apartment at court provided for the author.  He is in\n",
      "high favour with the queen.  He stands up for the honour of his own\n",
      "country.  His quarrels with the queen’s dwarf.\n",
      "\n",
      "The frequent labours I underwent every day, made, in a few weeks, a very\n",
      "considerable change in my health: the more my master got by me, the more\n",
      "insatiable he grew.  I had quite lost my stomach, and was almost reduced\n",
      "to a skeleton.  The farmer observed it, and concluding I must soon die,\n",
      "resolved to make as good a hand of me as he could.  While he was thus\n",
      "reasoning and resolving with himself, a _sardral_, or gentleman-usher,\n",
      "came from court, commanding my master to carry me immediately thither for\n",
      "the diversion of the queen and her ladies.  Some of the latter had\n",
      "already been to see me, and reported strange things of my beauty,\n",
      "behaviour, and good sense.  Her majesty, and those who attended her, were\n",
      "beyond measure delighted with my demeanour.  I fell on my knees, and\n",
      "begged the honour of kissing her imperial foot; but this gracious\n",
      "princess held out her little finger towards me, after I was set on the\n",
      "table, which I embraced in both my arms, and put the tip of it with the\n",
      "utmost respect to my lip.  She made me some general questions about my\n",
      "country and my travels, which I answered as distinctly, and in as few\n",
      "words as I could.  She asked, “whether I could be content to live at\n",
      "court?”  I bowed down to the board of the table, and humbly answered\n",
      "“that I was my master’s slave: but, if I were at my own disposal, I\n",
      "should be proud to devote my life to her majesty’s service.”  She then\n",
      "asked my master, “whether he was willing to sell me at a good price?”\n",
      "He, who apprehended I could not live a month, was ready enough to part\n",
      "with me, and demanded a thousand pieces of gold, which were ordered him\n",
      "on the spot, each piece being about the bigness of eight hundred\n",
      "moidores; but allowing for the proportion of all things between that\n",
      "country and Europe, and the high price of gold among them, was hardly so\n",
      "great a sum as a thousand guineas would be in England.  I then said to\n",
      "the queen, “since I was now her majesty’s most humble creature and\n",
      "vassal, I must beg the favour, that Glumdalclitch, who had always tended\n",
      "me with so much care and kindness, and understood to do it so well, might\n",
      "be admitted into her service, and continue to be my nurse and\n",
      "instructor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her majesty agreed to my petition, and easily got the farmer’s consent,\n",
      "who was glad enough to have his daughter preferred at court, and the poor\n",
      "girl herself was not able to hide her joy.  My late master withdrew,\n",
      "bidding me farewell, and saying he had left me in a good service; to\n",
      "which I replied not a word, only making him a slight bow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The queen observed my coldness; and, when the farmer was gone out of the\n",
      "apartment, asked me the reason.  I made bold to tell her majesty, “that I\n",
      "owed no other obligation to my late master, than his not dashing out the\n",
      "brains of a poor harmless creature, found by chance in his fields: which\n",
      "obligation was amply recompensed, by the gain he had made in showing me\n",
      "through half the kingdom, and the price he had now sold me for.  That the\n",
      "life I had since led was laborious enough to kill an animal of ten times\n",
      "my strength.  That my health was much impaired, by the continual drudgery\n",
      "of entertaining the rabble every hour of the day; and that, if my master\n",
      "had not thought my life in danger, her majesty would not have got so\n",
      "cheap a bargain.  But as I was out of all fear of being ill-treated under\n",
      "the protection of so great and good an empress, the ornament of nature,\n",
      "the darling of the world, the delight of her subjects, the phoenix of the\n",
      "creation, so I hoped my late master’s apprehensions would appear to be\n",
      "groundless; for I already found my spirits revive, by the influence of\n",
      "her most august presence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the sum of my speech, delivered with great improprieties and\n",
      "hesitation.  The latter part was altogether framed in the style peculiar\n",
      "to that people, whereof I learned some phrases from Glumdalclitch, while\n",
      "she was carrying me to court.\n",
      "\n",
      "The queen, giving great allowance for my defectiveness in speaking, was,\n",
      "however, surprised at so much wit and good sense in so diminutive an\n",
      "animal.  She took me in her own hand, and carried me to the king, who was\n",
      "then retired to his cabinet.  His majesty, a prince of much gravity and\n",
      "austere countenance, not well observing my shape at first view, asked the\n",
      "queen after a cold manner “how long it was since she grew fond of a\n",
      "_splacnuck_?” for such it seems he took me to be, as I lay upon my breast\n",
      "in her majesty’s right hand.  But this princess, who has an infinite deal\n",
      "of wit and humour, set me gently on my feet upon the scrutoire, and\n",
      "commanded me to give his majesty an account of myself, which I did in a\n",
      "very few words: and Glumdalclitch who attended at the cabinet door, and\n",
      "could not endure I should be out of her sight, being admitted, confirmed\n",
      "all that had passed from my arrival at her father’s house.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king, although he be as learned a person as any in his dominions, had\n",
      "been educated in the study of philosophy, and particularly mathematics;\n",
      "yet when he observed my shape exactly, and saw me walk erect, before I\n",
      "began to speak, conceived I might be a piece of clock-work (which is in\n",
      "that country arrived to a very great perfection) contrived by some\n",
      "ingenious artist.  But when he heard my voice, and found what I delivered\n",
      "to be regular and rational, he could not conceal his astonishment.  He\n",
      "was by no means satisfied with the relation I gave him of the manner I\n",
      "came into his kingdom, but thought it a story concerted between\n",
      "Glumdalclitch and her father, who had taught me a set of words to make me\n",
      "sell at a better price.  Upon this imagination, he put several other\n",
      "questions to me, and still received rational answers: no otherwise\n",
      "defective than by a foreign accent, and an imperfect knowledge in the\n",
      "language, with some rustic phrases which I had learned at the farmer’s\n",
      "house, and did not suit the polite style of a court.\n",
      "\n",
      "His majesty sent for three great scholars, who were then in their weekly\n",
      "waiting, according to the custom in that country.  These gentlemen, after\n",
      "they had a while examined my shape with much nicety, were of different\n",
      "opinions concerning me.  They all agreed that I could not be produced\n",
      "according to the regular laws of nature, because I was not framed with a\n",
      "capacity of preserving my life, either by swiftness, or climbing of\n",
      "trees, or digging holes in the earth.  They observed by my teeth, which\n",
      "they viewed with great exactness, that I was a carnivorous animal; yet\n",
      "most quadrupeds being an overmatch for me, and field mice, with some\n",
      "others, too nimble, they could not imagine how I should be able to\n",
      "support myself, unless I fed upon snails and other insects, which they\n",
      "offered, by many learned arguments, to evince that I could not possibly\n",
      "do.  One of these virtuosi seemed to think that I might be an embryo, or\n",
      "abortive birth.  But this opinion was rejected by the other two, who\n",
      "observed my limbs to be perfect and finished; and that I had lived\n",
      "several years, as it was manifest from my beard, the stumps whereof they\n",
      "plainly discovered through a magnifying glass.  They would not allow me\n",
      "to be a dwarf, because my littleness was beyond all degrees of\n",
      "comparison; for the queen’s favourite dwarf, the smallest ever known in\n",
      "that kingdom, was near thirty feet high.  After much debate, they\n",
      "concluded unanimously, that I was only _relplum scalcath_, which is\n",
      "interpreted literally _lusus naturæ_; a determination exactly agreeable\n",
      "to the modern philosophy of Europe, whose professors, disdaining the old\n",
      "evasion of occult causes, whereby the followers of Aristotle endeavoured\n",
      "in vain to disguise their ignorance, have invented this wonderful\n",
      "solution of all difficulties, to the unspeakable advancement of human\n",
      "knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this decisive conclusion, I entreated to be heard a word or two.  I\n",
      "applied myself to the king, and assured his majesty, “that I came from a\n",
      "country which abounded with several millions of both sexes, and of my own\n",
      "stature; where the animals, trees, and houses, were all in proportion,\n",
      "and where, by consequence, I might be as able to defend myself, and to\n",
      "find sustenance, as any of his majesty’s subjects could do here; which I\n",
      "took for a full answer to those gentlemen’s arguments.”  To this they\n",
      "only replied with a smile of contempt, saying, “that the farmer had\n",
      "instructed me very well in my lesson.”  The king, who had a much better\n",
      "understanding, dismissing his learned men, sent for the farmer, who by\n",
      "good fortune was not yet gone out of town.  Having therefore first\n",
      "examined him privately, and then confronted him with me and the young\n",
      "girl, his majesty began to think that what we told him might possibly be\n",
      "true. He desired the queen to order that a particular care should be\n",
      "taken of me; and was of opinion that Glumdalclitch should still continue\n",
      "in her office of tending me, because he observed we had a great affection\n",
      "for each other.  A convenient apartment was provided for her at court:\n",
      "she had a sort of governess appointed to take care of her education, a\n",
      "maid to dress her, and two other servants for menial offices; but the\n",
      "care of me was wholly appropriated to herself.  The queen commanded her\n",
      "own cabinet-maker to contrive a box, that might serve me for a\n",
      "bedchamber, after the model that Glumdalclitch and I should agree upon.\n",
      "This man was a most ingenious artist, and according to my direction, in\n",
      "three weeks finished for me a wooden chamber of sixteen feet square, and\n",
      "twelve high, with sash-windows, a door, and two closets, like a London\n",
      "bed-chamber.  The board, that made the ceiling, was to be lifted up and\n",
      "down by two hinges, to put in a bed ready furnished by her majesty’s\n",
      "upholsterer, which Glumdalclitch took out every day to air, made it with\n",
      "her own hands, and letting it down at night, locked up the roof over me.\n",
      "A nice workman, who was famous for little curiosities, undertook to make\n",
      "me two chairs, with backs and frames, of a substance not unlike ivory,\n",
      "and two tables, with a cabinet to put my things in.  The room was quilted\n",
      "on all sides, as well as the floor and the ceiling, to prevent any\n",
      "accident from the carelessness of those who carried me, and to break the\n",
      "force of a jolt, when I went in a coach.  I desired a lock for my door,\n",
      "to prevent rats and mice from coming in.  The smith, after several\n",
      "attempts, made the smallest that ever was seen among them, for I have\n",
      "known a larger at the gate of a gentleman’s house in England.  I made a\n",
      "shift to keep the key in a pocket of my own, fearing Glumdalclitch might\n",
      "lose it.  The queen likewise ordered the thinnest silks that could be\n",
      "gotten, to make me clothes, not much thicker than an English blanket,\n",
      "very cumbersome till I was accustomed to them.  They were after the\n",
      "fashion of the kingdom, partly resembling the Persian, and partly the\n",
      "Chinese, and are a very grave and decent habit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The queen became so fond of my company, that she could not dine without\n",
      "me.  I had a table placed upon the same at which her majesty ate, just at\n",
      "her left elbow, and a chair to sit on.  Glumdalclitch stood on a stool on\n",
      "the floor near my table, to assist and take care of me.  I had an entire\n",
      "set of silver dishes and plates, and other necessaries, which, in\n",
      "proportion to those of the queen, were not much bigger than what I have\n",
      "seen in a London toy-shop for the furniture of a baby-house: these my\n",
      "little nurse kept in her pocket in a silver box, and gave me at meals as\n",
      "I wanted them, always cleaning them herself.  No person dined with the\n",
      "queen but the two princesses royal, the eldest sixteen years old, and the\n",
      "younger at that time thirteen and a month.  Her majesty used to put a bit\n",
      "of meat upon one of my dishes, out of which I carved for myself, and her\n",
      "diversion was to see me eat in miniature: for the queen (who had indeed\n",
      "but a weak stomach) took up, at one mouthful, as much as a dozen English\n",
      "farmers could eat at a meal, which to me was for some time a very\n",
      "nauseous sight.  She would craunch the wing of a lark, bones and all,\n",
      "between her teeth, although it were nine times as large as that of a\n",
      "full-grown turkey; and put a bit of bread into her mouth as big as two\n",
      "twelve-penny loaves.  She drank out of a golden cup, above a hogshead at\n",
      "a draught.  Her knives were twice as long as a scythe, set straight upon\n",
      "the handle.  The spoons, forks, and other instruments, were all in the\n",
      "same proportion.  I remember when Glumdalclitch carried me, out of\n",
      "curiosity, to see some of the tables at court, where ten or a dozen of\n",
      "those enormous knives and forks were lifted up together, I thought I had\n",
      "never till then beheld so terrible a sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the custom, that every Wednesday (which, as I have observed, is\n",
      "their Sabbath) the king and queen, with the royal issue of both sexes,\n",
      "dine together in the apartment of his majesty, to whom I was now become a\n",
      "great favourite; and at these times, my little chair and table were\n",
      "placed at his left hand, before one of the salt-cellars.  This prince\n",
      "took a pleasure in conversing with me, inquiring into the manners,\n",
      "religion, laws, government, and learning of Europe; wherein I gave him\n",
      "the best account I was able.  His apprehension was so clear, and his\n",
      "judgment so exact, that he made very wise reflections and observations\n",
      "upon all I said.  But I confess, that, after I had been a little too\n",
      "copious in talking of my own beloved country, of our trade and wars by\n",
      "sea and land, of our schisms in religion, and parties in the state; the\n",
      "prejudices of his education prevailed so far, that he could not forbear\n",
      "taking me up in his right hand, and stroking me gently with the other,\n",
      "after a hearty fit of laughing, asked me, “whether I was a whig or tory?”\n",
      "Then turning to his first minister, who waited behind him with a white\n",
      "staff, near as tall as the mainmast of the Royal Sovereign, he observed\n",
      "“how contemptible a thing was human grandeur, which could be mimicked by\n",
      "such diminutive insects as I: and yet,” says he, “I dare engage these\n",
      "creatures have their titles and distinctions of honour; they contrive\n",
      "little nests and burrows, that they call houses and cities; they make a\n",
      "figure in dress and equipage; they love, they fight, they dispute, they\n",
      "cheat, they betray!”  And thus he continued on, while my colour came and\n",
      "went several times, with indignation, to hear our noble country, the\n",
      "mistress of arts and arms, the scourge of France, the arbitress of\n",
      "Europe, the seat of virtue, piety, honour, and truth, the pride and envy\n",
      "of the world, so contemptuously treated.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as I was not in a condition to resent injuries, so upon mature\n",
      "thoughts I began to doubt whether I was injured or no.  For, after having\n",
      "been accustomed several months to the sight and converse of this people,\n",
      "and observed every object upon which I cast mine eyes to be of\n",
      "proportionable magnitude, the horror I had at first conceived from their\n",
      "bulk and aspect was so far worn off, that if I had then beheld a company\n",
      "of English lords and ladies in their finery and birth-day clothes, acting\n",
      "their several parts in the most courtly manner of strutting, and bowing,\n",
      "and prating, to say the truth, I should have been strongly tempted to\n",
      "laugh as much at them as the king and his grandees did at me.  Neither,\n",
      "indeed, could I forbear smiling at myself, when the queen used to place\n",
      "me upon her hand towards a looking-glass, by which both our persons\n",
      "appeared before me in full view together; and there could be nothing more\n",
      "ridiculous than the comparison; so that I really began to imagine myself\n",
      "dwindled many degrees below my usual size.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing angered and mortified me so much as the queen’s dwarf; who being\n",
      "of the lowest stature that was ever in that country (for I verily think\n",
      "he was not full thirty feet high), became so insolent at seeing a\n",
      "creature so much beneath him, that he would always affect to swagger and\n",
      "look big as he passed by me in the queen’s antechamber, while I was\n",
      "standing on some table talking with the lords or ladies of the court, and\n",
      "he seldom failed of a smart word or two upon my littleness; against which\n",
      "I could only revenge myself by calling him brother, challenging him to\n",
      "wrestle, and such repartees as are usually in the mouths of court pages.\n",
      "One day, at dinner, this malicious little cub was so nettled with\n",
      "something I had said to him, that, raising himself upon the frame of her\n",
      "majesty’s chair, he took me up by the middle, as I was sitting down, not\n",
      "thinking any harm, and let me drop into a large silver bowl of cream, and\n",
      "then ran away as fast as he could.  I fell over head and ears, and, if I\n",
      "had not been a good swimmer, it might have gone very hard with me; for\n",
      "Glumdalclitch in that instant happened to be at the other end of the\n",
      "room, and the queen was in such a fright, that she wanted presence of\n",
      "mind to assist me.  But my little nurse ran to my relief, and took me\n",
      "out, after I had swallowed above a quart of cream.  I was put to bed:\n",
      "however, I received no other damage than the loss of a suit of clothes,\n",
      "which was utterly spoiled.  The dwarf was soundly whipt, and as a farther\n",
      "punishment, forced to drink up the bowl of cream into which he had thrown\n",
      "me: neither was he ever restored to favour; for soon after the queen\n",
      "bestowed him on a lady of high quality, so that I saw him no more, to my\n",
      "very great satisfaction; for I could not tell to what extremities such a\n",
      "malicious urchin might have carried his resentment.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had before served me a scurvy trick, which set the queen a-laughing,\n",
      "although at the same time she was heartily vexed, and would have\n",
      "immediately cashiered him, if I had not been so generous as to intercede.\n",
      "Her majesty had taken a marrow-bone upon her plate, and, after knocking\n",
      "out the marrow, placed the bone again in the dish erect, as it stood\n",
      "before; the dwarf, watching his opportunity, while Glumdalclitch was gone\n",
      "to the side-board, mounted the stool that she stood on to take care of me\n",
      "at meals, took me up in both hands, and squeezing my legs together,\n",
      "wedged them into the marrow bone above my waist, where I stuck for some\n",
      "time, and made a very ridiculous figure.  I believe it was near a minute\n",
      "before any one knew what was become of me; for I thought it below me to\n",
      "cry out.  But, as princes seldom get their meat hot, my legs were not\n",
      "scalded, only my stockings and breeches in a sad condition.  The dwarf,\n",
      "at my entreaty, had no other punishment than a sound whipping.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was frequently rallied by the queen upon account of my fearfulness; and\n",
      "she used to ask me whether the people of my country were as great cowards\n",
      "as myself?  The occasion was this: the kingdom is much pestered with\n",
      "flies in summer; and these odious insects, each of them as big as a\n",
      "Dunstable lark, hardly gave me any rest while I sat at dinner, with their\n",
      "continual humming and buzzing about mine ears.  They would sometimes\n",
      "alight upon my victuals, and leave their loathsome excrement, or spawn\n",
      "behind, which to me was very visible, though not to the natives of that\n",
      "country, whose large optics were not so acute as mine, in viewing smaller\n",
      "objects.  Sometimes they would fix upon my nose, or forehead, where they\n",
      "stung me to the quick, smelling very offensively; and I could easily\n",
      "trace that viscous matter, which, our naturalists tell us, enables those\n",
      "creatures to walk with their feet upwards upon a ceiling.  I had much ado\n",
      "to defend myself against these detestable animals, and could not forbear\n",
      "starting when they came on my face.  It was the common practice of the\n",
      "dwarf, to catch a number of these insects in his hand, as schoolboys do\n",
      "among us, and let them out suddenly under my nose, on purpose to frighten\n",
      "me, and divert the queen.  My remedy was to cut them in pieces with my\n",
      "knife, as they flew in the air, wherein my dexterity was much admired.\n",

      "of the volcanoes upon the tops: neither do the most learned know what\n",

      "their boats; so that these people are wholly excluded from any commerce\n",
      "with the rest of the world.  But the large rivers are full of vessels,\n",
      "and abound with excellent fish; for they seldom get any from the sea,\n",
      "because the sea fish are of the same size with those in Europe, and\n",
      "consequently not worth catching; whereby it is manifest, that nature, in\n",
      "the production of plants and animals of so extraordinary a bulk, is\n",

      "stands upon almost two equal parts, on each side the river that passes\n",
      "through.  It contains above eighty thousand houses, and about six hundred\n",
      "thousand inhabitants.  It is in length three _glomglungs_ (which make\n",
      "about fifty-four English miles,) and two and a half in breadth; as I\n",
      "measured it myself in the royal map made by the king’s order, which was\n",
      "laid on the ground on purpose for me, and extended a hundred feet: I\n",

      "The king’s palace is no regular edifice, but a heap of buildings, about\n",
      "seven miles round: the chief rooms are generally two hundred and forty\n",

      "me out, and hold me in her hand, that I might more conveniently view the\n",
      "houses and the people, as we passed along the streets.  I reckoned our\n",
      "coach to be about a square of Westminster-hall, but not altogether so\n",
      "high: however, I cannot be very exact.  One day the governess ordered our\n",
      "coachman to stop at several shops, where the beggars, watching their\n",
      "opportunity, crowded to the sides of the coach, and gave me the most\n",
      "horrible spectacle that ever a European eye beheld.  There was a woman\n",
      "with a cancer in her breast, swelled to a monstrous size, full of holes,\n",
      "in two or three of which I could have easily crept, and covered my whole\n",
      "body.  There was a fellow with a wen in his neck, larger than five\n",
      "wool-packs; and another, with a couple of wooden legs, each about twenty\n",
      "feet high.  But the most hateful sight of all, was the lice crawling on\n",
      "their clothes.  I could see distinctly the limbs of these vermin with my\n",
      "naked eye, much better than those of a European louse through a\n",
      "microscope, and their snouts with which they rooted like swine.  They\n",
      "were the first I had ever beheld, and I should have been curious enough\n",
      "to dissect one of them, if I had had proper instruments, which I\n",

      "nauseous, that it perfectly turned my stomach.\n",

      "Besides the large box in which I was usually carried, the queen ordered a\n",
      "smaller one to be made for me, of about twelve feet square, and ten high,\n",
      "for the convenience of travelling; because the other was somewhat too\n",
      "large for Glumdalclitch’s lap, and cumbersome in the coach; it was made\n",
      "by the same artist, whom I directed in the whole contrivance.  This\n",
      "travelling-closet was an exact square, with a window in the middle of\n",
      "three of the squares, and each window was latticed with iron wire on the\n",
      "outside, to prevent accidents in long journeys.  On the fourth side,\n",
      "which had no window, two strong staples were fixed, through which the\n",
      "person that carried me, when I had a mind to be on horseback, put a\n",
      "leathern belt, and buckled it about his waist.  This was always the\n",
      "office of some grave trusty servant, in whom I could confide, whether I\n",
      "attended the king and queen in their progresses, or were disposed to see\n",
      "the gardens, or pay a visit to some great lady or minister of state in\n",
      "the court, when Glumdalclitch happened to be out of order; for I soon\n",
      "began to be known and esteemed among the greatest officers, I suppose\n",
      "more upon account of their majesties’ favour, than any merit of my own.\n",
      "In journeys, when I was weary of the coach, a servant on horseback would\n",
      "buckle on my box, and place it upon a cushion before him; and there I had\n",
      "a full prospect of the country on three sides, from my three windows.  I\n",
      "had, in this closet, a field-bed and a hammock, hung from the ceiling,\n",
      "two chairs and a table, neatly screwed to the floor, to prevent being\n",
      "tossed about by the agitation of the horse or the coach.  And having been\n",
      "long used to sea-voyages, those motions, although sometimes very violent,\n",
      "did not much discompose me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever I had a mind to see the town, it was always in my\n",
      "travelling-closet; which Glumdalclitch held in her lap in a kind of open\n",
      "sedan, after the fashion of the country, borne by four men, and attended\n",
      "by two others in the queen’s livery.  The people, who had often heard of\n",
      "me, were very curious to crowd about the sedan, and the girl was\n",
      "complaisant enough to make the bearers stop, and to take me in her hand,\n",
      "that I might be more conveniently seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was very desirous to see the chief temple, and particularly the tower\n",
      "belonging to it, which is reckoned the highest in the kingdom.\n",
      "Accordingly one day my nurse carried me thither, but I may truly say I\n",
      "came back disappointed; for the height is not above three thousand feet,\n",
      "reckoning from the ground to the highest pinnacle top; which, allowing\n",
      "for the difference between the size of those people and us in Europe, is\n",
      "no great matter for admiration, nor at all equal in proportion (if I\n",
      "rightly remember) to Salisbury steeple.  But, not to detract from a\n",
      "nation, to which, during my life, I shall acknowledge myself extremely\n",
      "obliged, it must be allowed, that whatever this famous tower wants in\n",
      "height, is amply made up in beauty and strength: for the walls are near a\n",
      "hundred feet thick, built of hewn stone, whereof each is about forty feet\n",
      "square, and adorned on all sides with statues of gods and emperors, cut\n",
      "in marble, larger than the life, placed in their several niches.  I\n",
      "measured a little finger which had fallen down from one of these statues,\n",
      "and lay unperceived among some rubbish, and found it exactly four feet\n",
      "and an inch in length.  Glumdalclitch wrapped it up in her handkerchief,\n",
      "and carried it home in her pocket, to keep among other trinkets, of which\n",
      "the girl was very fond, as children at her age usually are.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king’s kitchen is indeed a noble building, vaulted at top, and about\n",
      "six hundred feet high.  The great oven is not so wide, by ten paces, as\n",
      "the cupola at St. Paul’s: for I measured the latter on purpose, after my\n",
      "return.  But if I should describe the kitchen grate, the prodigious pots\n",
      "and kettles, the joints of meat turning on the spits, with many other\n",
      "particulars, perhaps I should be hardly believed; at least a severe\n",
      "critic would be apt to think I enlarged a little, as travellers are often\n",
      "suspected to do.  To avoid which censure I fear I have run too much into\n",
      "the other extreme; and that if this treatise should happen to be\n",
      "translated into the language of Brobdingnag (which is the general name of\n",
      "that kingdom,) and transmitted thither, the king and his people would\n",

      "meantime, there suddenly fell such a violent shower of hail, that I was\n",
      "immediately by the force of it, struck to the ground: and when I was\n",
      "down, the hailstones gave me such cruel bangs all over the body, as if I\n",

      "all fours, and shelter myself, by lying flat on my face, on the lee-side\n",
      "of a border of lemon-thyme, but so bruised from head to foot, that I\n",
      "could not go abroad in ten days.  Neither is this at all to be wondered\n",
      "at, because nature, in that country, observing the same proportion\n",
      "through all her operations, a hailstone is near eighteen hundred times as\n",
      "large as one in Europe; which I can assert upon experience, having been\n",
      "so curious as to weigh and measure them.\n",

      "While she was absent, and out of hearing, a small white spaniel that\n",
      "belonged to one of the chief gardeners, having got by accident into the\n",
      "garden, happened to range near the place where I lay: the dog, following\n",
      "the scent, came directly up, and taking me in his mouth, ran straight to\n",
      "his master wagging his tail, and set me gently on the ground.  By good\n",
      "fortune he had been so well taught, that I was carried between his teeth\n",
      "without the least hurt, or even tearing my clothes.  But the poor\n",
      "gardener, who knew me well, and had a great kindness for me, was in a\n",
      "terrible fright: he gently took me up in both his hands, and asked me how\n",
      "I did? but I was so amazed and out of breath, that I could not speak a\n",
      "word.  In a few minutes I came to myself, and he carried me safe to my\n",
      "little nurse, who, by this time, had returned to the place where she left\n",
      "me, and was in cruel agonies when I did not appear, nor answer when she\n",
      "called.  She severely reprimanded the gardener on account of his dog.\n",
      "But the thing was hushed up, and never known at court, for the girl was\n",
      "afraid of the queen’s anger; and truly, as to myself, I thought it would\n",

      "\n",
      "This accident absolutely determined Glumdalclitch never to trust me\n",

      "resolution, and therefore concealed from her some little unlucky\n",
      "adventures, that happened in those times when I was left by myself.  Once\n",
      "a kite, hovering over the garden, made a stoop at me, and if I had not\n",
      "resolutely drawn my hanger, and run under a thick espalier, he would have\n",
      "certainly carried me away in his talons.  Another time, walking to the\n",
      "top of a fresh mole-hill, I fell to my neck in the hole, through which\n",
      "that animal had cast up the earth, and coined some lie, not worth\n",
      "remembering, to excuse myself for spoiling my clothes.  I likewise broke\n",
      "my right shin against the shell of a snail, which I happened to stumble\n",
      "over, as I was walking alone and thinking on poor England.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot tell whether I were more pleased or mortified to observe, in\n",
      "those solitary walks, that the smaller birds did not appear to be at all\n",
      "afraid of me, but would hop about within a yard’s distance, looking for\n",
      "worms and other food, with as much indifference and security as if no\n",
      "creature at all were near them.  I remember, a thrush had the confidence\n",
      "to snatch out of my hand, with his bill, a of cake that Glumdalclitch had\n",
      "just given me for my breakfast.  When I attempted to catch any of these\n",
      "birds, they would boldly turn against me, endeavouring to peck my\n",
      "fingers, which I durst not venture within their reach; and then they\n",
      "would hop back unconcerned, to hunt for worms or snails, as they did\n",
      "before.  But one day, I took a thick cudgel, and threw it with all my\n",
      "strength so luckily, at a linnet, that I knocked him down, and seizing\n",
      "him by the neck with both my hands, ran with him in triumph to my nurse.\n",
      "However, the bird, who had only been stunned, recovering himself gave me\n",
      "so many boxes with his wings, on both sides of my head and body, though I\n",
      "held him at arm’s-length, and was out of the reach of his claws, that I\n",
      "was twenty times thinking to let him go.  But I was soon relieved by one\n",
      "of our servants, who wrung off the bird’s neck, and I had him next day\n",
      "for dinner, by the queen’s command.  This linnet, as near as I can\n",
      "remember, seemed to be somewhat larger than an English swan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The maids of honour often invited Glumdalclitch to their apartments, and\n",
      "desired she would bring me along with her, on purpose to have the\n",
      "pleasure of seeing and touching me.  They would often strip me naked from\n",
      "top to toe, and lay me at full length in their bosoms; wherewith I was\n",
      "much disgusted because, to say the truth, a very offensive smell came\n",
      "from their skins; which I do not mention, or intend, to the disadvantage\n",
      "of those excellent ladies, for whom I have all manner of respect; but I\n",

      "or to each other, than people of the same quality are with us in England.\n",
      "And, after all, I found their natural smell was much more supportable,\n",
      "than when they used perfumes, under which I immediately swooned away.  I\n",

      "freedom in a warm day, when I had used a good deal of exercise, to\n",
      "complain of a strong smell about me, although I am as little faulty that\n",
      "way, as most of my sex: but I suppose his faculty of smelling was as nice\n",

      "I cannot forbear doing justice to the queen my mistress, and\n",

      "\n",
      "That which gave me most uneasiness among these maids of honour (when my\n",

      "they would strip themselves to the skin, and put on their smocks in my\n",
      "presence, while I was placed on their toilet, directly before their naked\n",
      "bodies, which I am sure to me was very far from being a tempting sight,\n",
      "or from giving me any other emotions than those of horror and disgust:\n",

      "hairs hanging from it thicker than packthreads, to say nothing farther\n",
      "concerning the rest of their persons.  Neither did they at all scruple,\n",
      "while I was by, to discharge what they had drank, to the quantity of at\n",

      "sixteen, would sometimes set me astride upon one of her nipples, with\n",
      "many other tricks, wherein the reader will excuse me for not being over\n",

      "One day, a young gentleman, who was nephew to my nurse’s governess, came\n",
      "and pressed them both to see an execution.  It was of a man, who had\n",
      "murdered one of that gentleman’s intimate acquaintance.  Glumdalclitch\n",
      "was prevailed on to be of the company, very much against her inclination,\n",
      "for she was naturally tender-hearted: and, as for myself, although I\n",
      "abhorred such kind of spectacles, yet my curiosity tempted me to see\n",
      "something that I thought must be extraordinary.  The malefactor was fixed\n",
      "in a chair upon a scaffold erected for that purpose, and his head cut off\n",
      "at one blow, with a sword of about forty feet long.  The veins and\n",

      "gave such a bounce as made me start, although I was at least half an\n",
      "English mile distant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The queen, who often used to hear me talk of my sea-voyages, and took all\n",
      "occasions to divert me when I was melancholy, asked me whether I\n",
      "understood how to handle a sail or an oar, and whether a little exercise\n",
      "of rowing might not be convenient for my health?  I answered, that I\n",
      "understood both very well: for although my proper employment had been to\n",
      "be surgeon or doctor to the ship, yet often, upon a pinch, I was forced\n",
      "to work like a common mariner.  But I could not see how this could be\n",
      "done in their country, where the smallest wherry was equal to a\n",
      "first-rate man of war among us; and such a boat as I could manage would\n",
      "never live in any of their rivers.  Her majesty said, if I would contrive\n",
      "a boat, her own joiner should make it, and she would provide a place for\n",
      "me to sail in.  The fellow was an ingenious workman, and by my\n",
      "instructions, in ten days, finished a pleasure-boat with all its\n",
      "tackling, able conveniently to hold eight Europeans.  When it was\n",
      "finished, the queen was so delighted, that she ran with it in her lap to\n",
      "the king, who ordered it to be put into a cistern full of water, with me\n",
      "in it, by way of trial, where I could not manage my two sculls, or little\n",
      "oars, for want of room.  But the queen had before contrived another\n",
      "project.  She ordered the joiner to make a wooden trough of three hundred\n",
      "feet long, fifty broad, and eight deep; which, being well pitched, to\n",
      "prevent leaking, was placed on the floor, along the wall, in an outer\n",
      "room of the palace.  It had a cock near the bottom to let out the water,\n",
      "when it began to grow stale; and two servants could easily fill it in\n",
      "half an hour.  Here I often used to row for my own diversion, as well as\n",
      "that of the queen and her ladies, who thought themselves well entertained\n",
      "with my skill and agility.  Sometimes I would put up my sail, and then my\n",
      "business was only to steer, while the ladies gave me a gale with their\n",
      "fans; and, when they were weary, some of their pages would blow my sail\n",
      "forward with their breath, while I showed my art by steering starboard or\n",
      "larboard as I pleased.  When I had done, Glumdalclitch always carried\n",
      "back my boat into her closet, and hung it on a nail to dry.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this exercise I once met an accident, which had like to have cost me\n",
      "my life; for, one of the pages having put my boat into the trough, the\n",
      "governess who attended Glumdalclitch very officiously lifted me up, to\n",
      "place me in the boat: but I happened to slip through her fingers, and\n",
      "should infallibly have fallen down forty feet upon the floor, if, by the\n",
      "luckiest chance in the world, I had not been stopped by a corking-pin\n",
      "that stuck in the good gentlewoman’s stomacher; the head of the pin\n",
      "passing between my shirt and the waistband of my breeches, and thus I was\n",
      "held by the middle in the air, till Glumdalclitch ran to my relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another time, one of the servants, whose office it was to fill my trough\n",
      "every third day with fresh water, was so careless as to let a huge frog\n",
      "(not perceiving it) slip out of his pail.  The frog lay concealed till I\n",
      "was put into my boat, but then, seeing a resting-place, climbed up, and\n",
      "made it lean so much on one side, that I was forced to balance it with\n",
      "all my weight on the other, to prevent overturning.  When the frog was\n",
      "got in, it hopped at once half the length of the boat, and then over my\n",
      "head, backward and forward, daubing my face and clothes with its odious\n",
      "slime.  The largeness of its features made it appear the most deformed\n",
      "animal that can be conceived.  However, I desired Glumdalclitch to let me\n",
      "deal with it alone.  I banged it a good while with one of my sculls, and\n",
      "at last forced it to leap out of the boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the greatest danger I ever underwent in that kingdom, was from a\n",
      "monkey, who belonged to one of the clerks of the kitchen.  Glumdalclitch\n",
      "had locked me up in her closet, while she went somewhere upon business,\n",
      "or a visit.  The weather being very warm, the closet-window was left\n",
      "open, as well as the windows and the door of my bigger box, in which I\n",
      "usually lived, because of its largeness and conveniency.  As I sat\n",
      "quietly meditating at my table, I heard something bounce in at the\n",
      "closet-window, and skip about from one side to the other: whereat,\n",
      "although I was much alarmed, yet I ventured to look out, but not stirring\n",
      "from my seat; and then I saw this frolicsome animal frisking and leaping\n",
      "up and down, till at last he came to my box, which he seemed to view with\n",
      "great pleasure and curiosity, peeping in at the door and every window.  I\n",
      "retreated to the farther corner of my room; or box; but the monkey\n",
      "looking in at every side, put me in such a fright, that I wanted presence\n",
      "of mind to conceal myself under the bed, as I might easily have done.\n",
      "After some time spent in peeping, grinning, and chattering, he at last\n",
      "espied me; and reaching one of his paws in at the door, as a cat does\n",
      "when she plays with a mouse, although I often shifted place to avoid him,\n",
      "he at length seized the lappet of my coat (which being made of that\n",
      "country silk, was very thick and strong), and dragged me out.  He took me\n",
      "up in his right fore-foot and held me as a nurse does a child she is\n",
      "going to suckle, just as I have seen the same sort of creature do with a\n",
      "kitten in Europe; and when I offered to struggle he squeezed me so hard,\n",
      "that I thought it more prudent to submit.  I have good reason to believe,\n",
      "that he took me for a young one of his own species, by his often stroking\n",
      "my face very gently with his other paw.  In these diversions he was\n",
      "interrupted by a noise at the closet door, as if somebody were opening\n",
      "it: whereupon he suddenly leaped up to the window at which he had come\n",
      "in, and thence upon the leads and gutters, walking upon three legs, and\n",
      "holding me in the fourth, till he clambered up to a roof that was next to\n",
      "ours.  I heard Glumdalclitch give a shriek at the moment he was carrying\n",
      "me out.  The poor girl was almost distracted: that quarter of the palace\n",
      "was all in an uproar; the servants ran for ladders; the monkey was seen\n",
      "by hundreds in the court, sitting upon the ridge of a building, holding\n",
      "me like a baby in one of his forepaws, and feeding me with the other, by\n",
      "cramming into my mouth some victuals he had squeezed out of the bag on\n",
      "one side of his chaps, and patting me when I would not eat; whereat many\n",
      "of the rabble below could not forbear laughing; neither do I think they\n",
      "justly ought to be blamed, for, without question, the sight was\n",
      "ridiculous enough to every body but myself.  Some of the people threw up\n",
      "stones, hoping to drive the monkey down; but this was strictly forbidden,\n",
      "or else, very probably, my brains had been dashed out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ladders were now applied, and mounted by several men; which the\n",
      "monkey observing, and finding himself almost encompassed, not being able\n",
      "to make speed enough with his three legs, let me drop on a ridge tile,\n",
      "and made his escape.  Here I sat for some time, five hundred yards from\n",
      "the ground, expecting every moment to be blown down by the wind, or to\n",
      "fall by my own giddiness, and come tumbling over and over from the ridge\n",
      "to the eaves; but an honest lad, one of my nurse’s footmen, climbed up,\n",
      "and putting me into his breeches pocket, brought me down safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was almost choked with the filthy stuff the monkey had crammed down my\n",
      "throat: but my dear little nurse picked it out of my mouth with a small\n",
      "needle, and then I fell a-vomiting, which gave me great relief.  Yet I\n",
      "was so weak and bruised in the sides with the squeezes given me by this\n",
      "odious animal, that I was forced to keep my bed a fortnight.  The king,\n",
      "queen, and all the court, sent every day to inquire after my health; and\n",
      "her majesty made me several visits during my sickness.  The monkey was\n",
      "killed, and an order made, that no such animal should be kept about the\n",
      "palace.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I attended the king after my recovery, to return him thanks for his\n",
      "favours, he was pleased to rally me a good deal upon this adventure.  He\n",
      "asked me, “what my thoughts and speculations were, while I lay in the\n",
      "monkey’s paw; how I liked the victuals he gave me; his manner of feeding;\n",
      "and whether the fresh air on the roof had sharpened my stomach.”  He\n",
      "desired to know, “what I would have done upon such an occasion in my own\n",
      "country.”  I told his majesty, “that in Europe we had no monkeys, except\n",
      "such as were brought for curiosity from other places, and so small, that\n",
      "I could deal with a dozen of them together, if they presumed to attack\n",
      "me.  And as for that monstrous animal with whom I was so lately engaged\n",
      "(it was indeed as large as an elephant), if my fears had suffered me to\n",
      "think so far as to make use of my hanger,” (looking fiercely, and\n",
      "clapping my hand on the hilt, as I spoke) “when he poked his paw into my\n",
      "chamber, perhaps I should have given him such a wound, as would have made\n",
      "him glad to withdraw it with more haste than he put it in.”  This I\n",
      "delivered in a firm tone, like a person who was jealous lest his courage\n",
      "should be called in question.  However, my speech produced nothing else\n",
      "beside a laud laughter, which all the respect due to his majesty from\n",
      "those about him could not make them contain.  This made me reflect, how\n",
      "vain an attempt it is for a man to endeavour to do himself honour among\n",
      "those who are out of all degree of equality or comparison with him.  And\n",
      "yet I have seen the moral of my own behaviour very frequent in England\n",
      "since my return; where a little contemptible varlet, without the least\n",
      "title to birth, person, wit, or common sense, shall presume to look with\n",
      "importance, and put himself upon a foot with the greatest persons of the\n",
      "kingdom.\n",

      "I was every day furnishing the court with some ridiculous story: and\n",
      "Glumdalclitch, although she loved me to excess, yet was arch enough to\n",
      "inform the queen, whenever I committed any folly that she thought would\n",
      "be diverting to her majesty.  The girl, who had been out of order, was\n",
      "carried by her governess to take the air about an hour’s distance, or\n",
      "thirty miles from town.  They alighted out of the coach near a small\n",
      "foot-path in a field, and Glumdalclitch setting down my travelling box, I\n",
      "went out of it to walk.  There was a cow-dung in the path, and I must\n",
      "need try my activity by attempting to leap over it.  I took a run, but\n",
      "unfortunately jumped short, and found myself just in the middle up to my\n",
      "knees.  I waded through with some difficulty, and one of the footmen\n",
      "wiped me as clean as he could with his handkerchief, for I was filthily\n",
      "bemired; and my nurse confined me to my box, till we returned home; where\n",
      "the queen was soon informed of what had passed, and the footmen spread it\n",

      "CHAPTER VI.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Several contrivances of the author to please the king and queen.  He\n",
      "shows his skill in music.  The king inquires into the state of England,\n",
      "which the author relates to him.  The king’s observations thereon.\n",
      "\n",
      "I used to attend the king’s levee once or twice a week, and had often\n",
      "seen him under the barber’s hand, which indeed was at first very terrible\n",
      "to behold; for the razor was almost twice as long as an ordinary scythe.\n",
      "His majesty, according to the custom of the country, was only shaved\n",
      "twice a-week.  I once prevailed on the barber to give me some of the suds\n",
      "or lather, out of which I picked forty or fifty of the strongest stumps\n",
      "of hair.  I then took a piece of fine wood, and cut it like the back of a\n",
      "comb, making several holes in it at equal distances with as small a\n",
      "needle as I could get from Glumdalclitch.  I fixed in the stumps so\n",
      "artificially, scraping and sloping them with my knife toward the points,\n",
      "that I made a very tolerable comb; which was a seasonable supply, my own\n",
      "being so much broken in the teeth, that it was almost useless: neither\n",
      "did I know any artist in that country so nice and exact, as would\n",
      "undertake to make me another.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this puts me in mind of an amusement, wherein I spent many of my\n",
      "leisure hours.  I desired the queen’s woman to save for me the combings\n",
      "of her majesty’s hair, whereof in time I got a good quantity; and\n",
      "consulting with my friend the cabinet-maker, who had received general\n",
      "orders to do little jobs for me, I directed him to make two chair-frames,\n",
      "no larger than those I had in my box, and to bore little holes with a\n",
      "fine awl, round those parts where I designed the backs and seats; through\n",
      "these holes I wove the strongest hairs I could pick out, just after the\n",
      "manner of cane chairs in England.  When they were finished, I made a\n",
      "present of them to her majesty; who kept them in her cabinet, and used to\n",
      "show them for curiosities, as indeed they were the wonder of every one\n",
      "that beheld them.  The queen would have me sit upon one of these chairs,\n",
      "but I absolutely refused to obey her, protesting I would rather die than\n",
      "place a dishonourable part of my body on those precious hairs, that once\n",
      "adorned her majesty’s head.  Of these hairs (as I had always a mechanical\n",
      "genius) I likewise made a neat little purse, about five feet long, with\n",
      "her majesty’s name deciphered in gold letters, which I gave to\n",
      "Glumdalclitch, by the queen’s consent.  To say the truth, it was more for\n",
      "show than use, being not of strength to bear the weight of the larger\n",
      "coins, and therefore she kept nothing in it but some little toys that\n",
      "girls are fond of.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king, who delighted in music, had frequent concerts at court, to\n",
      "which I was sometimes carried, and set in my box on a table to hear them:\n",
      "but the noise was so great that I could hardly distinguish the tunes.  I\n",
      "am confident that all the drums and trumpets of a royal army, beating and\n",
      "sounding together just at your ears, could not equal it.  My practice was\n",
      "to have my box removed from the place where the performers sat, as far as\n",
      "I could, then to shut the doors and windows of it, and draw the window\n",
      "curtains; after which I found their music not disagreeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had learned in my youth to play a little upon the spinet.\n",
      "Glumdalclitch kept one in her chamber, and a master attended twice a-week\n",
      "to teach her: I called it a spinet, because it somewhat resembled that\n",
      "instrument, and was played upon in the same manner.  A fancy came into my\n",
      "head, that I would entertain the king and queen with an English tune upon\n",
      "this instrument.  But this appeared extremely difficult: for the spinet\n",
      "was near sixty feet long, each key being almost a foot wide, so that with\n",
      "my arms extended I could not reach to above five keys, and to press them\n",
      "down required a good smart stroke with my fist, which would be too great\n",
      "a labour, and to no purpose.  The method I contrived was this: I prepared\n",
      "two round sticks, about the bigness of common cudgels; they were thicker\n",
      "at one end than the other, and I covered the thicker ends with pieces of\n",
      "a mouse’s skin, that by rapping on them I might neither damage the tops\n",
      "of the keys nor interrupt the sound.  Before the spinet a bench was\n",
      "placed, about four feet below the keys, and I was put upon the bench.  I\n",
      "ran sideling upon it, that way and this, as fast as I could, banging the\n",
      "proper keys with my two sticks, and made a shift to play a jig, to the\n",
      "great satisfaction of both their majesties; but it was the most violent\n",
      "exercise I ever underwent; and yet I could not strike above sixteen keys,\n",
      "nor consequently play the bass and treble together, as other artists do;\n",
      "which was a great disadvantage to my performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king, who, as I before observed, was a prince of excellent\n",
      "understanding, would frequently order that I should be brought in my box,\n",
      "and set upon the table in his closet: he would then command me to bring\n",
      "one of my chairs out of the box, and sit down within three yards distance\n",
      "upon the top of the cabinet, which brought me almost to a level with his\n",
      "face.  In this manner I had several conversations with him.  I one day\n",
      "took the freedom to tell his majesty, “that the contempt he discovered\n",
      "towards Europe, and the rest of the world, did not seem answerable to\n",
      "those excellent qualities of mind that he was master of; that reason did\n",
      "not extend itself with the bulk of the body; on the contrary, we observed\n",
      "in our country, that the tallest persons were usually the least provided\n",
      "with it; that among other animals, bees and ants had the reputation of\n",
      "more industry, art, and sagacity, than many of the larger kinds; and\n",
      "that, as inconsiderable as he took me to be, I hoped I might live to do\n",
      "his majesty some signal service.”  The king heard me with attention, and\n",
      "began to conceive a much better opinion of me than he had ever before.\n",
      "He desired “I would give him as exact an account of the government of\n",
      "England as I possibly could; because, as fond as princes commonly are of\n",
      "their own customs (for so he conjectured of other monarchs, by my former\n",
      "discourses), he should be glad to hear of any thing that might deserve\n",
      "imitation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine with thyself, courteous reader, how often I then wished for the\n",
      "tongue of Demosthenes or Cicero, that might have enabled me to celebrate\n",
      "the praise of my own dear native country in a style equal to its merits\n",
      "and felicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "I began my discourse by informing his majesty, that our dominions\n",
      "consisted of two islands, which composed three mighty kingdoms, under one\n",
      "sovereign, beside our plantations in America.  I dwelt long upon the\n",
      "fertility of our soil, and the temperature of our climate.  I then spoke\n",
      "at large upon the constitution of an English parliament; partly made up\n",
      "of an illustrious body called the House of Peers; persons of the noblest\n",
      "blood, and of the most ancient and ample patrimonies.  I described that\n",
      "extraordinary care always taken of their education in arts and arms, to\n",
      "qualify them for being counsellors both to the king and kingdom; to have\n",
      "a share in the legislature; to be members of the highest court of\n",
      "judicature, whence there can be no appeal; and to be champions always\n",
      "ready for the defence of their prince and country, by their valour,\n",
      "conduct, and fidelity.  That these were the ornament and bulwark of the\n",
      "kingdom, worthy followers of their most renowned ancestors, whose honour\n",
      "had been the reward of their virtue, from which their posterity were\n",
      "never once known to degenerate.  To these were joined several holy\n",
      "persons, as part of that assembly, under the title of bishops, whose\n",
      "peculiar business is to take care of religion, and of those who instruct\n",
      "the people therein.  These were searched and sought out through the whole\n",
      "nation, by the prince and his wisest counsellors, among such of the\n",
      "priesthood as were most deservedly distinguished by the sanctity of their\n",
      "lives, and the depth of their erudition; who were indeed the spiritual\n",
      "fathers of the clergy and the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "That the other part of the parliament consisted of an assembly called the\n",
      "House of Commons, who were all principal gentlemen, freely picked and\n",
      "culled out by the people themselves, for their great abilities and love\n",
      "of their country, to represent the wisdom of the whole nation.  And that\n",
      "these two bodies made up the most august assembly in Europe; to whom, in\n",
      "conjunction with the prince, the whole legislature is committed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then descended to the courts of justice; over which the judges, those\n",
      "venerable sages and interpreters of the law, presided, for determining\n",
      "the disputed rights and properties of men, as well as for the punishment\n",
      "of vice and protection of innocence.  I mentioned the prudent management\n",
      "of our treasury; the valour and achievements of our forces, by sea and\n",
      "land.  I computed the number of our people, by reckoning how many\n",
      "millions there might be of each religious sect, or political party among\n",
      "us.  I did not omit even our sports and pastimes, or any other particular\n",
      "which I thought might redound to the honour of my country.  And I\n",
      "finished all with a brief historical account of affairs and events in\n",
      "England for about a hundred years past.\n",
      "\n",
      "This conversation was not ended under five audiences, each of several\n",
      "hours; and the king heard the whole with great attention, frequently\n",

      "justice, recommends to an historian: I would hide the frailties and\n",

      "moment, although it were as big as a mountain, and make it all fly up in\n",
      "the air together, with a noise and agitation greater than thunder.  That\n",
      "a proper quantity of this powder rammed into a hollow tube of brass or\n",
      "iron, according to its bigness, would drive a ball of iron or lead, with\n",
      "such violence and speed, as nothing was able to sustain its force.  That\n",
      "the largest balls thus discharged, would not only destroy whole ranks of\n",
      "an army at once, but batter the strongest walls to the ground, sink down\n",
      "ships, with a thousand men in each, to the bottom of the sea, and when\n",
      "linked together by a chain, would cut through masts and rigging, divide\n",
      "hundreds of bodies in the middle, and lay all waste before them.  That we\n",
      "often put this powder into large hollow balls of iron, and discharged\n",
      "them by an engine into some city we were besieging, which would rip up\n",

      "old treatise, which always lay in Glumdalclitch’s bed chamber, and\n",
      "belonged to her governess, a grave elderly gentlewoman, who dealt in\n",
      "writings of morality and devotion.  The book treats of the weakness of\n",
      "human kind, and is in little esteem, except among the women and the\n",
      "vulgar.  However, I was curious to see what an author of that country\n",
      "could say upon such a subject.  This writer went through all the usual\n",
      "topics of European moralists, showing “how diminutive, contemptible, and\n",
      "helpless an animal was man in his own nature; how unable to defend\n",
      "himself from inclemencies of the air, or the fury of wild beasts: how\n",
      "much he was excelled by one creature in strength, by another in speed, by\n",
      "a third in foresight, by a fourth in industry.”  He added, “that nature\n",
      "was degenerated in these latter declining ages of the world, and could\n",
      "now produce only small abortive births, in comparison of those in ancient\n",
      "times.”  He said “it was very reasonable to think, not only that the\n",
      "species of men were originally much larger, but also that there must have\n",
      "been giants in former ages; which, as it is asserted by history and\n",
      "tradition, so it has been confirmed by huge bones and skulls, casually\n",
      "dug up in several parts of the kingdom, far exceeding the common dwindled\n",
      "race of men in our days.”  He argued, “that the very laws of nature\n",
      "absolutely required we should have been made, in the beginning of a size\n",
      "more large and robust; not so liable to destruction from every little\n",
      "accident, of a tile falling from a house, or a stone cast from the hand\n",
      "of a boy, or being drowned in a little brook.”  From this way of\n",
      "reasoning, the author drew several moral applications, useful in the\n",
      "conduct of life, but needless here to repeat.  For my own part, I could\n",
      "not avoid reflecting how universally this talent was spread, of drawing\n",
      "lectures in morality, or indeed rather matter of discontent and repining,\n",
      "from the quarrels we raise with nature.  And I believe, upon a strict\n",

      "I had always a strong impulse that I should some time recover my liberty,\n",
      "though it was impossible to conjecture by what means, or to form any\n",
      "project with the least hope of succeeding.  The ship in which I sailed,\n",
      "was the first ever known to be driven within sight of that coast, and the\n",
      "king had given strict orders, that if at any time another appeared, it\n",
      "should be taken ashore, and with all its crew and passengers brought in a\n",

      "in cages, like tame canary-birds, and perhaps, in time, sold about the\n",

      "with much kindness: I was the favourite of a great king and queen, and\n",
      "the delight of the whole court; but it was upon such a foot as ill became\n",
      "the dignity of humankind.  I could never forget those domestic pledges I\n",
      "had left behind me.  I wanted to be among people, with whom I could\n",
      "converse upon even terms, and walk about the streets and fields without\n",
      "being afraid of being trod to death like a frog or a young puppy.  But my\n",
      "deliverance came sooner than I expected, and in a manner not very common;\n",
      "the whole story and circumstances of which I shall faithfully relate.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had now been two years in this country; and about the beginning of the\n",
      "third, Glumdalclitch and I attended the king and queen, in a progress to\n",
      "the south coast of the kingdom.  I was carried, as usual, in my\n",
      "travelling-box, which as I have already described, was a very convenient\n",
      "closet, of twelve feet wide.  And I had ordered a hammock to be fixed, by\n",
      "silken ropes from the four corners at the top, to break the jolts, when a\n",
      "servant carried me before him on horseback, as I sometimes desired; and\n",
      "would often sleep in my hammock, while we were upon the road.  On the\n",
      "roof of my closet, not directly over the middle of the hammock, I ordered\n",
      "the joiner to cut out a hole of a foot square, to give me air in hot\n",
      "weather, as I slept; which hole I shut at pleasure with a board that drew\n",
      "backward and forward through a groove.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we came to our journey’s end, the king thought proper to pass a few\n",
      "days at a palace he has near Flanflasnic, a city within eighteen English\n",
      "miles of the seaside.  Glumdalclitch and I were much fatigued: I had\n",
      "gotten a small cold, but the poor girl was so ill as to be confined to\n",
      "her chamber.  I longed to see the ocean, which must be the only scene of\n",
      "my escape, if ever it should happen.  I pretended to be worse than I\n",
      "really was, and desired leave to take the fresh air of the sea, with a\n",
      "page, whom I was very fond of, and who had sometimes been trusted with\n",
      "me.  I shall never forget with what unwillingness Glumdalclitch\n",
      "consented, nor the strict charge she gave the page to be careful of me,\n",
      "bursting at the same time into a flood of tears, as if she had some\n",
      "forboding of what was to happen.  The boy took me out in my box, about\n",
      "half an hours walk from the palace, towards the rocks on the sea-shore.\n",
      "I ordered him to set me down, and lifting up one of my sashes, cast many\n",
      "a wistful melancholy look towards the sea.  I found myself not very well,\n",
      "and told the page that I had a mind to take a nap in my hammock, which I\n",
      "hoped would do me good.  I got in, and the boy shut the window close\n",
      "down, to keep out the cold.  I soon fell asleep, and all I can conjecture\n",
      "is, while I slept, the page, thinking no danger could happen, went among\n",
      "the rocks to look for birds’ eggs, having before observed him from my\n",
      "window searching about, and picking up one or two in the clefts.  Be that\n",
      "as it will, I found myself suddenly awaked with a violent pull upon the\n",
      "ring, which was fastened at the top of my box for the conveniency of\n",
      "carriage.  I felt my box raised very high in the air, and then borne\n",
      "forward with prodigious speed.  The first jolt had like to have shaken me\n",
      "out of my hammock, but afterward the motion was easy enough.  I called\n",
      "out several times, as loud as I could raise my voice, but all to no\n",
      "purpose.  I looked towards my windows, and could see nothing but the\n",
      "clouds and sky.  I heard a noise just over my head, like the clapping of\n",
      "wings, and then began to perceive the woful condition I was in; that some\n",
      "eagle had got the ring of my box in his beak, with an intent to let it\n",
      "fall on a rock, like a tortoise in a shell, and then pick out my body,\n",
      "and devour it: for the sagacity and smell of this bird enables him to\n",
      "discover his quarry at a great distance, though better concealed than I\n",
      "could be within a two-inch board.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a little time, I observed the noise and flutter of wings to increase\n",
      "very fast, and my box was tossed up and down, like a sign in a windy day.\n",
      "I heard several bangs or buffets, as I thought given to the eagle (for\n",
      "such I am certain it must have been that held the ring of my box in his\n",
      "beak), and then, all on a sudden, felt myself falling perpendicularly\n",
      "down, for above a minute, but with such incredible swiftness, that I\n",
      "almost lost my breath.  My fall was stopped by a terrible squash, that\n",
      "sounded louder to my ears than the cataract of Niagara; after which, I\n",
      "was quite in the dark for another minute, and then my box began to rise\n",
      "so high, that I could see light from the tops of the windows.  I now\n",
      "perceived I was fallen into the sea.  My box, by the weight of my body,\n",
      "the goods that were in, and the broad plates of iron fixed for strength\n",
      "at the four corners of the top and bottom, floated about five feet deep\n",
      "in water.  I did then, and do now suppose, that the eagle which flew away\n",
      "with my box was pursued by two or three others, and forced to let me\n",
      "drop, while he defended himself against the rest, who hoped to share in\n",
      "the prey.  The plates of iron fastened at the bottom of the box (for\n",
      "those were the strongest) preserved the balance while it fell, and\n",
      "hindered it from being broken on the surface of the water. Every joint of\n",
      "it was well grooved; and the door did not move on hinges, but up and down\n",
      "like a sash, which kept my closet so tight that very little water came\n",
      "in.  I got with much difficulty out of my hammock, having first ventured\n",
      "to draw back the slip-board on the roof already mentioned, contrived on\n",
      "purpose to let in air, for want of which I found myself almost stifled.\n",
      "\n",
      "How often did I then wish myself with my dear Glumdalclitch, from whom\n",
      "one single hour had so far divided me!  And I may say with truth, that in\n",
      "the midst of my own misfortunes I could not forbear lamenting my poor\n",
      "nurse, the grief she would suffer for my loss, the displeasure of the\n",
      "queen, and the ruin of her fortune.  Perhaps many travellers have not\n",
      "been under greater difficulties and distress than I was at this juncture,\n",
      "expecting every moment to see my box dashed to pieces, or at least\n",
      "overset by the first violent blast, or rising wave.  A breach in one\n",
      "single pane of glass would have been immediate death: nor could any thing\n",
      "have preserved the windows, but the strong lattice wires placed on the\n",
      "outside, against accidents in travelling.  I saw the water ooze in at\n",
      "several crannies, although the leaks were not considerable, and I\n",
      "endeavoured to stop them as well as I could.  I was not able to lift up\n",
      "the roof of my closet, which otherwise I certainly should have done, and\n",
      "sat on the top of it; where I might at least preserve myself some hours\n",
      "longer, than by being shut up (as I may call it) in the hold.  Or if I\n",
      "escaped these dangers for a day or two, what could I expect but a\n",
      "miserable death of cold and hunger?  I was four hours under these\n",
      "circumstances, expecting, and indeed wishing, every moment to be my last.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have already told the reader that there were two strong staples fixed\n",
      "upon that side of my box which had no window, and into which the servant,\n",
      "who used to carry me on horseback, would put a leathern belt, and buckle\n",
      "it about his waist.  Being in this disconsolate state, I heard, or at\n",
      "least thought I heard, some kind of grating noise on that side of my box\n",
      "where the staples were fixed; and soon after I began to fancy that the\n",
      "box was pulled or towed along the sea; for I now and then felt a sort of\n",
      "tugging, which made the waves rise near the tops of my windows, leaving\n",
      "me almost in the dark.  This gave me some faint hopes of relief, although\n",
      "I was not able to imagine how it could be brought about.  I ventured to\n",
      "unscrew one of my chairs, which were always fastened to the floor; and\n",
      "having made a hard shift to screw it down again, directly under the\n",
      "slipping-board that I had lately opened, I mounted on the chair, and\n",
      "putting my mouth as near as I could to the hole, I called for help in a\n",
      "loud voice, and in all the languages I understood.  I then fastened my\n",
      "handkerchief to a stick I usually carried, and thrusting it up the hole,\n",
      "waved it several times in the air, that if any boat or ship were near,\n",
      "the seamen might conjecture some unhappy mortal to be shut up in the box.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found no effect from all I could do, but plainly perceived my closet to\n",
      "be moved along; and in the space of an hour, or better, that side of the\n",
      "box where the staples were, and had no windows, struck against something\n",
      "that was hard.  I apprehended it to be a rock, and found myself tossed\n",
      "more than ever.  I plainly heard a noise upon the cover of my closet,\n",
      "like that of a cable, and the grating of it as it passed through the\n",
      "ring.  I then found myself hoisted up, by degrees, at least three feet\n",
      "higher than I was before.  Whereupon I again thrust up my stick and\n",
      "handkerchief, calling for help till I was almost hoarse.  In return to\n",
      "which, I heard a great shout repeated three times, giving me such\n",
      "transports of joy as are not to be conceived but by those who feel them.\n",
      "I now heard a trampling over my head, and somebody calling through the\n",
      "hole with a loud voice, in the English tongue, “If there be any body\n",
      "below, let them speak.”  I answered, “I was an Englishman, drawn by ill\n",
      "fortune into the greatest calamity that ever any creature underwent, and\n",
      "begged, by all that was moving, to be delivered out of the dungeon I was\n",
      "in.”  The voice replied, “I was safe, for my box was fastened to their\n",
      "ship; and the carpenter should immediately come and saw a hole in the\n",
      "cover, large enough to pull me out.”  I answered, “that was needless, and\n",
      "would take up too much time; for there was no more to be done, but let\n",
      "one of the crew put his finger into the ring, and take the box out of the\n",
      "sea into the ship, and so into the captain’s cabin.”  Some of them, upon\n",
      "hearing me talk so wildly, thought I was mad: others laughed; for indeed\n",
      "it never came into my head, that I was now got among people of my own\n",
      "stature and strength.  The carpenter came, and in a few minutes sawed a\n",
      "passage about four feet square, then let down a small ladder, upon which\n",
      "I mounted, and thence was taken into the ship in a very weak condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sailors were all in amazement, and asked me a thousand questions,\n",
      "which I had no inclination to answer.  I was equally confounded at the\n",
      "sight of so many pigmies, for such I took them to be, after having so\n",
      "long accustomed mine eyes to the monstrous objects I had left.  But the\n",
      "captain, Mr. Thomas Wilcocks, an honest worthy Shropshire man, observing\n",
      "I was ready to faint, took me into his cabin, gave me a cordial to\n",
      "comfort me, and made me turn in upon his own bed, advising me to take a\n",
      "little rest, of which I had great need.  Before I went to sleep, I gave\n",
      "him to understand that I had some valuable furniture in my box, too good\n",
      "to be lost: a fine hammock, a handsome field-bed, two chairs, a table,\n",
      "and a cabinet; that my closet was hung on all sides, or rather quilted,\n",
      "with silk and cotton; that if he would let one of the crew bring my\n",
      "closet into his cabin, I would open it there before him, and show him my\n",
      "goods.  The captain, hearing me utter these absurdities, concluded I was\n",
      "raving; however (I suppose to pacify me) he promised to give order as I\n",
      "desired, and going upon deck, sent some of his men down into my closet,\n",
      "whence (as I afterwards found) they drew up all my goods, and stripped\n",
      "off the quilting; but the chairs, cabinet, and bedstead, being screwed to\n",
      "the floor, were much damaged by the ignorance of the seamen, who tore\n",
      "them up by force.  Then they knocked off some of the boards for the use\n",
      "of the ship, and when they had got all they had a mind for, let the hull\n",
      "drop into the sea, which by reason of many breaches made in the bottom\n",
      "and sides, sunk to rights.  And, indeed, I was glad not to have been a\n",
      "spectator of the havoc they made, because I am confident it would have\n",
      "sensibly touched me, by bringing former passages into my mind, which I\n",
      "would rather have forgot.\n",
      "\n",
      "I slept some hours, but perpetually disturbed with dreams of the place I\n",
      "had left, and the dangers I had escaped.  However, upon waking, I found\n",
      "myself much recovered.  It was now about eight o’clock at night, and the\n",
      "captain ordered supper immediately, thinking I had already fasted too\n",
      "long.  He entertained me with great kindness, observing me not to look\n",
      "wildly, or talk inconsistently: and, when we were left alone, desired I\n",
      "would give him a relation of my travels, and by what accident I came to\n",
      "be set adrift, in that monstrous wooden chest.  He said “that about\n",
      "twelve o’clock at noon, as he was looking through his glass, he spied it\n",
      "at a distance, and thought it was a sail, which he had a mind to make,\n",
      "being not much out of his course, in hopes of buying some biscuit, his\n",
      "own beginning to fall short.  That upon coming nearer, and finding his\n",
      "error, he sent out his long-boat to discover what it was; that his men\n",
      "came back in a fright, swearing they had seen a swimming house.  That he\n",
      "laughed at their folly, and went himself in the boat, ordering his men to\n",
      "take a strong cable along with them.  That the weather being calm, he\n",
      "rowed round me several times, observed my windows and wire lattices that\n",
      "defended them.  That he discovered two staples upon one side, which was\n",
      "all of boards, without any passage for light.  He then commanded his men\n",
      "to row up to that side, and fastening a cable to one of the staples,\n",
      "ordered them to tow my chest, as they called it, toward the ship.  When\n",
      "it was there, he gave directions to fasten another cable to the ring\n",
      "fixed in the cover, and to raise up my chest with pulleys, which all the\n",
      "sailors were not able to do above two or three feet.”  He said, “they saw\n",
      "my stick and handkerchief thrust out of the hole, and concluded that some\n",
      "unhappy man must be shut up in the cavity.”  I asked, “whether he or the\n",
      "crew had seen any prodigious birds in the air, about the time he first\n",
      "discovered me.”  To which he answered, “that discoursing this matter with\n",
      "the sailors while I was asleep, one of them said, he had observed three\n",
      "eagles flying towards the north, but remarked nothing of their being\n",
      "larger than the usual size:” which I suppose must be imputed to the great\n",
      "height they were at; and he could not guess the reason of my question.  I\n",
      "then asked the captain, “how far he reckoned we might be from land?”  He\n",
      "said, “by the best computation he could make, we were at least a hundred\n",
      "leagues.”  I assured him, “that he must be mistaken by almost half, for I\n",
      "had not left the country whence I came above two hours before I dropped\n",
      "into the sea.”  Whereupon he began again to think that my brain was\n",
      "disturbed, of which he gave me a hint, and advised me to go to bed in a\n",
      "cabin he had provided.  I assured him, “I was well refreshed with his\n",
      "good entertainment and company, and as much in my senses as ever I was in\n",
      "my life.”  He then grew serious, and desired to ask me freely, “whether I\n",
      "were not troubled in my mind by the consciousness of some enormous crime,\n",
      "for which I was punished, at the command of some prince, by exposing me\n",
      "in that chest; as great criminals, in other countries, have been forced\n",
      "to sea in a leaky vessel, without provisions: for although he should be\n",
      "sorry to have taken so ill a man into his ship, yet he would engage his\n",
      "word to set me safe ashore, in the first port where we arrived.”  He\n",
      "added, “that his suspicions were much increased by some very absurd\n",
      "speeches I had delivered at first to his sailors, and afterwards to\n",
      "himself, in relation to my closet or chest, as well as by my odd looks\n",
      "and behaviour while I was at supper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I begged his patience to hear me tell my story, which I faithfully did,\n",
      "from the last time I left England, to the moment he first discovered me.\n",
      "And, as truth always forces its way into rational minds, so this honest\n",
      "worthy gentleman, who had some tincture of learning, and very good sense,\n",
      "was immediately convinced of my candour and veracity.  But further to\n",
      "confirm all I had said, I entreated him to give order that my cabinet\n",
      "should be brought, of which I had the key in my pocket; for he had\n",
      "already informed me how the seamen disposed of my closet.  I opened it in\n",
      "his own presence, and showed him the small collection of rarities I made\n",
      "in the country from which I had been so strangely delivered.  There was\n",
      "the comb I had contrived out of the stumps of the king’s beard, and\n",
      "another of the same materials, but fixed into a paring of her majesty’s\n",
      "thumb-nail, which served for the back.  There was a collection of needles\n",
      "and pins, from a foot to half a yard long; four wasp stings, like\n",
      "joiner’s tacks; some combings of the queen’s hair; a gold ring, which one\n",
      "day she made me a present of, in a most obliging manner, taking it from\n",
      "her little finger, and throwing it over my head like a collar.  I desired\n",
      "the captain would please to accept this ring in return for his\n",
      "civilities; which he absolutely refused.  I showed him a corn that I had\n",
      "cut off with my own hand, from a maid of honour’s toe; it was about the\n",
      "bigness of Kentish pippin, and grown so hard, that when I returned\n",
      "England, I got it hollowed into a cup, and set in silver.  Lastly, I\n",
      "desired him to see the breeches I had then on, which were made of a\n",
      "mouse’s skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could force nothing on him but a footman’s tooth, which I observed him\n",
      "to examine with great curiosity, and found he had a fancy for it.  He\n",
      "received it with abundance of thanks, more than such a trifle could\n",
      "deserve.  It was drawn by an unskilful surgeon, in a mistake, from one of\n",
      "Glumdalclitch’s men, who was afflicted with the tooth-ache, but it was as\n",
      "sound as any in his head.  I got it cleaned, and put it into my cabinet.\n",
      "It was about a foot long, and four inches in diameter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The captain was very well satisfied with this plain relation I had given\n",
      "him, and said, “he hoped, when we returned to England, I would oblige the\n",
      "world by putting it on paper, and making it public.”  My answer was,\n",
      "“that we were overstocked with books of travels: that nothing could now\n",
      "pass which was not extraordinary; wherein I doubted some authors less\n",
      "consulted truth, than their own vanity, or interest, or the diversion of\n",
      "ignorant readers; that my story could contain little beside common\n",
      "events, without those ornamental descriptions of strange plants, trees,\n",
      "birds, and other animals; or of the barbarous customs and idolatry of\n",
      "savage people, with which most writers abound.  However, I thanked him\n",
      "for his good opinion, and promised to take the matter into my thoughts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He said “he wondered at one thing very much, which was, to hear me speak\n",
      "so loud;” asking me “whether the king or queen of that country were thick\n",
      "of hearing?”  I told him, “it was what I had been used to for above two\n",
      "years past, and that I admired as much at the voices of him and his men,\n",
      "who seemed to me only to whisper, and yet I could hear them well enough.\n",
      "But, when I spoke in that country, it was like a man talking in the\n",
      "streets, to another looking out from the top of a steeple, unless when I\n",
      "was placed on a table, or held in any person’s hand.”  I told him, “I had\n",
      "likewise observed another thing, that, when I first got into the ship,\n",
      "and the sailors stood all about me, I thought they were the most little\n",
      "contemptible creatures I had ever beheld.”  For indeed, while I was in\n",
      "that prince’s country, I could never endure to look in a glass, after\n",
      "mine eyes had been accustomed to such prodigious objects, because the\n",
      "comparison gave me so despicable a conceit of myself.  The captain said,\n",
      "“that while we were at supper, he observed me to look at every thing with\n",
      "a sort of wonder, and that I often seemed hardly able to contain my\n",
      "laughter, which he knew not well how to take, but imputed it to some\n",
      "disorder in my brain.”  I answered, “it was very true; and I wondered how\n",
      "I could forbear, when I saw his dishes of the size of a silver\n",
      "three-pence, a leg of pork hardly a mouthful, a cup not so big as a\n",
      "nut-shell;” and so I went on, describing the rest of his household-stuff\n",
      "and provisions, after the same manner.  For, although he queen had\n",
      "ordered a little equipage of all things necessary for me, while I was in\n",
      "her service, yet my ideas were wholly taken up with what I saw on every\n",
      "side of me, and I winked at my own littleness, as people do at their own\n",
      "faults.  The captain understood my raillery very well, and merrily\n",
      "replied with the old English proverb, “that he doubted mine eyes were\n",
      "bigger than my belly, for he did not observe my stomach so good, although\n",
      "I had fasted all day;” and, continuing in his mirth, protested “he would\n",
      "have gladly given a hundred pounds, to have seen my closet in the eagle’s\n",
      "bill, and afterwards in its fall from so great a height into the sea;\n",
      "which would certainly have been a most astonishing object, worthy to have\n",
      "the description of it transmitted to future ages:” and the comparison of\n",
      "Phaëton was so obvious, that he could not forbear applying it, although I\n",
      "did not much admire the conceit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The captain having been at Tonquin, was, in his return to England, driven\n",
      "north-eastward to the latitude of 44 degrees, and longitude of 143.  But\n",
      "meeting a trade-wind two days after I came on board him, we sailed\n",
      "southward a long time, and coasting New Holland, kept our course\n",
      "west-south-west, and then south-south-west, till we doubled the Cape of\n",
      "Good Hope.  Our voyage was very prosperous, but I shall not trouble the\n",
      "reader with a journal of it.  The captain called in at one or two ports,\n",
      "and sent in his long-boat for provisions and fresh water; but I never\n",
      "went out of the ship till we came into the Downs, which was on the third\n",
      "day of June, 1706, about nine months after my escape.  I offered to leave\n",
      "my goods in security for payment of my freight: but the captain protested\n",
      "he would not receive one farthing.  We took a kind leave of each other,\n",
      "and I made him promise he would come to see me at my house in Redriff.  I\n",
      "hired a horse and guide for five shillings, which I borrowed of the\n",
      "captain.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I was on the road, observing the littleness of the houses, the trees,\n",
      "the cattle, and the people, I began to think myself in Lilliput.  I was\n",
      "afraid of trampling on every traveller I met, and often called aloud to\n",

      "so unaccountably, that they were all of the captain’s opinion when he\n",

      "We set out the 5th day of August, 1706, and arrived at Fort St. George\n",
      "the 11th of April, 1707.  We staid there three weeks to refresh our crew,\n",
      "many of whom were sick.  From thence we went to Tonquin, where the\n",
      "captain resolved to continue some time, because many of the goods he\n",
      "intended to buy were not ready, nor could he expect to be dispatched in\n",
      "several months.  Therefore, in hopes to defray some of the charges he\n",
      "must be at, he bought a sloop, loaded it with several sorts of goods,\n",
      "wherewith the Tonquinese usually trade to the neighbouring islands, and\n",
      "putting fourteen men on board, whereof three were of the country, he\n",

      "transacted his affairs at Tonquin.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had not sailed above three days, when a great storm arising, we were\n",
      "driven five days to the north-north-east, and then to the east: after\n",
      "which we had fair weather, but still with a pretty strong gale from the\n",
      "west.  Upon the tenth day we were chased by two pirates, who soon\n",
      "overtook us; for my sloop was so deep laden, that she sailed very slow,\n",
      "neither were we in a condition to defend ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were boarded about the same time by both the pirates, who entered\n",
      "furiously at the head of their men; but finding us all prostrate upon our\n",
      "faces (for so I gave order), they pinioned us with strong ropes, and\n",
      "setting guard upon us, went to search the sloop.\n",
      "\n",
      "I observed among them a Dutchman, who seemed to be of some authority,\n",

      "countenances to be Englishmen, and jabbering to us in his own language,\n",
      "swore we should be tied back to back and thrown into the sea.  I spoken\n",
      "Dutch tolerably well; I told him who we were, and begged him, in\n",
      "consideration of our being Christians and Protestants, of neighbouring\n",
      "countries in strict alliance, that he would move the captains to take\n",
      "some pity on us.  This inflamed his rage; he repeated his threatenings,\n",
      "and turning to his companions, spoke with great vehemence in the Japanese\n",
      "language, as I suppose, often using the word _Christianos_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The largest of the two pirate ships was commanded by a Japanese captain,\n",
      "who spoke a little Dutch, but very imperfectly.  He came up to me, and\n",
      "after several questions, which I answered in great humility, he said, “we\n",
      "should not die.”  I made the captain a very low bow, and then, turning to\n",
      "the Dutchman, said, “I was sorry to find more mercy in a heathen, than in\n",
      "a brother christian.”  But I had soon reason to repent those foolish\n",
      "words: for that malicious reprobate, having often endeavoured in vain to\n",
      "persuade both the captains that I might be thrown into the sea (which\n",
      "they would not yield to, after the promise made me that I should not\n",
      "die), however, prevailed so far, as to have a punishment inflicted on me,\n",
      "worse, in all human appearance, than death itself.  My men were sent by\n",
      "an equal division into both the pirate ships, and my sloop new manned.\n",
      "As to myself, it was determined that I should be set adrift in a small\n",
      "canoe, with paddles and a sail, and four days’ provisions; which last,\n",
      "the Japanese captain was so kind to double out of his own stores, and\n",
      "would permit no man to search me.  I got down into the canoe, while the\n",
      "Dutchman, standing upon the deck, loaded me with all the curses and\n",
      "injurious terms his language could afford.\n",
      "\n",
      "About an hour before we saw the pirates I had taken an observation, and\n",
      "found we were in the latitude of 46 N. and longitude of 183.  When I was\n",
      "at some distance from the pirates, I discovered, by my pocket-glass,\n",
      "several islands to the south-east.  I set up my sail, the wind being\n",
      "fair, with a design to reach the nearest of those islands, which I made a\n",
      "shift to do, in about three hours.  It was all rocky: however I got many\n",
      "birds’ eggs; and, striking fire, I kindled some heath and dry sea-weed,\n",
      "by which I roasted my eggs.  I ate no other supper, being resolved to\n",
      "spare my provisions as much as I could.  I passed the night under the\n",
      "shelter of a rock, strewing some heath under me, and slept pretty well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day I sailed to another island, and thence to a third and\n",
      "fourth, sometimes using my sail, and sometimes my paddles.  But, not to\n",
      "trouble the reader with a particular account of my distresses, let it\n",
      "suffice, that on the fifth day I arrived at the last island in my sight,\n",
      "which lay south-south-east to the former.\n",
      "\n",
      "This island was at a greater distance than I expected, and I did not\n",
      "reach it in less than five hours.  I encompassed it almost round, before\n",
      "I could find a convenient place to land in; which was a small creek,\n",
      "about three times the wideness of my canoe.  I found the island to be all\n",
      "rocky, only a little intermingled with tufts of grass, and sweet-smelling\n",
      "herbs.  I took out my small provisions and after having refreshed myself,\n",
      "I secured the remainder in a cave, whereof there were great numbers; I\n",
      "gathered plenty of eggs upon the rocks, and got a quantity of dry\n",
      "sea-weed, and parched grass, which I designed to kindle the next day, and\n",
      "roast my eggs as well as I could, for I had about me my flint, steel,\n",
      "match, and burning-glass.  I lay all night in the cave where I had lodged\n",
      "my provisions.  My bed was the same dry grass and sea-weed which I\n",
      "intended for fuel.  I slept very little, for the disquiets of my mind\n",
      "prevailed over my weariness, and kept me awake.  I considered how\n",
      "impossible it was to preserve my life in so desolate a place, and how\n",
      "miserable my end must be: yet found myself so listless and desponding,\n",
      "that I had not the heart to rise; and before I could get spirits enough\n",
      "to creep out of my cave, the day was far advanced.  I walked awhile among\n",
      "the rocks: the sky was perfectly clear, and the sun so hot, that I was\n",
      "forced to turn my face from it: when all on a sudden it became obscure,\n",
      "as I thought, in a manner very different from what happens by the\n",
      "interposition of a cloud.  I turned back, and perceived a vast opaque\n",
      "body between me and the sun moving forwards towards the island: it seemed\n",
      "to be about two miles high, and hid the sun six or seven minutes; but I\n",
      "did not observe the air to be much colder, or the sky more darkened, than\n",
      "if I had stood under the shade of a mountain.  As it approached nearer\n",
      "over the place where I was, it appeared to be a firm substance, the\n",
      "bottom flat, smooth, and shining very bright, from the reflection of the\n",
      "sea below.  I stood upon a height about two hundred yards from the shore,\n",
      "and saw this vast body descending almost to a parallel with me, at less\n",
      "than an English mile distance.  I took out my pocket perspective, and\n",
      "could plainly discover numbers of people moving up and down the sides of\n",
      "it, which appeared to be sloping; but what those people where doing I was\n",
      "not able to distinguish.\n",
      "\n",
      "The natural love of life gave me some inward motion of joy, and I was\n",
      "ready to entertain a hope that this adventure might, some way or other,\n",
      "help to deliver me from the desolate place and condition I was in.  But\n",
      "at the same time the reader can hardly conceive my astonishment, to\n",
      "behold an island in the air, inhabited by men, who were able (as it\n",
      "should seem) to raise or sink, or put it into progressive motion, as they\n",
      "pleased.  But not being at that time in a disposition to philosophise\n",
      "upon this phenomenon, I rather chose to observe what course the island\n",
      "would take, because it seemed for awhile to stand still.  Yet soon after,\n",
      "it advanced nearer, and I could see the sides of it encompassed with\n",
      "several gradations of galleries, and stairs, at certain intervals, to\n",
      "descend from one to the other.  In the lowest gallery, I beheld some\n",
      "people fishing with long angling rods, and others looking on.  I waved my\n",
      "cap (for my hat was long since worn out) and my handkerchief toward the\n",
      "island; and upon its nearer approach, I called and shouted with the\n",
      "utmost strength of my voice; and then looking circumspectly, I beheld a\n",
      "crowd gather to that side which was most in my view.  I found by their\n",
      "pointing towards me and to each other, that they plainly discovered me,\n",
      "although they made no return to my shouting.  But I could see four or\n",
      "five men running in great haste, up the stairs, to the top of the island,\n",
      "who then disappeared.  I happened rightly to conjecture, that these were\n",
      "sent for orders to some person in authority upon this occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of people increased, and, in less than half all hour, the\n",
      "island was moved and raised in such a manner, that the lowest gallery\n",
      "appeared in a parallel of less then a hundred yards distance from the\n",
      "height where I stood.  I then put myself in the most supplicating\n",
      "posture, and spoke in the humblest accent, but received no answer.  Those\n",
      "who stood nearest over against me, seemed to be persons of distinction,\n",
      "as I supposed by their habit.  They conferred earnestly with each other,\n",
      "looking often upon me.  At length one of them called out in a clear,\n",
      "polite, smooth dialect, not unlike in sound to the Italian: and therefore\n",
      "I returned an answer in that language, hoping at least that the cadence\n",
      "might be more agreeable to his ears.  Although neither of us understood\n",
      "the other, yet my meaning was easily known, for the people saw the\n",
      "distress I was in.\n",
      "\n",
      "They made signs for me to come down from the rock, and go towards the\n",
      "shore, which I accordingly did; and the flying island being raised to a\n",
      "convenient height, the verge directly over me, a chain was let down from\n",
      "the lowest gallery, with a seat fastened to the bottom, to which I fixed\n",
      "myself, and was drawn up by pulleys.\n",

      "was brought, and four persons of quality, whom I remembered to have seen\n",
      "very near the king’s person, did me the honour to dine with me.  We had\n",
      "two courses, of three dishes each.  In the first course, there was a\n",
      "shoulder of mutton cut into an equilateral triangle, a piece of beef into\n",
      "a rhomboides, and a pudding into a cycloid.  The second course was two\n",
      "ducks trussed up in the form of fiddles; sausages and puddings resembling\n",
      "flutes and hautboys, and a breast of veal in the shape of a harp.  The\n",

      "translations over against them; I likewise made a shift to learn several\n",
      "short sentences; for my tutor would order one of my servants to fetch\n",
      "something, to turn about, to make a bow, to sit, or to stand, or walk,\n",
      "and the like.  Then I took down the sentence in writing.  He showed me\n",
      "also, in one of his books, the figures of the sun, moon, and stars, the\n",
      "zodiac, the tropics, and polar circles, together with the denominations\n",
      "of many plains and solids.  He gave me the names and descriptions of all\n",
      "the musical instruments, and the general terms of art in playing on each\n",
      "of them.  After he had left me, I placed all my words, with their\n",
      "interpretations, in alphabetical order.  And thus, in a few days, by the\n",
      "help of a very faithful memory, I got some insight into their language.\n",

      "_Lapuntuh_.  But I do not approve of this derivation, which seems to be a\n",
      "little strained.  I ventured to offer to the learned among them a\n",
      "conjecture of my own, that Laputa was _quasi lap outed_; _lap_,\n",
      "signifying properly, the dancing of the sunbeams in the sea, and _outed_,\n",

      "owed its several motions, whereof I will now give a philosophical account\n",
      "to the reader.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flying or floating island is exactly circular, its diameter 7837\n",
      "yards, or about four miles and a half, and consequently contains ten\n",
      "thousand acres.  It is three hundred yards thick.  The bottom, or under\n",
      "surface, which appears to those who view it below, is one even regular\n",
      "plate of adamant, shooting up to the height of about two hundred yards.\n",
      "Above it lie the several minerals in their usual order, and over all is a\n",
      "coat of rich mould, ten or twelve feet deep.  The declivity of the upper\n",
      "surface, from the circumference to the centre, is the natural cause why\n",
      "all the dews and rains, which fall upon the island, are conveyed in small\n",
      "rivulets toward the middle, where they are emptied into four large\n",
      "basins, each of about half a mile in circuit, and two hundred yards\n",
      "distant from the centre.  From these basins the water is continually\n",
      "exhaled by the sun in the daytime, which effectually prevents their\n",
      "overflowing.  Besides, as it is in the power of the monarch to raise the\n",
      "island above the region of clouds and vapours, he can prevent the falling\n",
      "of dews and rain whenever he pleases.  For the highest clouds cannot rise\n",
      "above two miles, as naturalists agree, at least they were never known to\n",
      "do so in that country.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the centre of the island there is a chasm about fifty yards in\n",
      "diameter, whence the astronomers descend into a large dome, which is\n",
      "therefore called _flandona gagnole_, or the astronomer’s cave, situated\n",
      "at the depth of a hundred yards beneath the upper surface of the adamant.\n",
      "In this cave are twenty lamps continually burning, which, from the\n",
      "reflection of the adamant, cast a strong light into every part.  The\n",
      "place is stored with great variety of sextants, quadrants, telescopes,\n",
      "astrolabes, and other astronomical instruments.  But the greatest\n",
      "curiosity, upon which the fate of the island depends, is a loadstone of a\n",
      "prodigious size, in shape resembling a weaver’s shuttle.  It is in length\n",
      "six yards, and in the thickest part at least three yards over.  This\n",
      "magnet is sustained by a very strong axle of adamant passing through its\n",
      "middle, upon which it plays, and is poised so exactly that the weakest\n",
      "hand can turn it.  It is hooped round with a hollow cylinder of adamant,\n",
      "four feet yards in diameter, placed horizontally, and supported by eight\n",
      "adamantine feet, each six yards high.  In the middle of the concave side,\n",
      "there is a groove twelve inches deep, in which the extremities of the\n",
      "axle are lodged, and turned round as there is occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stone cannot be removed from its place by any force, because the hoop\n",
      "and its feet are one continued piece with that body of adamant which\n",
      "constitutes the bottom of the island.\n",
      "\n",
      "By means of this loadstone, the island is made to rise and fall, and move\n",
      "from one place to another.  For, with respect to that part of the earth\n",
      "over which the monarch presides, the stone is endued at one of its sides\n",
      "with an attractive power, and at the other with a repulsive.  Upon\n",
      "placing the magnet erect, with its attracting end towards the earth, the\n",
      "island descends; but when the repelling extremity points downwards, the\n",
      "island mounts directly upwards.  When the position of the stone is\n",
      "oblique, the motion of the island is so too: for in this magnet, the\n",
      "forces always act in lines parallel to its direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this oblique motion, the island is conveyed to different parts of the\n",
      "monarch’s dominions.  To explain the manner of its progress, let _A_ _B_\n",
      "represent a line drawn across the dominions of Balnibarbi, let the line\n",
      "_c_ _d_ represent the loadstone, of which let _d_ be the repelling end,\n",
      "and _c_ the attracting end, the island being over _C_: let the stone be\n",
      "placed in position _c_ _d_, with its repelling end downwards; then the\n",
      "island will be driven upwards obliquely towards _D_.  When it is arrived\n",
      "at _D_, let the stone be turned upon its axle, till its attracting end\n",
      "points towards _E_, and then the island will be carried obliquely towards\n",
      "_E_; where, if the stone be again turned upon its axle till it stands in\n",
      "the position _E_ _F_, with its repelling point downwards, the island will\n",
      "rise obliquely towards _F_, where, by directing the attracting end\n",
      "towards _G_, the island may be carried to _G_, and from _G_ to _H_, by\n",
      "turning the stone, so as to make its repelling extremity to point\n",
      "directly downward.  And thus, by changing the situation of the stone, as\n",
      "often as there is occasion, the island is made to rise and fall by turns\n",
      "in an oblique direction, and by those alternate risings and fallings (the\n",
      "obliquity being not considerable) is conveyed from one part of the\n",
      "dominions to the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it must be observed, that this island cannot move beyond the extent\n",
      "of the dominions below, nor can it rise above the height of four miles.\n",
      "For which the astronomers (who have written large systems concerning the\n",
      "stone) assign the following reason: that the magnetic virtue does not\n",
      "extend beyond the distance of four miles, and that the mineral, which\n",
      "acts upon the stone in the bowels of the earth, and in the sea about six\n",
      "leagues distant from the shore, is not diffused through the whole globe,\n",
      "but terminated with the limits of the king’s dominions; and it was easy,\n",
      "from the great advantage of such a superior situation, for a prince to\n",
      "bring under his obedience whatever country lay within the attraction of\n",
      "that magnet.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the stone is put parallel to the plane of the horizon, the island\n",
      "stands still; for in that case the extremities of it, being at equal\n",
      "distance from the earth, act with equal force, the one in drawing\n",
      "downwards, the other in pushing upwards, and consequently no motion can\n",
      "ensue.\n",
      "\n",
      "This loadstone is under the care of certain astronomers, who, from time\n",
      "to time, give it such positions as the monarch directs.  They spend the\n",
      "greatest part of their lives in observing the celestial bodies, which\n",
      "they do by the assistance of glasses, far excelling ours in goodness.\n",
      "For, although their largest telescopes do not exceed three feet, they\n",
      "magnify much more than those of a hundred with us, and show the stars\n",
      "with greater clearness.  This advantage has enabled them to extend their\n",
      "discoveries much further than our astronomers in Europe; for they have\n",
      "made a catalogue of ten thousand fixed stars, whereas the largest of ours\n",
      "do not contain above one third part of that number.  They have likewise\n",
      "discovered two lesser stars, or satellites, which revolve about Mars;\n",
      "whereof the innermost is distant from the centre of the primary planet\n",
      "exactly three of his diameters, and the outermost, five; the former\n",
      "revolves in the space of ten hours, and the latter in twenty-one and a\n",
      "half; so that the squares of their periodical times are very near in the\n",
      "same proportion with the cubes of their distance from the centre of Mars;\n",
      "which evidently shows them to be governed by the same law of gravitation\n",
      "that influences the other heavenly bodies.\n",

      "They have observed ninety-three different comets, and settled their\n",
      "periods with great exactness.  If this be true (and they affirm it with\n",
      "great confidence) it is much to be wished, that their observations were\n",
      "made public, whereby the theory of comets, which at present is very lame\n",

      "enslaving of their country.\n",
      "\n",
      "If any town should engage in rebellion or mutiny, fall into violent\n",
      "factions, or refuse to pay the usual tribute, the king has two methods of\n",
      "reducing them to obedience.  The first and the mildest course is, by\n",
      "keeping the island hovering over such a town, and the lands about it,\n",
      "whereby he can deprive them of the benefit of the sun and the rain, and\n",
      "consequently afflict the inhabitants with dearth and diseases: and if the\n",
      "crime deserve it, they are at the same time pelted from above with great\n",
      "stones, against which they have no defence but by creeping into cellars\n",
      "or caves, while the roofs of their houses are beaten to pieces.  But if\n",
      "they still continue obstinate, or offer to raise insurrections, he\n",
      "proceeds to the last remedy, by letting the island drop directly upon\n",
      "their heads, which makes a universal destruction both of houses and men.\n",
      "However, this is an extremity to which the prince is seldom driven,\n",
      "neither indeed is he willing to put it in execution; nor dare his\n",
      "ministers advise him to an action, which, as it would render them odious\n",
      "to the people, so it would be a great damage to their own estates, which\n",
      "all lie below; for the island is the king’s demesne.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is still indeed a more weighty reason, why the kings of this\n",
      "country have been always averse from executing so terrible an action,\n",
      "unless upon the utmost necessity.  For, if the town intended to be\n",
      "destroyed should have in it any tall rocks, as it generally falls out in\n",
      "the larger cities, a situation probably chosen at first with a view to\n",
      "prevent such a catastrophe; or if it abound in high spires, or pillars of\n",
      "stone, a sudden fall might endanger the bottom or under surface of the\n",
      "island, which, although it consist, as I have said, of one entire\n",
      "adamant, two hundred yards thick, might happen to crack by too great a\n",
      "shock, or burst by approaching too near the fires from the houses below,\n",
      "as the backs, both of iron and stone, will often do in our chimneys.  Of\n",
      "all this the people are well apprised, and understand how far to carry\n",
      "their obstinacy, where their liberty or property is concerned.  And the\n",
      "king, when he is highest provoked, and most determined to press a city to\n",
      "rubbish, orders the island to descend with great gentleness, out of a\n",
      "pretence of tenderness to his people, but, indeed, for fear of breaking\n",
      "the adamantine bottom; in which case, it is the opinion of all their\n",
      "philosophers, that the loadstone could no longer hold it up, and the\n",
      "whole mass would fall to the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "By a fundamental law of this realm, neither the king, nor either of his\n",
      "two eldest sons, are permitted to leave the island; nor the queen, till\n",
      "she is past child-bearing.\n",

      "The author leaves Laputa; is conveyed to Balnibarbi; arrives at the\n",
      "metropolis.  A description of the metropolis, and the country adjoining.\n",
      "The author hospitably received by a great lord.  His conversation with\n",
      "that lord.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I cannot say that I was ill treated in this island, yet I must\n",
      "confess I thought myself too much neglected, not without some degree of\n",
      "contempt; for neither prince nor people appeared to be curious in any\n",
      "part of knowledge, except mathematics and music, wherein I was far their\n",
      "inferior, and upon that account very little regarded.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other side, after having seen all the curiosities of the island, I\n",
      "was very desirous to leave it, being heartily weary of those people.\n",
      "They were indeed excellent in two sciences for which I have great esteem,\n",
      "and wherein I am not unversed; but, at the same time, so abstracted and\n",
      "involved in speculation, that I never met with such disagreeable\n",
      "companions.  I conversed only with women, tradesmen, flappers, and\n",
      "court-pages, during two months of my abode there; by which, at last, I\n",
      "rendered myself extremely contemptible; yet these were the only people\n",
      "from whom I could ever receive a reasonable answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had obtained, by hard study, a good degree of knowledge in their\n",
      "language: I was weary of being confined to an island where I received so\n",
      "little countenance, and resolved to leave it with the first opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a great lord at court, nearly related to the king, and for that\n",
      "reason alone used with respect.  He was universally reckoned the most\n",
      "ignorant and stupid person among them.  He had performed many eminent\n",
      "services for the crown, had great natural and acquired parts, adorned\n",
      "with integrity and honour; but so ill an ear for music, that his\n",
      "detractors reported, “he had been often known to beat time in the wrong\n",
      "place;” neither could his tutors, without extreme difficulty, teach him\n",
      "to demonstrate the most easy proposition in the mathematics.  He was\n",
      "pleased to show me many marks of favour, often did me the honour of a\n",
      "visit, desired to be informed in the affairs of Europe, the laws and\n",
      "customs, the manners and learning of the several countries where I had\n",
      "travelled.  He listened to me with great attention, and made very wise\n",
      "observations on all I spoke.  He had two flappers attending him for\n",
      "state, but never made use of them, except at court and in visits of\n",
      "ceremony, and would always command them to withdraw, when we were alone\n",
      "together.\n",
      "\n",
      "I entreated this illustrious person, to intercede in my behalf with his\n",
      "majesty, for leave to depart; which he accordingly did, as he was pleased\n",
      "to tell me, with regret: for indeed he had made me several offers very\n",
      "advantageous, which, however, I refused, with expressions of the highest\n",
      "acknowledgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the 16th of February I took leave of his majesty and the court.  The\n",
      "king made me a present to the value of about two hundred pounds English,\n",
      "and my protector, his kinsman, as much more, together with a letter of\n",
      "recommendation to a friend of his in Lagado, the metropolis.  The island\n",
      "being then hovering over a mountain about two miles from it, I was let\n",
      "down from the lowest gallery, in the same manner as I had been taken up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The continent, as far as it is subject to the monarch of the flying\n",
      "island, passes under the general name of _Balnibarbi_; and the\n",
      "metropolis, as I said before, is called _Lagado_.  I felt some little\n",
      "satisfaction in finding myself on firm ground.  I walked to the city\n",
      "without any concern, being clad like one of the natives, and sufficiently\n",
      "instructed to converse with them.  I soon found out the person’s house to\n",
      "whom I was recommended, presented my letter from his friend the grandee\n",
      "in the island, and was received with much kindness.  This great lord,\n",
      "whose name was Munodi, ordered me an apartment in his own house, where I\n",
      "continued during my stay, and was entertained in a most hospitable\n",
      "manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning after my arrival, he took me in his chariot to see the\n",
      "town, which is about half the bigness of London; but the houses very\n",
      "strangely built, and most of them out of repair.  The people in the\n",
      "streets walked fast, looked wild, their eyes fixed, and were generally in\n",
      "rags.  We passed through one of the town gates, and went about three\n",
      "miles into the country, where I saw many labourers working with several\n",
      "sorts of tools in the ground, but was not able to conjecture what they\n",
      "were about: neither did observe any expectation either of corn or grass,\n",
      "although the soil appeared to be excellent.  I could not forbear admiring\n",
      "at these odd appearances, both in town and country; and I made bold to\n",
      "desire my conductor, that he would be pleased to explain to me, what\n",
      "could be meant by so many busy heads, hands, and faces, both in the\n",
      "streets and the fields, because I did not discover any good effects they\n",
      "produced; but, on the contrary, I never knew a soil so unhappily\n",
      "cultivated, houses so ill contrived and so ruinous, or a people whose\n",
      "countenances and habit expressed so much misery and want.\n",
      "\n",
      "This lord Munodi was a person of the first rank, and had been some years\n",
      "governor of Lagado; but, by a cabal of ministers, was discharged for\n",
      "insufficiency.  However, the king treated him with tenderness, as a\n",
      "well-meaning man, but of a low contemptible understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I gave that free censure of the country and its inhabitants, he made\n",
      "no further answer than by telling me, “that I had not been long enough\n",
      "among them to form a judgment; and that the different nations of the\n",
      "world had different customs;” with other common topics to the same\n",
      "purpose.  But, when we returned to his palace, he asked me “how I liked\n",
      "the building, what absurdities I observed, and what quarrel I had with\n",
      "the dress or looks of his domestics?”  This he might safely do; because\n",
      "every thing about him was magnificent, regular, and polite.  I answered,\n",
      "“that his excellency’s prudence, quality, and fortune, had exempted him\n",
      "from those defects, which folly and beggary had produced in others.”  He\n",
      "said, “if I would go with him to his country-house, about twenty miles\n",
      "distant, where his estate lay, there would be more leisure for this kind\n",
      "of conversation.”  I told his excellency “that I was entirely at his\n",
      "disposal;” and accordingly we set out next morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "During our journey he made me observe the several methods used by farmers\n",
      "in managing their lands, which to me were wholly unaccountable; for,\n",
      "except in some very few places, I could not discover one ear of corn or\n",
      "blade of grass.  But, in three hours travelling, the scene was wholly\n",
      "altered; we came into a most beautiful country; farmers’ houses, at small\n",
      "distances, neatly built; the fields enclosed, containing vineyards,\n",
      "corn-grounds, and meadows.  Neither do I remember to have seen a more\n",
      "delightful prospect.  His excellency observed my countenance to clear up;\n",
      "he told me, with a sigh, “that there his estate began, and would continue\n",
      "the same, till we should come to his house: that his countrymen ridiculed\n",
      "and despised him, for managing his affairs no better, and for setting so\n",
      "ill an example to the kingdom; which, however, was followed by very few,\n",
      "such as were old, and wilful, and weak like himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We came at length to the house, which was indeed a noble structure, built\n",
      "according to the best rules of ancient architecture.  The fountains,\n",
      "gardens, walks, avenues, and groves, were all disposed with exact\n",
      "judgment and taste.  I gave due praises to every thing I saw, whereof his\n",
      "excellency took not the least notice till after supper; when, there being\n",
      "no third companion, he told me with a very melancholy air “that he\n",
      "doubted he must throw down his houses in town and country, to rebuild\n",
      "them after the present mode; destroy all his plantations, and cast others\n",
      "into such a form as modern usage required, and give the same directions\n",
      "to all his tenants, unless he would submit to incur the censure of pride,\n",
      "singularity, affectation, ignorance, caprice, and perhaps increase his\n",
      "majesty’s displeasure; that the admiration I appeared to be under would\n",
      "cease or diminish, when he had informed me of some particulars which,\n",
      "probably, I never heard of at court, the people there being too much\n",
      "taken up in their own speculations, to have regard to what passed here\n",
      "below.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The sum of his discourse was to this effect: “That about forty years ago,\n",
      "certain persons went up to Laputa, either upon business or diversion,\n",
      "and, after five months continuance, came back with a very little\n",
      "smattering in mathematics, but full of volatile spirits acquired in that\n",
      "airy region: that these persons, upon their return, began to dislike the\n",
      "management of every thing below, and fell into schemes of putting all\n",
      "arts, sciences, languages, and mechanics, upon a new foot.  To this end,\n",
      "they procured a royal patent for erecting an academy of projectors in\n",
      "Lagado; and the humour prevailed so strongly among the people, that there\n",
      "is not a town of any consequence in the kingdom without such an academy.\n",
      "In these colleges the professors contrive new rules and methods of\n",
      "agriculture and building, and new instruments, and tools for all trades\n",
      "and manufactures; whereby, as they undertake, one man shall do the work\n",
      "of ten; a palace may be built in a week, of materials so durable as to\n",
      "last for ever without repairing.  All the fruits of the earth shall come\n",
      "to maturity at whatever season we think fit to choose, and increase a\n",
      "hundred fold more than they do at present; with innumerable other happy\n",
      "proposals.  The only inconvenience is, that none of these projects are\n",
      "yet brought to perfection; and in the mean time, the whole country lies\n",
      "miserably waste, the houses in ruins, and the people without food or\n",
      "clothes.  By all which, instead of being discouraged, they are fifty\n",
      "times more violently bent upon prosecuting their schemes, driven equally\n",
      "on by hope and despair: that as for himself, being not of an enterprising\n",
      "spirit, he was content to go on in the old forms, to live in the houses\n",
      "his ancestors had built, and act as they did, in every part of life,\n",
      "without innovation: that some few other persons of quality and gentry had\n",
      "done the same, but were looked on with an eye of contempt and ill-will,\n",
      "as enemies to art, ignorant, and ill common-wealth’s men, preferring\n",
      "their own ease and sloth before the general improvement of their\n",
      "country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His lordship added, “That he would not, by any further particulars,\n",
      "prevent the pleasure I should certainly take in viewing the grand\n",
      "academy, whither he was resolved I should go.”  He only desired me to\n",
      "observe a ruined building, upon the side of a mountain about three miles\n",
      "distant, of which he gave me this account: “That he had a very convenient\n",
      "mill within half a mile of his house, turned by a current from a large\n",
      "river, and sufficient for his own family, as well as a great number of\n",
      "his tenants; that about seven years ago, a club of those projectors came\n",
      "to him with proposals to destroy this mill, and build another on the side\n",
      "of that mountain, on the long ridge whereof a long canal must be cut, for\n",
      "a repository of water, to be conveyed up by pipes and engines to supply\n",
      "the mill, because the wind and air upon a height agitated the water, and\n",
      "thereby made it fitter for motion, and because the water, descending down\n",
      "a declivity, would turn the mill with half the current of a river whose\n",
      "course is more upon a level.”  He said, “that being then not very well\n",
      "with the court, and pressed by many of his friends, he complied with the\n",
      "proposal; and after employing a hundred men for two years, the work\n",
      "miscarried, the projectors went off, laying the blame entirely upon him,\n",
      "railing at him ever since, and putting others upon the same experiment,\n",
      "with equal assurance of success, as well as equal disappointment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In a few days we came back to town; and his excellency, considering the\n",
      "bad character he had in the academy, would not go with me himself, but\n",
      "recommended me to a friend of his, to bear me company thither.  My lord\n",
      "was pleased to represent me as a great admirer of projects, and a person\n",
      "of much curiosity and easy belief; which, indeed, was not without truth;\n",

      "This academy is not an entire single building, but a continuation of\n",
      "several houses on both sides of a street, which growing waste, was\n",
      "purchased and applied to that use.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was received very kindly by the warden, and went for many days to the\n",
      "academy.  Every room has in it one or more projectors; and I believe I\n",

      "\n",
      "The first man I saw was of a meagre aspect, with sooty hands and face,\n",
      "his hair and beard long, ragged, and singed in several places.  His\n",
      "clothes, shirt, and skin, were all of the same colour.  He has been eight\n",
      "years upon a project for extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers, which were\n",
      "to be put in phials hermetically sealed, and let out to warm the air in\n",
      "raw inclement summers.  He told me, he did not doubt, that, in eight\n",
      "years more, he should be able to supply the governor’s gardens with\n",
      "sunshine, at a reasonable rate: but he complained that his stock was low,\n",
      "and entreated me “to give him something as an encouragement to ingenuity,\n",
      "especially since this had been a very dear season for cucumbers.”  I made\n",
      "him a small present, for my lord had furnished me with money on purpose,\n",
      "because he knew their practice of begging from all who go to see them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went into another chamber, but was ready to hasten back, being almost\n",
      "overcome with a horrible stink.  My conductor pressed me forward,\n",
      "conjuring me in a whisper “to give no offence, which would be highly\n",
      "resented;” and therefore I durst not so much as stop my nose.  The\n",
      "projector of this cell was the most ancient student of the academy; his\n",
      "face and beard were of a pale yellow; his hands and clothes daubed over\n",
      "with filth.  When I was presented to him, he gave me a close embrace, a\n",
      "compliment I could well have excused.  His employment, from his first\n",
      "coming into the academy, was an operation to reduce human excrement to\n",
      "its original food, by separating the several parts, removing the tincture\n",
      "which it receives from the gall, making the odour exhale, and scumming\n",
      "off the saliva.  He had a weekly allowance, from the society, of a vessel\n",
      "filled with human ordure, about the bigness of a Bristol barrel.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw another at work to calcine ice into gunpowder; who likewise showed\n",
      "me a treatise he had written concerning the malleability of fire, which\n",

      "\n",
      "There was a most ingenious architect, who had contrived a new method for\n",
      "building houses, by beginning at the roof, and working downward to the\n",
      "foundation; which he justified to me, by the like practice of those two\n",
      "prudent insects, the bee and the spider.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a man born blind, who had several apprentices in his own\n",
      "condition: their employment was to mix colours for painters, which their\n",
      "master taught them to distinguish by feeling and smelling.  It was indeed\n",
      "my misfortune to find them at that time not very perfect in their\n",
      "lessons, and the professor himself happened to be generally mistaken.\n",
      "This artist is much encouraged and esteemed by the whole fraternity.\n",

      "In another apartment I was highly pleased with a projector who had found\n",
      "a device of ploughing the ground with hogs, to save the charges of\n",
      "ploughs, cattle, and labour.  The method is this: in an acre of ground\n",
      "you bury, at six inches distance and eight deep, a quantity of acorns,\n",
      "dates, chestnuts, and other mast or vegetables, whereof these animals are\n",
      "fondest; then you drive six hundred or more of them into the field,\n",
      "where, in a few days, they will root up the whole ground in search of\n",
      "their food, and make it fit for sowing, at the same time manuring it with\n",
      "their dung: it is true, upon experiment, they found the charge and\n",
      "trouble very great, and they had little or no crop.  However it is not\n",
      "doubted, that this invention may be capable of great improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went into another room, where the walls and ceiling were all hung round\n",
      "with cobwebs, except a narrow passage for the artist to go in and out.\n",
      "At my entrance, he called aloud to me, “not to disturb his webs.”  He\n",
      "lamented “the fatal mistake the world had been so long in, of using\n",
      "silkworms, while we had such plenty of domestic insects who infinitely\n",
      "excelled the former, because they understood how to weave, as well as\n",
      "spin.”  And he proposed further, “that by employing spiders, the charge\n",
      "of dyeing silks should be wholly saved;” whereof I was fully convinced,\n",
      "when he showed me a vast number of flies most beautifully coloured,\n",
      "wherewith he fed his spiders, assuring us “that the webs would take a\n",
      "tincture from them; and as he had them of all hues, he hoped to fit\n",
      "everybody’s fancy, as soon as he could find proper food for the flies, of\n",
      "certain gums, oils, and other glutinous matter, to give a strength and\n",
      "consistence to the threads.”\n",

      "curing that disease, by contrary operations from the same instrument.  He\n",
      "had a large pair of bellows, with a long slender muzzle of ivory: this he\n",
      "conveyed eight inches up the anus, and drawing in the wind, he affirmed\n",
      "he could make the guts as lank as a dried bladder.  But when the disease\n",
      "was more stubborn and violent, he let in the muzzle while the bellows\n",

      "withdrew the instrument to replenish it, clapping his thumb strongly\n",
      "against the orifice of then fundament; and this being repeated three or\n",
      "four times, the adventitious wind would rush out, bringing the noxious\n",
      "along with it, (like water put into a pump), and the patient recovered.\n",
      "I saw him try both experiments upon a dog, but could not discern any\n",
      "effect from the former.  After the latter the animal was ready to burst,\n",
      "and made so violent a discharge as was very offensive to me and my\n",

      "I had hitherto seen only one side of the academy, the other being\n",
      "appropriated to the advancers of speculative learning, of whom I shall\n",
      "say something, when I have mentioned one illustrious person more, who is\n",
      "called among them “the universal artist.”  He told us “he had been thirty\n",
      "years employing his thoughts for the improvement of human life.”  He had\n",
      "two large rooms full of wonderful curiosities, and fifty men at work.\n",
      "Some were condensing air into a dry tangible substance, by extracting the\n",
      "nitre, and letting the aqueous or fluid particles percolate; others\n",
      "softening marble, for pillows and pin-cushions; others petrifying the\n",
      "hoofs of a living horse, to preserve them from foundering.  The artist\n",
      "himself was at that time busy upon two great designs; the first, to sow\n",
      "land with chaff, wherein he affirmed the true seminal virtue to be\n",
      "contained, as he demonstrated by several experiments, which I was not\n",
      "skilful enough to comprehend.  The other was, by a certain composition of\n",
      "gums, minerals, and vegetables, outwardly applied, to prevent the growth\n",
      "of wool upon two young lambs; and he hoped, in a reasonable time to\n",
      "propagate the breed of naked sheep, all over the kingdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "We crossed a walk to the other part of the academy, where, as I have\n",
      "already said, the projectors in speculative learning resided.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first professor I saw, was in a very large room, with forty pupils\n",
      "about him.  After salutation, observing me to look earnestly upon a\n",
      "frame, which took up the greatest part of both the length and breadth of\n",
      "the room, he said, “Perhaps I might wonder to see him employed in a\n",
      "project for improving speculative knowledge, by practical and mechanical\n",
      "operations.  But the world would soon be sensible of its usefulness; and\n",
      "he flattered himself, that a more noble, exalted thought never sprang in\n",
      "any other man’s head.  Every one knew how laborious the usual method is\n",
      "of attaining to arts and sciences; whereas, by his contrivance, the most\n",
      "ignorant person, at a reasonable charge, and with a little bodily labour,\n",
      "might write books in philosophy, poetry, politics, laws, mathematics, and\n",
      "theology, without the least assistance from genius or study.”  He then\n",
      "led me to the frame, about the sides, whereof all his pupils stood in\n",
      "ranks.  It was twenty feet square, placed in the middle of the room.  The\n",
      "superfices was composed of several bits of wood, about the bigness of a\n",
      "die, but some larger than others.  They were all linked together by\n",
      "slender wires.  These bits of wood were covered, on every square, with\n",
      "paper pasted on them; and on these papers were written all the words of\n",
      "their language, in their several moods, tenses, and declensions; but\n",
      "without any order.  The professor then desired me “to observe; for he was\n",
      "going to set his engine at work.”  The pupils, at his command, took each\n",
      "of them hold of an iron handle, whereof there were forty fixed round the\n",
      "edges of the frame; and giving them a sudden turn, the whole disposition\n",
      "of the words was entirely changed.  He then commanded six-and-thirty of\n",
      "the lads, to read the several lines softly, as they appeared upon the\n",
      "frame; and where they found three or four words together that might make\n",
      "part of a sentence, they dictated to the four remaining boys, who were\n",
      "scribes.  This work was repeated three or four times, and at every turn,\n",
      "the engine was so contrived, that the words shifted into new places, as\n",
      "the square bits of wood moved upside down.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Picture: The frame]\n",
      "\n",
      "Six hours a day the young students were employed in this labour; and the\n",
      "professor showed me several volumes in large folio, already collected, of\n",
      "broken sentences, which he intended to piece together, and out of those\n",
      "rich materials, to give the world a complete body of all arts and\n",
      "sciences; which, however, might be still improved, and much expedited, if\n",
      "the public would raise a fund for making and employing five hundred such\n",
      "frames in Lagado, and oblige the managers to contribute in common their\n",
      "several collections.\n",
      "\n",
      "He assured me “that this invention had employed all his thoughts from his\n",
      "youth; that he had emptied the whole vocabulary into his frame, and made\n",
      "the strictest computation of the general proportion there is in books\n",
      "between the numbers of particles, nouns, and verbs, and other parts of\n",
      "speech.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I made my humblest acknowledgment to this illustrious person, for his\n",
      "great communicativeness; and promised, “if ever I had the good fortune to\n",
      "return to my native country, that I would do him justice, as the sole\n",
      "inventor of this wonderful machine;” the form and contrivance of which I\n",
      "desired leave to delineate on paper, as in the figure here annexed.  I\n",
      "told him, “although it were the custom of our learned in Europe to steal\n",
      "inventions from each other, who had thereby at least this advantage, that\n",
      "it became a controversy which was the right owner; yet I would take such\n",
      "caution, that he should have the honour entire, without a rival.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We next went to the school of languages, where three professors sat in\n",
      "consultation upon improving that of their own country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first project was, to shorten discourse, by cutting polysyllables\n",
      "into one, and leaving out verbs and participles, because, in reality, all\n",
      "things imaginable are but norms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other project was, a scheme for entirely abolishing all words\n",
      "whatsoever; and this was urged as a great advantage in point of health,\n",
      "as well as brevity.  For it is plain, that every word we speak is, in\n",
      "some degree, a diminution of our lunge by corrosion, and, consequently,\n",
      "contributes to the shortening of our lives.  An expedient was therefore\n",
      "offered, “that since words are only names for things, it would be more\n",
      "convenient for all men to carry about them such things as were necessary\n",
      "to express a particular business they are to discourse on.”  And this\n",
      "invention would certainly have taken place, to the great ease as well as\n",
      "health of the subject, if the women, in conjunction with the vulgar and\n",
      "illiterate, had not threatened to raise a rebellion unless they might be\n",
      "allowed the liberty to speak with their tongues, after the manner of\n",
      "their forefathers; such constant irreconcilable enemies to science are\n",
      "the common people.  However, many of the most learned and wise adhere to\n",
      "the new scheme of expressing themselves by things; which has only this\n",
      "inconvenience attending it, that if a man’s business be very great, and\n",
      "of various kinds, he must be obliged, in proportion, to carry a greater\n",
      "bundle of things upon his back, unless he can afford one or two strong\n",
      "servants to attend him.  I have often beheld two of those sages almost\n",
      "sinking under the weight of their packs, like pedlars among us, who, when\n",
      "they met in the street, would lay down their loads, open their sacks, and\n",
      "hold conversation for an hour together; then put up their implements,\n",
      "help each other to resume their burdens, and take their leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for short conversations, a man may carry implements in his pockets,\n",
      "and under his arms, enough to supply him; and in his house, he cannot be\n",
      "at a loss.  Therefore the room where company meet who practise this art,\n",
      "is full of all things, ready at hand, requisite to furnish matter for\n",
      "this kind of artificial converse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another great advantage proposed by this invention was, that it would\n",
      "serve as a universal language, to be understood in all civilised nations,\n",
      "whose goods and utensils are generally of the same kind, or nearly\n",
      "resembling, so that their uses might easily be comprehended.  And thus\n",
      "ambassadors would be qualified to treat with foreign princes, or\n",
      "ministers of state, to whose tongues they were utter strangers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was at the mathematical school, where the master taught his pupils\n",
      "after a method scarce imaginable to us in Europe.  The proposition, and\n",
      "demonstration, were fairly written on a thin wafer, with ink composed of\n",
      "a cephalic tincture.  This, the student was to swallow upon a fasting\n",
      "stomach, and for three days following, eat nothing but bread and water.\n",
      "As the wafer digested, the tincture mounted to his brain, bearing the\n",
      "proposition along with it.  But the success has not hitherto been\n",
      "answerable, partly by some error in the _quantum_ or composition, and\n",
      "partly by the perverseness of lads, to whom this bolus is so nauseous,\n",
      "that they generally steal aside, and discharge it upwards, before it can\n",
      "operate; neither have they been yet persuaded to use so long an\n",
      "abstinence, as the prescription requires.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A further account of the academy.  The author proposes some improvements,\n",
      "which are honourably received.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the school of political projectors, I was but ill entertained; the\n",
      "professors appearing, in my judgment, wholly out of their senses, which\n",
      "is a scene that never fails to make me melancholy.  These unhappy people\n",
      "were proposing schemes for persuading monarchs to choose favourites upon\n",
      "the score of their wisdom, capacity, and virtue; of teaching ministers to\n",
      "consult the public good; of rewarding merit, great abilities, eminent\n",
      "services; of instructing princes to know their true interest, by placing\n",
      "it on the same foundation with that of their people; of choosing for\n",
      "employments persons qualified to exercise them, with many other wild,\n",
      "impossible chimeras, that never entered before into the heart of man to\n",
      "conceive; and confirmed in me the old observation, “that there is nothing\n",
      "so extravagant and irrational, which some philosophers have not\n",
      "maintained for truth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, however, I shall so far do justice to this part of the Academy, as\n",
      "to acknowledge that all of them were not so visionary.  There was a most\n",
      "ingenious doctor, who seemed to be perfectly versed in the whole nature\n",
      "and system of government.  This illustrious person had very usefully\n",
      "employed his studies, in finding out effectual remedies for all diseases\n",
      "and corruptions to which the several kinds of public administration are\n",
      "subject, by the vices or infirmities of those who govern, as well as by\n",
      "the licentiousness of those who are to obey.  For instance: whereas all\n",
      "writers and reasoners have agreed, that there is a strict universal\n",
      "resemblance between the natural and the political body; can there be any\n",
      "thing more evident, than that the health of both must be preserved, and\n",
      "the diseases cured, by the same prescriptions?  It is allowed, that\n",
      "senates and great councils are often troubled with redundant, ebullient,\n",
      "and other peccant humours; with many diseases of the head, and more of\n",
      "the heart; with strong convulsions, with grievous contractions of the\n",
      "nerves and sinews in both hands, but especially the right; with spleen,\n",
      "flatus, vertigos, and deliriums; with scrofulous tumours, full of fetid\n",
      "purulent matter; with sour frothy ructations: with canine appetites, and\n",
      "crudeness of digestion, besides many others, needless to mention.  This\n",
      "doctor therefore proposed, “that upon the meeting of the senate, certain\n",
      "physicians should attend it the three first days of their sitting, and at\n",
      "the close of each day’s debate feel the pulses of every senator; after\n",
      "which, having maturely considered and consulted upon the nature of the\n",
      "several maladies, and the methods of cure, they should on the fourth day\n",
      "return to the senate house, attended by their apothecaries stored with\n",
      "proper medicines; and before the members sat, administer to each of them\n",
      "lenitives, aperitives, abstersives, corrosives, restringents,\n",
      "palliatives, laxatives, cephalalgics, icterics, apophlegmatics,\n",
      "acoustics, as their several cases required; and, according as these\n",
      "medicines should operate, repeat, alter, or omit them, at the next\n",
      "meeting.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This project could not be of any great expense to the public; and might\n",
      "in my poor opinion, be of much use for the despatch of business, in those\n",
      "countries where senates have any share in the legislative power; beget\n",
      "unanimity, shorten debates, open a few mouths which are now closed, and\n",
      "close many more which are now open; curb the petulancy of the young, and\n",
      "correct the positiveness of the old; rouse the stupid, and damp the pert.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again: because it is a general complaint, that the favourites of princes\n",
      "are troubled with short and weak memories; the same doctor proposed,\n",
      "“that whoever attended a first minister, after having told his business,\n",
      "with the utmost brevity and in the plainest words, should, at his\n",
      "departure, give the said minister a tweak by the nose, or a kick in the\n",
      "belly, or tread on his corns, or lug him thrice by both ears, or run a\n",
      "pin into his breech; or pinch his arm black and blue, to prevent\n",
      "forgetfulness; and at every levee day, repeat the same operation, till\n",
      "the business were done, or absolutely refused.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He likewise directed, “that every senator in the great council of a\n",
      "nation, after he had delivered his opinion, and argued in the defence of\n",
      "it, should be obliged to give his vote directly contrary; because if that\n",
      "were done, the result would infallibly terminate in the good of the\n",
      "public.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When parties in a state are violent, he offered a wonderful contrivance\n",
      "to reconcile them.  The method is this: You take a hundred leaders of\n",
      "each party; you dispose them into couples of such whose heads are nearest\n",
      "of a size; then let two nice operators saw off the occiput of each couple\n",
      "at the same time, in such a manner that the brain may be equally divided.\n",
      "Let the occiputs, thus cut off, be interchanged, applying each to the\n",
      "head of his opposite party-man.  It seems indeed to be a work that\n",
      "requires some exactness, but the professor assured us, “that if it were\n",
      "dexterously performed, the cure would be infallible.”  For he argued\n",
      "thus: “that the two half brains being left to debate the matter between\n",
      "themselves within the space of one skull, would soon come to a good\n",
      "understanding, and produce that moderation, as well as regularity of\n",
      "thinking, so much to be wished for in the heads of those, who imagine\n",
      "they come into the world only to watch and govern its motion: and as to\n",
      "the difference of brains, in quantity or quality, among those who are\n",
      "directors in faction, the doctor assured us, from his own knowledge, that\n",
      "“it was a perfect trifle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I heard a very warm debate between two professors, about the most\n",
      "commodious and effectual ways and means of raising money, without\n",
      "grieving the subject.  The first affirmed, “the justest method would be,\n",
      "to lay a certain tax upon vices and folly; and the sum fixed upon every\n",
      "man to be rated, after the fairest manner, by a jury of his neighbours.”\n",
      "The second was of an opinion directly contrary; “to tax those qualities\n",
      "of body and mind, for which men chiefly value themselves; the rate to be\n",
      "more or less, according to the degrees of excelling; the decision whereof\n",
      "should be left entirely to their own breast.”  The highest tax was upon\n",
      "men who are the greatest favourites of the other sex, and the\n",
      "assessments, according to the number and nature of the favours they have\n",
      "received; for which, they are allowed to be their own vouchers.  Wit,\n",
      "valour, and politeness, were likewise proposed to be largely taxed, and\n",
      "collected in the same manner, by every person’s giving his own word for\n",
      "the quantum of what he possessed.  But as to honour, justice, wisdom, and\n",
      "learning, they should not be taxed at all; because they are\n",
      "qualifications of so singular a kind, that no man will either allow them\n",
      "in his neighbour or value them in himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The women were proposed to be taxed according to their beauty and skill\n",
      "in dressing, wherein they had the same privilege with the men, to be\n",
      "determined by their own judgment.  But constancy, chastity, good sense,\n",
      "and good nature, were not rated, because they would not bear the charge\n",
      "of collecting.\n",
      "\n",
      "To keep senators in the interest of the crown, it was proposed that the\n",
      "members should raffle for employment; every man first taking an oath, and\n",
      "giving security, that he would vote for the court, whether he won or not;\n",
      "after which, the losers had, in their turn, the liberty of raffling upon\n",
      "the next vacancy.  Thus, hope and expectation would be kept alive; none\n",
      "would complain of broken promises, but impute their disappointments\n",
      "wholly to fortune, whose shoulders are broader and stronger than those of\n",
      "a ministry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another professor showed me a large paper of instructions for discovering\n",
      "plots and conspiracies against the government.  He advised great\n",
      "statesmen to examine into the diet of all suspected persons; their times\n",
      "of eating; upon which side they lay in bed; with which hand they wipe\n",
      "their posteriors; take a strict view of their excrements, and, from the\n",
      "colour, the odour, the taste, the consistence, the crudeness or maturity\n",
      "of digestion, form a judgment of their thoughts and designs; because men\n",
      "are never so serious, thoughtful, and intent, as when they are at stool,\n",
      "which he found by frequent experiment; for, in such conjunctures, when he\n",
      "used, merely as a trial, to consider which was the best way of murdering\n",
      "the king, his ordure would have a tincture of green; but quite different,\n",
      "when he thought only of raising an insurrection, or burning the\n",
      "metropolis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole discourse was written with great acuteness, containing many\n",
      "observations, both curious and useful for politicians; but, as I\n",
      "conceived, not altogether complete.  This I ventured to tell the author,\n",
      "and offered, if he pleased, to supply him with some additions.  He\n",
      "received my proposition with more compliance than is usual among writers,\n",
      "especially those of the projecting species, professing “he would be glad\n",
      "to receive further information.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I told him, “that in the kingdom of Tribnia, {454a} by the natives called\n",
      "Langdon, {454b} where I had sojourned some time in my travels, the bulk\n",
      "of the people consist in a manner wholly of discoverers, witnesses,\n",
      "informers, accusers, prosecutors, evidences, swearers, together with\n",
      "their several subservient and subaltern instruments, all under the\n",
      "colours, the conduct, and the pay of ministers of state, and their\n",
      "deputies.  The plots, in that kingdom, are usually the workmanship of\n",
      "those persons who desire to raise their own characters of profound\n",
      "politicians; to restore new vigour to a crazy administration; to stifle\n",
      "or divert general discontents; to fill their coffers with forfeitures;\n",
      "and raise, or sink the opinion of public credit, as either shall best\n",
      "answer their private advantage.  It is first agreed and settled among\n",
      "them, what suspected persons shall be accused of a plot; then, effectual\n",
      "care is taken to secure all their letters and papers, and put the owners\n",
      "in chains.  These papers are delivered to a set of artists, very\n",
      "dexterous in finding out the mysterious meanings of words, syllables, and\n",
      "letters: for instance, they can discover a close stool, to signify a\n",
      "privy council; a flock of geese, a senate; a lame dog, an invader; the\n",
      "plague, a standing army; a buzzard, a prime minister; the gout, a high\n",
      "priest; a gibbet, a secretary of state; a chamber pot, a committee of\n",
      "grandees; a sieve, a court lady; a broom, a revolution; a mouse-trap, an\n",
      "employment; a bottomless pit, a treasury; a sink, a court; a cap and\n",
      "bells, a favourite; a broken reed, a court of justice; an empty tun, a\n",
      "general; a running sore, the administration. {455}\n",

      "“When this method fails, they have two others more effectual, which the\n",

      "all initial letters into political meanings.  Thus _N_, shall signify a\n",

      "The author leaves Lagado: arrives at Maldonada.  No ship ready.  He takes\n",
      "a short voyage to Glubbdubdrib.  His reception by the governor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The continent, of which this kingdom is apart, extends itself, as I have\n",
      "reason to believe, eastward, to that unknown tract of America westward of\n",
      "California; and north, to the Pacific Ocean, which is not above a hundred\n",
      "and fifty miles from Lagado; where there is a good port, and much\n",
      "commerce with the great island of Luggnagg, situated to the north-west\n",
      "about 29 degrees north latitude, and 140 longitude.  This island of\n",
      "Luggnagg stands south-eastward of Japan, about a hundred leagues distant.\n",
      "There is a strict alliance between the Japanese emperor and the king of\n",
      "Luggnagg; which affords frequent opportunities of sailing from one island\n",
      "to the other.  I determined therefore to direct my course this way, in\n",
      "order to my return to Europe.  I hired two mules, with a guide, to show\n",
      "me the way, and carry my small baggage.  I took leave of my noble\n",
      "protector, who had shown me so much favour, and made me a generous\n",
      "present at my departure.\n",
      "\n",
      "My journey was without any accident or adventure worth relating.  When I\n",
      "arrived at the port of Maldonada (for so it is called) there was no ship\n",
      "in the harbour bound for Luggnagg, nor likely to be in some time.  The\n",
      "town is about as large as Portsmouth.  I soon fell into some\n",
      "acquaintance, and was very hospitably received.  A gentleman of\n",
      "distinction said to me, “that since the ships bound for Luggnagg could\n",
      "not be ready in less than a month, it might be no disagreeable amusement\n",
      "for me to take a trip to the little island of Glubbdubdrib, about five\n",
      "leagues off to the south-west.”  He offered himself and a friend to\n",
      "accompany me, and that I should be provided with a small convenient bark\n",
      "for the voyage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Glubbdubdrib, as nearly as I can interpret the word, signifies the island\n",
      "of sorcerers or magicians.  It is about one third as large as the Isle of\n",
      "Wight, and extremely fruitful: it is governed by the head of a certain\n",
      "tribe, who are all magicians.  This tribe marries only among each other,\n",
      "and the eldest in succession is prince or governor.  He has a noble\n",
      "palace, and a park of about three thousand acres, surrounded by a wall of\n",
      "hewn stone twenty feet high.  In this park are several small enclosures\n",
      "for cattle, corn, and gardening.\n",
      "\n",
      "The governor and his family are served and attended by domestics of a\n",
      "kind somewhat unusual.  By his skill in necromancy he has a power of\n",
      "calling whom he pleases from the dead, and commanding their service for\n",
      "twenty-four hours, but no longer; nor can he call the same persons up\n",
      "again in less than three months, except upon very extraordinary\n",
      "occasions.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we arrived at the island, which was about eleven in the morning, one\n",
      "of the gentlemen who accompanied me went to the governor, and desired\n",
      "admittance for a stranger, who came on purpose to have the honour of\n",
      "attending on his highness.  This was immediately granted, and we all\n",
      "three entered the gate of the palace between two rows of guards, armed\n",
      "and dressed after a very antic manner, and with something in their\n",
      "countenances that made my flesh creep with a horror I cannot express.  We\n",
      "passed through several apartments, between servants of the same sort,\n",
      "ranked on each side as before, till we came to the chamber of presence;\n",
      "where, after three profound obeisances, and a few general questions, we\n",
      "were permitted to sit on three stools, near the lowest step of his\n",
      "highness’s throne.  He understood the language of Balnibarbi, although it\n",
      "was different from that of this island.  He desired me to give him some\n",
      "account of my travels; and, to let me see that I should be treated\n",
      "without ceremony, he dismissed all his attendants with a turn of his\n",
      "finger; at which, to my great astonishment, they vanished in an instant,\n",
      "like visions in a dream when we awake on a sudden.  I could not recover\n",
      "myself in some time, till the governor assured me, “that I should receive\n",
      "no hurt:” and observing my two companions to be under no concern, who had\n",
      "been often entertained in the same manner, I began to take courage, and\n",
      "related to his highness a short history of my several adventures; yet not\n",
      "without some hesitation, and frequently looking behind me to the place\n",
      "where I had seen those domestic spectres.  I had the honour to dine with\n",
      "the governor, where a new set of ghosts served up the meat, and waited at\n",
      "table.  I now observed myself to be less terrified than I had been in the\n",
      "morning.  I stayed till sunset, but humbly desired his highness to excuse\n",
      "me for not accepting his invitation of lodging in the palace.  My two\n",
      "friends and I lay at a private house in the town adjoining, which is the\n",
      "capital of this little island; and the next morning we returned to pay\n",
      "our duty to the governor, as he was pleased to command us.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this manner we continued in the island for ten days, most part of\n",
      "every day with the governor, and at night in our lodging.  I soon grew so\n",
      "familiarized to the sight of spirits, that after the third or fourth time\n",
      "they gave me no emotion at all: or, if I had any apprehensions left, my\n",
      "curiosity prevailed over them.  For his highness the governor ordered me\n",
      "“to call up whatever persons I would choose to name, and in whatever\n",
      "numbers, among all the dead from the beginning of the world to the\n",
      "present time, and command them to answer any questions I should think fit\n",
      "to ask; with this condition, that my questions must be confined within\n",
      "the compass of the times they lived in.  And one thing I might depend\n",
      "upon, that they would certainly tell me the truth, for lying was a talent\n",
      "of no use in the lower world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I made my humble acknowledgments to his highness for so great a favour.\n",
      "We were in a chamber, from whence there was a fair prospect into the\n",
      "park.  And because my first inclination was to be entertained with scenes\n",
      "of pomp and magnificence, I desired to see Alexander the Great at the\n",
      "head of his army, just after the battle of Arbela: which, upon a motion\n",
      "of the governor’s finger, immediately appeared in a large field, under\n",
      "the window where we stood.  Alexander was called up into the room: it was\n",
      "with great difficulty that I understood his Greek, and had but little of\n",
      "my own.  He assured me upon his honour “that he was not poisoned, but\n",
      "died of a bad fever by excessive drinking.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I saw Hannibal passing the Alps, who told me “he had not a drop of\n",
      "vinegar in his camp.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw Cæsar and Pompey at the head of their troops, just ready to engage.\n",
      "I saw the former, in his last great triumph.  I desired that the senate\n",
      "of Rome might appear before me, in one large chamber, and an assembly of\n",
      "somewhat a later age in counterview, in another.  The first seemed to be\n",
      "an assembly of heroes and demigods; the other, a knot of pedlars,\n",
      "pick-pockets, highwayman, and bullies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The governor, at my request, gave the sign for Cæsar and Brutus to\n",
      "advance towards us.  I was struck with a profound veneration at the sight\n",
      "of Brutus, and could easily discover the most consummate virtue, the\n",
      "greatest intrepidity and firmness of mind, the truest love of his\n",
      "country, and general benevolence for mankind, in every lineament of his\n",
      "countenance.  I observed, with much pleasure, that these two persons were\n",
      "in good intelligence with each other; and Cæsar freely confessed to me,\n",
      "“that the greatest actions of his own life were not equal, by many\n",
      "degrees, to the glory of taking it away.”  I had the honour to have much\n",
      "conversation with Brutus; and was told, “that his ancestor Junius,\n",
      "Socrates, Epaminondas, Cato the younger, Sir Thomas More, and himself\n",
      "were perpetually together:” a sextumvirate, to which all the ages of the\n",
      "world cannot add a seventh.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be tedious to trouble the reader with relating what vast numbers\n",
      "of illustrious persons were called up to gratify that insatiable desire I\n",
      "had to see the world in every period of antiquity placed before me.  I\n",
      "chiefly fed mine eyes with beholding the destroyers of tyrants and\n",
      "usurpers, and the restorers of liberty to oppressed and injured nations.\n",
      "But it is impossible to express the satisfaction I received in my own\n",
      "mind, after such a manner as to make it a suitable entertainment to the\n",
      "reader.\n",

      "CHAPTER VIII.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A further account of Glubbdubdrib.  Ancient and modern history corrected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having a desire to see those ancients who were most renowned for wit and\n",
      "learning, I set apart one day on purpose.  I proposed that Homer and\n",
      "Aristotle might appear at the head of all their commentators; but these\n",
      "were so numerous, that some hundreds were forced to attend in the court,\n",
      "and outward rooms of the palace.  I knew, and could distinguish those two\n",
      "heroes, at first sight, not only from the crowd, but from each other.\n",
      "Homer was the taller and comelier person of the two, walked very erect\n",
      "for one of his age, and his eyes were the most quick and piercing I ever\n",
      "beheld.  Aristotle stooped much, and made use of a staff.  His visage was\n",
      "meagre, his hair lank and thin, and his voice hollow.  I soon discovered\n",
      "that both of them were perfect strangers to the rest of the company, and\n",
      "had never seen or heard of them before; and I had a whisper from a ghost\n",
      "who shall be nameless, “that these commentators always kept in the most\n",
      "distant quarters from their principals, in the lower world, through a\n",
      "consciousness of shame and guilt, because they had so horribly\n",
      "misrepresented the meaning of those authors to posterity.”  I introduced\n",
      "Didymus and Eustathius to Homer, and prevailed on him to treat them\n",
      "better than perhaps they deserved, for he soon found they wanted a genius\n",
      "to enter into the spirit of a poet.  But Aristotle was out of all\n",
      "patience with the account I gave him of Scotus and Ramus, as I presented\n",
      "them to him; and he asked them, “whether the rest of the tribe were as\n",
      "great dunces as themselves?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I then desired the governor to call up Descartes and Gassendi, with whom\n",
      "I prevailed to explain their systems to Aristotle.  This great\n",
      "philosopher freely acknowledged his own mistakes in natural philosophy,\n",
      "because he proceeded in many things upon conjecture, as all men must do;\n",
      "and he found that Gassendi, who had made the doctrine of Epicurus as\n",
      "palatable as he could, and the vortices of Descartes, were equally to be\n",
      "exploded.  He predicted the same fate to _attraction_, whereof the\n",
      "present learned are such zealous asserters.  He said, “that new systems\n",
      "of nature were but new fashions, which would vary in every age; and even\n",
      "those, who pretend to demonstrate them from mathematical principles,\n",
      "would flourish but a short period of time, and be out of vogue when that\n",
      "was determined.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I spent five days in conversing with many others of the ancient learned.\n",
      "I saw most of the first Roman emperors.  I prevailed on the governor to\n",
      "call up Heliogabalus’s cooks to dress us a dinner, but they could not\n",
      "show us much of their skill, for want of materials.  A helot of Agesilaus\n",
      "made us a dish of Spartan broth, but I was not able to get down a second\n",
      "spoonful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two gentlemen, who conducted me to the island, were pressed by their\n",
      "private affairs to return in three days, which I employed in seeing some\n",
      "of the modern dead, who had made the greatest figure, for two or three\n",
      "hundred years past, in our own and other countries of Europe; and having\n",
      "been always a great admirer of old illustrious families, I desired the\n",
      "governor would call up a dozen or two of kings, with their ancestors in\n",
      "order for eight or nine generations.  But my disappointment was grievous\n",
      "and unexpected.  For, instead of a long train with royal diadems, I saw\n",
      "in one family two fiddlers, three spruce courtiers, and an Italian\n",
      "prelate.  In another, a barber, an abbot, and two cardinals.  I have too\n",
      "great a veneration for crowned heads, to dwell any longer on so nice a\n",
      "subject.  But as to counts, marquises, dukes, earls, and the like, I was\n",
      "not so scrupulous.  And I confess, it was not without some pleasure, that\n",
      "I found myself able to trace the particular features, by which certain\n",
      "families are distinguished, up to their originals.  I could plainly\n",
      "discover whence one family derives a long chin; why a second has abounded\n",
      "with knaves for two generations, and fools for two more; why a third\n",
      "happened to be crack-brained, and a fourth to be sharpers; whence it\n",
      "came, what Polydore Virgil says of a certain great house, _Nec vir\n",
      "fortis_, _nec foemina casta_; how cruelty, falsehood, and cowardice, grew\n",
      "to be characteristics by which certain families are distinguished as much\n",
      "as by their coats of arms; who first brought the pox into a noble house,\n",
      "which has lineally descended scrofulous tumours to their posterity.\n",
      "Neither could I wonder at all this, when I saw such an interruption of\n",
      "lineages, by pages, lackeys, valets, coachmen, gamesters, fiddlers,\n",
      "players, captains, and pickpockets.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was chiefly disgusted with modern history.  For having strictly\n",
      "examined all the persons of greatest name in the courts of princes, for a\n",
      "hundred years past, I found how the world had been misled by prostitute\n",
      "writers, to ascribe the greatest exploits in war, to cowards; the wisest\n",
      "counsel, to fools; sincerity, to flatterers; Roman virtue, to betrayers\n",
      "of their country; piety, to atheists; chastity, to sodomites; truth, to\n",
      "informers: how many innocent and excellent persons had been condemned to\n",
      "death or banishment by the practising of great ministers upon the\n",
      "corruption of judges, and the malice of factions: how many villains had\n",
      "been exalted to the highest places of trust, power, dignity, and profit:\n",
      "how great a share in the motions and events of courts, councils, and\n",
      "senates might be challenged by bawds, whores, pimps, parasites, and\n",
      "buffoons.  How low an opinion I had of human wisdom and integrity, when I\n",
      "was truly informed of the springs and motives of great enterprises and\n",
      "revolutions in the world, and of the contemptible accidents to which they\n",
      "owed their success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here I discovered the roguery and ignorance of those who pretend to write\n",
      "anecdotes, or secret history; who send so many kings to their graves with\n",
      "a cup of poison; will repeat the discourse between a prince and chief\n",
      "minister, where no witness was by; unlock the thoughts and cabinets of\n",
      "ambassadors and secretaries of state; and have the perpetual misfortune\n",
      "to be mistaken.  Here I discovered the true causes of many great events\n",
      "that have surprised the world; how a whore can govern the back-stairs,\n",
      "the back-stairs a council, and the council a senate.  A general\n",
      "confessed, in my presence, “that he got a victory purely by the force of\n",
      "cowardice and ill conduct;” and an admiral, “that, for want of proper\n",
      "intelligence, he beat the enemy, to whom he intended to betray the\n",
      "fleet.”  Three kings protested to me, “that in their whole reigns they\n",
      "never did once prefer any person of merit, unless by mistake, or\n",
      "treachery of some minister in whom they confided; neither would they do\n",
      "it if they were to live again:” and they showed, with great strength of\n",
      "reason, “that the royal throne could not be supported without corruption,\n",
      "because that positive, confident, restiff temper, which virtue infused\n",
      "into a man, was a perpetual clog to public business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the curiosity to inquire in a particular manner, by what methods\n",
      "great numbers had procured to themselves high titles of honour, and\n",
      "prodigious estates; and I confined my inquiry to a very modern period:\n",
      "however, without grating upon present times, because I would be sure to\n",
      "give no offence even to foreigners (for I hope the reader need not be\n",
      "told, that I do not in the least intend my own country, in what I say\n",
      "upon this occasion,) a great number of persons concerned were called up;\n",
      "and, upon a very slight examination, discovered such a scene of infamy,\n",
      "that I cannot reflect upon it without some seriousness.  Perjury,\n",
      "oppression, subornation, fraud, pandarism, and the like infirmities, were\n",
      "among the most excusable arts they had to mention; and for these I gave,\n",
      "as it was reasonable, great allowance.  But when some confessed they owed\n",
      "their greatness and wealth to sodomy, or incest; others, to the\n",
      "prostituting of their own wives and daughters; others, to the betraying\n",
      "of their country or their prince; some, to poisoning; more to the\n",
      "perverting of justice, in order to destroy the innocent, I hope I may be\n",
      "pardoned, if these discoveries inclined me a little to abate of that\n",
      "profound veneration, which I am naturally apt to pay to persons of high\n",
      "rank, who ought to be treated with the utmost respect due to their\n",
      "sublime dignity, by us their inferiors.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had often read of some great services done to princes and states, and\n",
      "desired to see the persons by whom those services were performed.  Upon\n",
      "inquiry I was told, “that their names were to be found on no record,\n",
      "except a few of them, whom history has represented as the vilest of\n",
      "rogues and traitors.”  As to the rest, I had never once heard of them.\n",
      "They all appeared with dejected looks, and in the meanest habit; most of\n",
      "them telling me, “they died in poverty and disgrace, and the rest on a\n",
      "scaffold or a gibbet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Among others, there was one person, whose case appeared a little\n",
      "singular.  He had a youth about eighteen years old standing by his side.\n",
      "He told me, “he had for many years been commander of a ship; and in the\n",
      "sea fight at Actium had the good fortune to break through the enemy’s\n",
      "great line of battle, sink three of their capital ships, and take a\n",
      "fourth, which was the sole cause of Antony’s flight, and of the victory\n",
      "that ensued; that the youth standing by him, his only son, was killed in\n",
      "the action.”  He added, “that upon the confidence of some merit, the war\n",
      "being at an end, he went to Rome, and solicited at the court of Augustus\n",
      "to be preferred to a greater ship, whose commander had been killed; but,\n",
      "without any regard to his pretensions, it was given to a boy who had\n",
      "never seen the sea, the son of Libertina, who waited on one of the\n",
      "emperor’s mistresses.  Returning back to his own vessel, he was charged\n",
      "with neglect of duty, and the ship given to a favourite page of\n",
      "Publicola, the vice-admiral; whereupon he retired to a poor farm at a\n",
      "great distance from Rome, and there ended his life.”  I was so curious to\n",
      "know the truth of this story, that I desired Agrippa might be called, who\n",
      "was admiral in that fight.  He appeared, and confirmed the whole account:\n",
      "but with much more advantage to the captain, whose modesty had extenuated\n",
      "or concealed a great part of his merit.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was surprised to find corruption grown so high and so quick in that\n",
      "empire, by the force of luxury so lately introduced; which made me less\n",
      "wonder at many parallel cases in other countries, where vices of all\n",
      "kinds have reigned so much longer, and where the whole praise, as well as\n",
      "pillage, has been engrossed by the chief commander, who perhaps had the\n",
      "least title to either.\n",
      "\n",
      "As every person called up made exactly the same appearance he had done in\n",
      "the world, it gave me melancholy reflections to observe how much the race\n",
      "of human kind was degenerated among us within these hundred years past;\n",
      "how the pox, under all its consequences and denominations had altered\n",
      "every lineament of an English countenance; shortened the size of bodies,\n",
      "unbraced the nerves, relaxed the sinews and muscles, introduced a sallow\n",
      "complexion, and rendered the flesh loose and rancid.\n",
      "\n",
      "I descended so low, as to desire some English yeoman of the old stamp\n",
      "might be summoned to appear; once so famous for the simplicity of their\n",
      "manners, diet, and dress; for justice in their dealings; for their true\n",
      "spirit of liberty; for their valour, and love of their country.  Neither\n",
      "could I be wholly unmoved, after comparing the living with the dead, when\n",
      "I considered how all these pure native virtues were prostituted for a\n",
      "piece of money by their grand-children; who, in selling their votes and\n",
      "managing at elections, have acquired every vice and corruption that can\n",

      "necessity of steering westward to get into the trade wind, which holds\n",
      "for above sixty leagues.  On the 21st of April, 1708, we sailed into the\n",
      "river of Clumegnig, which is a seaport town, at the south-east point of\n",
      "Luggnagg.  We cast anchor within a league of the town, and made a signal\n",
      "for a pilot.  Two of them came on board in less than half an hour, by\n",
      "whom we were guided between certain shoals and rocks, which are very\n",
      "dangerous in the passage, to a large basin, where a fleet may ride in\n",
      "safety within a cable’s length of the town-wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of our sailors, whether out of treachery or inadvertence, had\n",
      "informed the pilots “that I was a stranger, and great traveller;” whereof\n",
      "these gave notice to a custom-house officer, by whom I was examined very\n",
      "strictly upon my landing.  This officer spoke to me in the language of\n",
      "Balnibarbi, which, by the force of much commerce, is generally understood\n",
      "in that town, especially by seamen and those employed in the customs.  I\n",
      "gave him a short account of some particulars, and made my story as\n",
      "plausible and consistent as I could; but I thought it necessary to\n",
      "disguise my country, and call myself a Hollander; because my intentions\n",
      "were for Japan, and I knew the Dutch were the only Europeans permitted to\n",
      "enter into that kingdom.  I therefore told the officer, “that having been\n",
      "shipwrecked on the coast of Balnibarbi, and cast on a rock, I was\n",
      "received up into Laputa, or the flying island (of which he had often\n",
      "heard), and was now endeavouring to get to Japan, whence I might find a\n",
      "convenience of returning to my own country.”  The officer said, “I must\n",
      "be confined till he could receive orders from court, for which he would\n",
      "write immediately, and hoped to receive an answer in a fortnight.”  I was\n",
      "carried to a convenient lodging with a sentry placed at the door;\n",
      "however, I had the liberty of a large garden, and was treated with\n",
      "humanity enough, being maintained all the time at the king’s charge.  I\n",
      "was invited by several persons, chiefly out of curiosity, because it was\n",
      "reported that I came from countries very remote, of which they had never\n",
      "heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hired a young man, who came in the same ship, to be an interpreter; he\n",
      "was a native of Luggnagg, but had lived some years at Maldonada, and was\n",
      "a perfect master of both languages.  By his assistance, I was able to\n",
      "hold a conversation with those who came to visit me; but this consisted\n",
      "only of their questions, and my answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The despatch came from court about the time we expected.  It contained a\n",
      "warrant for conducting me and my retinue to _Traldragdubh_, or\n",
      "_Trildrogdrib_ (for it is pronounced both ways as near as I can\n",
      "remember), by a party of ten horse.  All my retinue was that poor lad for\n",
      "an interpreter, whom I persuaded into my service, and, at my humble\n",
      "request, we had each of us a mule to ride on.  A messenger was despatched\n",
      "half a day’s journey before us, to give the king notice of my approach,\n",
      "and to desire, “that his majesty would please to appoint a day and hour,\n",
      "when it would by his gracious pleasure that I might have the honour to\n",
      "lick the dust before his footstool.”  This is the court style, and I\n",
      "found it to be more than matter of form: for, upon my admittance two days\n",
      "after my arrival, I was commanded to crawl upon my belly, and lick the\n",
      "floor as I advanced; but, on account of my being a stranger, care was\n",
      "taken to have it made so clean, that the dust was not offensive.\n",
      "However, this was a peculiar grace, not allowed to any but persons of the\n",
      "highest rank, when they desire an admittance.  Nay, sometimes the floor\n",
      "is strewed with dust on purpose, when the person to be admitted happens\n",
      "to have powerful enemies at court; and I have seen a great lord with his\n",
      "mouth so crammed, that when he had crept to the proper distance from the\n",
      "throne; he was not able to speak a word.  Neither is there any remedy;\n",
      "because it is capital for those, who receive an audience to spit or wipe\n",
      "their mouths in his majesty’s presence.  There is indeed another custom,\n",
      "which I cannot altogether approve of: when the king has a mind to put any\n",
      "of his nobles to death in a gentle indulgent manner, he commands the\n",
      "floor to be strewed with a certain brown powder of a deadly composition,\n",
      "which being licked up, infallibly kills him in twenty-four hours.  But in\n",
      "justice to this prince’s great clemency, and the care he has of his\n",
      "subjects’ lives (wherein it were much to be wished that the Monarchs of\n",
      "Europe would imitate him), it must be mentioned for his honour, that\n",
      "strict orders are given to have the infected parts of the floor well\n",
      "washed after every such execution, which, if his domestics neglect, they\n",
      "are in danger of incurring his royal displeasure.  I myself heard him\n",
      "give directions, that one of his pages should be whipped, whose turn it\n",
      "was to give notice about washing the floor after an execution, but\n",
      "maliciously had omitted it; by which neglect a young lord of great hopes,\n",
      "coming to an audience, was unfortunately poisoned, although the king at\n",
      "that time had no design against his life.  But this good prince was so\n",
      "gracious as to forgive the poor page his whipping, upon promise that he\n",
      "would do so no more, without special orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "To return from this digression.  When I had crept within four yards of\n",
      "the throne, I raised myself gently upon my knees, and then striking my\n",
      "forehead seven times against the ground, I pronounced the following\n",
      "words, as they had been taught me the night before, _Inckpling\n",

      "rendered into English thus: “May your celestial majesty outlive the sun,\n",
      "eleven moons and a half!”  To this the king returned some answer, which,\n",
      "although I could not understand, yet I replied as I had been directed:\n",
      "_Fluft drin yalerick dwuldom prastrad mirpush_, which properly signifies,\n",
      "“My tongue is in the mouth of my friend;” and by this expression was\n",
      "meant, that I desired leave to bring my interpreter; whereupon the young\n",
      "man already mentioned was accordingly introduced, by whose intervention I\n",
      "answered as many questions as his majesty could put in above an hour.  I\n",
      "spoke in the Balnibarbian tongue, and my interpreter delivered my meaning\n",
      "in that of Luggnagg.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king was much delighted with my company, and ordered his\n",
      "_bliffmarklub_, or high-chamberlain, to appoint a lodging in the court\n",
      "for me and my interpreter; with a daily allowance for my table, and a\n",
      "large purse of gold for my common expenses.\n",

      "The Luggnaggians commended.  A particular description of the Struldbrugs,\n",
      "with many conversations between the author and some eminent persons upon\n",
      "that subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Luggnaggians are a polite and generous people; and although they are\n",
      "not without some share of that pride which is peculiar to all Eastern\n",
      "countries, yet they show themselves courteous to strangers, especially\n",
      "such who are countenanced by the court.  I had many acquaintance, and\n",
      "among persons of the best fashion; and being always attended by my\n",
      "interpreter, the conversation we had was not disagreeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, in much good company, I was asked by a person of quality,\n",
      "“whether I had seen any of their _struldbrugs_, or immortals?”  I said,\n",
      "“I had not;” and desired he would explain to me “what he meant by such an\n",
      "appellation, applied to a mortal creature.”  He told me “that sometimes,\n",
      "though very rarely, a child happened to be born in a family, with a red\n",
      "circular spot in the forehead, directly over the left eyebrow, which was\n",
      "an infallible mark that it should never die.”  The spot, as he described\n",
      "it, “was about the compass of a silver threepence, but in the course of\n",
      "time grew larger, and changed its colour; for at twelve years old it\n",
      "became green, so continued till five and twenty, then turned to a deep\n",
      "blue: at five and forty it grew coal black, and as large as an English\n",
      "shilling; but never admitted any further alteration.”  He said, “these\n",
      "births were so rare, that he did not believe there could be above eleven\n",
      "hundred struldbrugs, of both sexes, in the whole kingdom; of which he\n",
      "computed about fifty in the metropolis, and, among the rest, a young girl\n",
      "born; about three years ago: that these productions were not peculiar to\n",
      "any family, but a mere effect of chance; and the children of the\n",
      "_struldbrugs_ themselves were equally mortal with the rest of the\n",
      "people.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I freely own myself to have been struck with inexpressible delight, upon\n",
      "hearing this account: and the person who gave it me happening to\n",
      "understand the Balnibarbian language, which I spoke very well, I could\n",
      "not forbear breaking out into expressions, perhaps a little too\n",
      "extravagant.  I cried out, as in a rapture, “Happy nation, where every\n",
      "child hath at least a chance for being immortal!  Happy people, who enjoy\n",
      "so many living examples of ancient virtue, and have masters ready to\n",
      "instruct them in the wisdom of all former ages! but happiest, beyond all\n",
      "comparison, are those excellent _struldbrugs_, who, being born exempt\n",
      "from that universal calamity of human nature, have their minds free and\n",
      "disengaged, without the weight and depression of spirits caused by the\n",
      "continual apprehensions of death!”  I discovered my admiration that I had\n",
      "not observed any of these illustrious persons at court; the black spot on\n",
      "the forehead being so remarkable a distinction, that I could not have\n",
      "easily overlooked it: and it was impossible that his majesty, a most\n",
      "judicious prince, should not provide himself with a good number of such\n",
      "wise and able counsellors.  Yet perhaps the virtue of those reverend\n",
      "sages was too strict for the corrupt and libertine manners of a court:\n",
      "and we often find by experience, that young men are too opinionated and\n",
      "volatile to be guided by the sober dictates of their seniors.  However,\n",
      "since the king was pleased to allow me access to his royal person, I was\n",
      "resolved, upon the very first occasion, to deliver my opinion to him on\n",
      "this matter freely and at large, by the help of my interpreter; and\n",
      "whether he would please to take my advice or not, yet in one thing I was\n",
      "determined, that his majesty having frequently offered me an\n",
      "establishment in this country, I would, with great thankfulness, accept\n",
      "the favour, and pass my life here in the conversation of those superior\n",

      "The gentleman to whom I addressed my discourse, because (as I have\n",
      "already observed) he spoke the language of Balnibarbi, said to me, with a\n",
      "sort of a smile which usually arises from pity to the ignorant, “that he\n",
      "was glad of any occasion to keep me among them, and desired my permission\n",
      "to explain to the company what I had spoke.”  He did so, and they talked\n",
      "together for some time in their own language, whereof I understood not a\n",
      "syllable, neither could I observe by their countenances, what impression\n",
      "my discourse had made on them.  After a short silence, the same person\n",
      "told me, “that his friends and mine (so he thought fit to express\n",
      "himself) were very much pleased with the judicious remarks I had made on\n",
      "the great happiness and advantages of immortal life, and they were\n",
      "desirous to know, in a particular manner, what scheme of living I should\n",

      "visions of what I should do, if I were a king, a general, or a great\n",
      "lord: and upon this very case, I had frequently run over the whole system\n",
      "how I should employ myself, and pass the time, if I were sure to live for\n",
      "ever.\n",

      "resolve, by all arts and methods, whatsoever, to procure myself riches.\n",
      "In the pursuit of which, by thrift and management, I might reasonably\n",
      "expect, in about two hundred years, to be the wealthiest man in the\n",
      "kingdom.  In the second place, I would, from my earliest youth, apply\n",
      "myself to the study of arts and sciences, by which I should arrive in\n",
      "time to excel all others in learning.  Lastly, I would carefully record\n",
      "every action and event of consequence, that happened in the public,\n",
      "impartially draw the characters of the several successions of princes and\n",
      "great ministers of state, with my own observations on every point.  I\n",
      "would exactly set down the several changes in customs, language, fashions\n",
      "of dress, diet, and diversions.  By all which acquirements, I should be a\n",

      "“I would never marry after threescore, but live in a hospitable manner,\n",

      "among whom, I would elect a dozen from the most ancient, down to my own\n",
      "contemporaries.  Where any of these wanted fortunes, I would provide them\n",
      "with convenient lodges round my own estate, and have some of them always\n",
      "at my table; only mingling a few of the most valuable among you mortals,\n",
      "whom length of time would harden me to lose with little or no reluctance,\n",
      "and treat your posterity after the same manner; just as a man diverts\n",

      "by giving perpetual warning and instruction to mankind; which, added to\n",

      "lessening into shallow brooks; the ocean leaving one coast dry, and\n",
      "overwhelming another; the discovery of many countries yet unknown;\n",
      "barbarity overrunning the politest nations, and the most barbarous become\n",
      "civilized.  I should then see the discovery of the longitude, the\n",

      "mentioned, where, during his residence, he had conversed very much, he\n",
      "observed long life to be the universal desire and wish of mankind.  That\n",

      "strongly as he could.  That the oldest had still hopes of living one day\n",
      "longer, and looked on death as the greatest evil, from which nature\n",
      "always prompted him to retreat.  Only in this island of Luggnagg the\n",

      "wishes.  That the question therefore was not, whether a man would choose\n",
      "to be always in the prime of youth, attended with prosperity and health;\n",
      "but how he would pass a perpetual life under all the usual disadvantages\n",
      "which old age brings along with it.  For although few men will avow their\n",
      "desires of being immortal, upon such hard conditions, yet in the two\n",
      "kingdoms before mentioned, of Balnibarbi and Japan, he observed that\n",

      "After this preface, he gave me a particular account of the _struldbrugs_\n",

      "years old; after which, by degrees, they grew melancholy and dejected,\n",
      "increasing in both till they came to fourscore.  This he learned from\n",
      "their own confession: for otherwise, there not being above two or three\n",
      "of that species born in an age, they were too few to form a general\n",
      "observation by.  When they came to fourscore years, which is reckoned the\n",
      "extremity of living in this country, they had not only all the follies\n",
      "and infirmities of other old men, but many more which arose from the\n",
      "dreadful prospect of never dying.  They were not only opinionative,\n",
      "peevish, covetous, morose, vain, talkative, but incapable of friendship,\n",
      "and dead to all natural affection, which never descended below their\n",
      "grandchildren.  Envy and impotent desires are their prevailing passions.\n",
      "But those objects against which their envy seems principally directed,\n",
      "are the vices of the younger sort and the deaths of the old.  By\n",
      "reflecting on the former, they find themselves cut off from all\n",
      "possibility of pleasure; and whenever they see a funeral, they lament and\n",
      "repine that others have gone to a harbour of rest to which they\n",
      "themselves never can hope to arrive.  They have no remembrance of\n",
      "anything but what they learned and observed in their youth and\n",
      "middle-age, and even that is very imperfect; and for the truth or\n",
      "particulars of any fact, it is safer to depend on common tradition, than\n",
      "upon their best recollections.  The least miserable among them appear to\n",
      "be those who turn to dotage, and entirely lose their memories; these meet\n",

      "reasonable indulgence, that those who are condemned, without any fault of\n",

      "order, “that I should signify my request, and, whatever it were, it\n",
      "should be granted, for the sake of his royal brother of Luggnagg.”  This\n",
      "interpreter was a person employed to transact affairs with the\n",
      "Hollanders.  He soon conjectured, by my countenance, that I was a\n",
      "European, and therefore repeated his majesty’s commands in Low Dutch,\n",
      "which he spoke perfectly well.  I answered, as I had before determined,\n",
      "“that I was a Dutch merchant, shipwrecked in a very remote country,\n",

      "therefore most humbly entreated his royal favour, to give order that I\n",

      "who ever made any scruple in this point; and that he began to doubt,\n",
      "whether I was a real Hollander, or not; but rather suspected I must be a\n",
      "Christian.  However, for the reasons I had offered, but chiefly to\n",
      "gratify the king of Luggnagg by an uncommon mark of his favour, he would\n",
      "comply with the singularity of my humour; but the affair must be managed\n",
      "with dexterity, and his officers should be commanded to let me pass, as\n",
      "it were by forgetfulness.  For he assured me, that if the secret should\n",
      "be discovered by my countrymen the Dutch, they would cut my throat in the\n",
      "voyage.”  I returned my thanks, by the interpreter, for so unusual a\n",
      "favour; and some troops being at that time on their march to Nangasac,\n",

      "short and probable as I could, but concealed the greatest part.  I knew\n",
      "many persons in Holland.  I was able to invent names for my parents, whom\n",
      "I pretended to be obscure people in the province of Gelderland.  I would\n",
      "have given the captain (one Theodorus Vangrult) what he pleased to ask\n",

      "contented to take half the usual rate, on condition that I would serve\n",

      "Bristol, at Teneriffe, who was going to the bay of Campechy to cut\n",

      "charged, who was commanded to shoot me dead if I attempted my liberty.\n",

      "Upon the 9th day of May, 1711, one James Welch came down to my cabin, and\n",
      "said, “he had orders from the captain to set me ashore.”  I expostulated\n",
      "with him, but in vain; neither would he so much as tell me who their new\n",
      "captain was.  They forced me into the long-boat, letting me put on my\n",
      "best suit of clothes, which were as good as new, and take a small bundle\n",
      "of linen, but no arms, except my hanger; and they were so civil as not to\n",

      "other little necessaries.  They rowed about a league, and then set me\n",
      "down on a strand.  I desired them to tell me what country it was.  They\n",
      "all swore, “they knew no more than myself;” but said, “that the captain”\n",
      "(as they called him) “was resolved, after they had sold the lading, to\n",
      "get rid of me in the first place where they could discover land.”  They\n",
      "pushed off immediately, advising me to make haste for fear of being\n",
      "overtaken by the tide, and so bade me farewell.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this desolate condition I advanced forward, and soon got upon firm\n",
      "ground, where I sat down on a bank to rest myself, and consider what I\n",
      "had best do.  When I was a little refreshed, I went up into the country,\n",
      "resolving to deliver myself to the first savages I should meet, and\n",
      "purchase my life from them by some bracelets, glass rings, and other\n",
      "toys, which sailors usually provide themselves with in those voyages, and\n",
      "whereof I had some about me.  The land was divided by long rows of trees,\n",
      "not regularly planted, but naturally growing; there was great plenty of\n",
      "grass, and several fields of oats.  I walked very circumspectly, for fear\n",
      "of being surprised, or suddenly shot with an arrow from behind, or on\n",
      "either side.  I fell into a beaten road, where I saw many tracts of human\n",
      "feet, and some of cows, but most of horses.  At last I beheld several\n",
      "animals in a field, and one or two of the same kind sitting in trees.\n",
      "Their shape was very singular and deformed, which a little discomposed\n",
      "me, so that I lay down behind a thicket to observe them better.  Some of\n",
      "them coming forward near the place where I lay, gave me an opportunity of\n",
      "distinctly marking their form.  Their heads and breasts were covered with\n",
      "a thick hair, some frizzled, and others lank; they had beards like goats,\n",
      "and a long ridge of hair down their backs, and the fore parts of their\n",
      "legs and feet; but the rest of their bodies was bare, so that I might see\n",
      "their skins, which were of a brown buff colour.  They had no tails, nor\n",
      "any hair at all on their buttocks, except about the anus, which, I\n",
      "presume, nature had placed there to defend them as they sat on the\n",
      "ground, for this posture they used, as well as lying down, and often\n",
      "stood on their hind feet.  They climbed high trees as nimbly as a\n",
      "squirrel, for they had strong extended claws before and behind,\n",
      "terminating in sharp points, and hooked.  They would often spring, and\n",
      "bound, and leap, with prodigious agility.  The females were not so large\n",
      "as the males; they had long lank hair on their heads, but none on their\n",
      "faces, nor any thing more than a sort of down on the rest of their\n",
      "bodies, except about the anus and pudenda.  The dugs hung between their\n",
      "fore feet, and often reached almost to the ground as they walked.  The\n",
      "hair of both sexes was of several colours, brown, red, black, and yellow.\n",
      "Upon the whole, I never beheld, in all my travels, so disagreeable an\n",
      "animal, or one against which I naturally conceived so strong an\n",
      "antipathy.  So that, thinking I had seen enough, full of contempt and\n",
      "aversion, I got up, and pursued the beaten road, hoping it might direct\n",
      "me to the cabin of some Indian.  I had not got far, when I met one of\n",
      "these creatures full in my way, and coming up directly to me.  The ugly\n",
      "monster, when he saw me, distorted several ways, every feature of his\n",
      "visage, and stared, as at an object he had never seen before; then\n",
      "approaching nearer, lifted up his fore-paw, whether out of curiosity or\n",
      "mischief I could not tell; but I drew my hanger, and gave him a good blow\n",
      "with the flat side of it, for I durst not strike with the edge, fearing\n",
      "the inhabitants might be provoked against me, if they should come to know\n",
      "that I had killed or maimed any of their cattle.  When the beast felt the\n",
      "smart, he drew back, and roared so loud, that a herd of at least forty\n",
      "came flocking about me from the next field, howling and making odious\n",
      "faces; but I ran to the body of a tree, and leaning my back against it,\n",
      "kept them off by waving my hanger.  Several of this cursed brood, getting\n",
      "hold of the branches behind, leaped up into the tree, whence they began\n",
      "to discharge their excrements on my head; however, I escaped pretty well\n",
      "by sticking close to the stem of the tree, but was almost stifled with\n",
      "the filth, which fell about me on every side.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the midst of this distress, I observed them all to run away on a\n",
      "sudden as fast as they could; at which I ventured to leave the tree and\n",
      "pursue the road, wondering what it was that could put them into this\n",
      "fright.  But looking on my left hand, I saw a horse walking softly in the\n",
      "field; which my persecutors having sooner discovered, was the cause of\n",
      "their flight.  The horse started a little, when he came near me, but soon\n",
      "recovering himself, looked full in my face with manifest tokens of\n",
      "wonder; he viewed my hands and feet, walking round me several times.  I\n",
      "would have pursued my journey, but he placed himself directly in the way,\n",
      "yet looking with a very mild aspect, never offering the least violence.\n",
      "We stood gazing at each other for some time; at last I took the boldness\n",
      "to reach my hand towards his neck with a design to stroke it, using the\n",
      "common style and whistle of jockeys, when they are going to handle a\n",
      "strange horse.  But this animal seemed to receive my civilities with\n",
      "disdain, shook his head, and bent his brows, softly raising up his right\n",
      "fore-foot to remove my hand.  Then he neighed three or four times, but in\n",
      "so different a cadence, that I almost began to think he was speaking to\n",
      "himself, in some language of his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he and I were thus employed, another horse came up; who applying\n",
      "himself to the first in a very formal manner, they gently struck each\n",
      "other’s right hoof before, neighing several times by turns, and varying\n",
      "the sound, which seemed to be almost articulate.  They went some paces\n",
      "off, as if it were to confer together, walking side by side, backward and\n",
      "forward, like persons deliberating upon some affair of weight, but often\n",
      "turning their eyes towards me, as it were to watch that I might not\n",
      "escape.  I was amazed to see such actions and behaviour in brute beasts;\n",
      "and concluded with myself, that if the inhabitants of this country were\n",
      "endued with a proportionable degree of reason, they must needs be the\n",
      "wisest people upon earth.  This thought gave me so much comfort, that I\n",
      "resolved to go forward, until I could discover some house or village, or\n",
      "meet with any of the natives, leaving the two horses to discourse\n",
      "together as they pleased.  But the first, who was a dapple gray,\n",
      "observing me to steal off, neighed after me in so expressive a tone, that\n",
      "I fancied myself to understand what he meant; whereupon I turned back,\n",
      "and came near to him to expect his farther commands: but concealing my\n",
      "fear as much as I could, for I began to be in some pain how this\n",
      "adventure might terminate; and the reader will easily believe I did not\n",
      "much like my present situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two horses came up close to me, looking with great earnestness upon\n",
      "my face and hands.  The gray steed rubbed my hat all round with his right\n",
      "fore-hoof, and discomposed it so much that I was forced to adjust it\n",
      "better by taking it off and settling it again; whereat, both he and his\n",
      "companion (who was a brown bay) appeared to be much surprised: the latter\n",
      "felt the lappet of my coat, and finding it to hang loose about me, they\n",
      "both looked with new signs of wonder.  He stroked my right hand, seeming\n",
      "to admire the softness and colour; but he squeezed it so hard between his\n",
      "hoof and his pastern, that I was forced to roar; after which they both\n",
      "touched me with all possible tenderness.  They were under great\n",
      "perplexity about my shoes and stockings, which they felt very often,\n",
      "neighing to each other, and using various gestures, not unlike those of a\n",
      "philosopher, when he would attempt to solve some new and difficult\n",
      "phenomenon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon the whole, the behaviour of these animals was so orderly and\n",
      "rational, so acute and judicious, that I at last concluded they must\n",
      "needs be magicians, who had thus metamorphosed themselves upon some\n",
      "design, and seeing a stranger in the way, resolved to divert themselves\n",
      "with him; or, perhaps, were really amazed at the sight of a man so very\n",
      "different in habit, feature, and complexion, from those who might\n",
      "probably live in so remote a climate.  Upon the strength of this\n",
      "reasoning, I ventured to address them in the following manner:\n",
      "“Gentlemen, if you be conjurers, as I have good cause to believe, you can\n",
      "understand my language; therefore I make bold to let your worships know\n",
      "that I am a poor distressed Englishman, driven by his misfortunes upon\n",
      "your coast; and I entreat one of you to let me ride upon his back, as if\n",
      "he were a real horse, to some house or village where I can be relieved.\n",
      "In return of which favour, I will make you a present of this knife and\n",
      "bracelet,” taking them out of my pocket.  The two creatures stood silent\n",
      "while I spoke, seeming to listen with great attention, and when I had\n",
      "ended, they neighed frequently towards each other, as if they were\n",
      "engaged in serious conversation.  I plainly observed that their language\n",
      "expressed the passions very well, and the words might, with little pains,\n",
      "be resolved into an alphabet more easily than the Chinese.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could frequently distinguish the word _Yahoo_, which was repeated by\n",
      "each of them several times: and although it was impossible for me to\n",
      "conjecture what it meant, yet while the two horses were busy in\n",
      "conversation, I endeavoured to practise this word upon my tongue; and as\n",
      "soon as they were silent, I boldly pronounced _Yahoo_ in a loud voice,\n",
      "imitating at the same time, as near as I could, the neighing of a horse;\n",
      "at which they were both visibly surprised; and the gray repeated the same\n",
      "word twice, as if he meant to teach me the right accent; wherein I spoke\n",
      "after him as well as I could, and found myself perceivably to improve\n",
      "every time, though very far from any degree of perfection.  Then the bay\n",
      "tried me with a second word, much harder to be pronounced; but reducing\n",
      "it to the English orthography, may be spelt thus, _Houyhnhnm_.  I did not\n",
      "succeed in this so well as in the former; but after two or three farther\n",
      "trials, I had better fortune; and they both appeared amazed at my\n",
      "capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "After some further discourse, which I then conjectured might relate to\n",
      "me, the two friends took their leaves, with the same compliment of\n",
      "striking each other’s hoof; and the gray made me signs that I should walk\n",
      "before him; wherein I thought it prudent to comply, till I could find a\n",
      "better director.  When I offered to slacken my pace, he would cry _hhuun\n",
      "hhuun_: I guessed his meaning, and gave him to understand, as well as I\n",
      "could, “that I was weary, and not able to walk faster;” upon which he\n",
      "would stand awhile to let me rest.\n",

      "in this country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having travelled about three miles, we came to a long kind of building,\n",
      "made of timber stuck in the ground, and wattled across; the roof was low\n",
      "and covered with straw.  I now began to be a little comforted; and took\n",
      "out some toys, which travellers usually carry for presents to the savage\n",
      "Indians of America, and other parts, in hopes the people of the house\n",
      "would be thereby encouraged to receive me kindly.  The horse made me a\n",
      "sign to go in first; it was a large room with a smooth clay floor, and a\n",
      "rack and manger, extending the whole length on one side.  There were\n",
      "three nags and two mares, not eating, but some of them sitting down upon\n",
      "their hams, which I very much wondered at; but wondered more to see the\n",
      "rest employed in domestic business; these seemed but ordinary cattle.\n",
      "However, this confirmed my first opinion, that a people who could so far\n",
      "civilise brute animals, must needs excel in wisdom all the nations of the\n",
      "world.  The gray came in just after, and thereby prevented any ill\n",
      "treatment which the others might have given me.  He neighed to them\n",
      "several times in a style of authority, and received answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond this room there were three others, reaching the length of the\n",
      "house, to which you passed through three doors, opposite to each other,\n",
      "in the manner of a vista.  We went through the second room towards the\n",
      "third.  Here the gray walked in first, beckoning me to attend: I waited\n",
      "in the second room, and got ready my presents for the master and mistress\n",
      "of the house; they were two knives, three bracelets of false pearls, a\n",
      "small looking-glass, and a bead necklace.  The horse neighed three or\n",
      "four times, and I waited to hear some answers in a human voice, but I\n",
      "heard no other returns than in the same dialect, only one or two a little\n",
      "shriller than his.  I began to think that this house must belong to some\n",
      "person of great note among them, because there appeared so much ceremony\n",
      "before I could gain admittance.  But, that a man of quality should be\n",
      "served all by horses, was beyond my comprehension.  I feared my brain was\n",
      "disturbed by my sufferings and misfortunes.  I roused myself, and looked\n",
      "about me in the room where I was left alone: this was furnished like the\n",
      "first, only after a more elegant manner.  I rubbed my eyes often, but the\n",
      "same objects still occurred.  I pinched my arms and sides to awake\n",
      "myself, hoping I might be in a dream.  I then absolutely concluded, that\n",
      "all these appearances could be nothing else but necromancy and magic.\n",
      "But I had no time to pursue these reflections; for the gray horse came to\n",
      "the door, and made me a sign to follow him into the third room where I\n",
      "saw a very comely mare, together with a colt and foal, sitting on their\n",
      "haunches upon mats of straw, not unartfully made, and perfectly neat and\n",
      "clean.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mare soon after my entrance rose from her mat, and coming up close,\n",
      "after having nicely observed my hands and face, gave me a most\n",
      "contemptuous look; and turning to the horse, I heard the word _Yahoo_\n",
      "often repeated betwixt them; the meaning of which word I could not then\n",
      "comprehend, although it was the first I had learned to pronounce.  But I\n",
      "was soon better informed, to my everlasting mortification; for the horse,\n",
      "beckoning to me with his head, and repeating the _hhuun_, _hhuun_, as he\n",
      "did upon the road, which I understood was to attend him, led me out into\n",
      "a kind of court, where was another building, at some distance from the\n",
      "house.  Here we entered, and I saw three of those detestable creatures,\n",
      "which I first met after my landing, feeding upon roots, and the flesh of\n",
      "some animals, which I afterwards found to be that of asses and dogs, and\n",
      "now and then a cow, dead by accident or disease.  They were all tied by\n",
      "the neck with strong withes fastened to a beam; they held their food\n",
      "between the claws of their fore feet, and tore it with their teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The master horse ordered a sorrel nag, one of his servants, to untie the\n",
      "largest of these animals, and take him into the yard.  The beast and I\n",
      "were brought close together, and by our countenances diligently compared\n",
      "both by master and servant, who thereupon repeated several times the word\n",
      "_Yahoo_.  My horror and astonishment are not to be described, when I\n",
      "observed in this abominable animal, a perfect human figure: the face of\n",
      "it indeed was flat and broad, the nose depressed, the lips large, and the\n",
      "mouth wide; but these differences are common to all savage nations, where\n",
      "the lineaments of the countenance are distorted, by the natives suffering\n",
      "their infants to lie grovelling on the earth, or by carrying them on\n",
      "their backs, nuzzling with their face against the mothers’ shoulders.\n",
      "The fore-feet of the _Yahoo_ differed from my hands in nothing else but\n",
      "the length of the nails, the coarseness and brownness of the palms, and\n",
      "the hairiness on the backs.  There was the same resemblance between our\n",
      "feet, with the same differences; which I knew very well, though the\n",
      "horses did not, because of my shoes and stockings; the same in every part\n",
      "of our bodies except as to hairiness and colour, which I have already\n",
      "described.\n",
      "\n",
      "The great difficulty that seemed to stick with the two horses, was to see\n",
      "the rest of my body so very different from that of a _Yahoo_, for which I\n",
      "was obliged to my clothes, whereof they had no conception.  The sorrel\n",
      "nag offered me a root, which he held (after their manner, as we shall\n",
      "describe in its proper place) between his hoof and pastern; I took it in\n",
      "my hand, and, having smelt it, returned it to him again as civilly as I\n",
      "could.  He brought out of the _Yahoos_’ kennel a piece of ass’s flesh;\n",
      "but it smelt so offensively that I turned from it with loathing: he then\n",
      "threw it to the _Yahoo_, by whom it was greedily devoured.  He afterwards\n",
      "showed me a wisp of hay, and a fetlock full of oats; but I shook my head,\n",
      "to signify that neither of these were food for me.  And indeed I now\n",
      "apprehended that I must absolutely starve, if I did not get to some of my\n",
      "own species; for as to those filthy _Yahoos_, although there were few\n",
      "greater lovers of mankind at that time than myself, yet I confess I never\n",
      "saw any sensitive being so detestable on all accounts; and the more I\n",
      "came near them the more hateful they grew, while I stayed in that\n",
      "country.  This the master horse observed by my behaviour, and therefore\n",
      "sent the _Yahoo_ back to his kennel.  He then put his fore-hoof to his\n",
      "mouth, at which I was much surprised, although he did it with ease, and\n",
      "with a motion that appeared perfectly natural, and made other signs, to\n",
      "know what I would eat; but I could not return him such an answer as he\n",
      "was able to apprehend; and if he had understood me, I did not see how it\n",
      "was possible to contrive any way for finding myself nourishment.  While\n",
      "we were thus engaged, I observed a cow passing by, whereupon I pointed to\n",
      "her, and expressed a desire to go and milk her.  This had its effect; for\n",
      "he led me back into the house, and ordered a mare-servant to open a room,\n",
      "where a good store of milk lay in earthen and wooden vessels, after a\n",
      "very orderly and cleanly manner.  She gave me a large bowlful, of which I\n",
      "drank very heartily, and found myself well refreshed.\n",
      "\n",
      "About noon, I saw coming towards the house a kind of vehicle drawn like a\n",
      "sledge by four _Yahoos_.  There was in it an old steed, who seemed to be\n",
      "of quality; he alighted with his hind-feet forward, having by accident\n",
      "got a hurt in his left fore-foot.  He came to dine with our horse, who\n",
      "received him with great civility.  They dined in the best room, and had\n",
      "oats boiled in milk for the second course, which the old horse ate warm,\n",
      "but the rest cold.  Their mangers were placed circular in the middle of\n",
      "the room, and divided into several partitions, round which they sat on\n",
      "their haunches, upon bosses of straw.  In the middle was a large rack,\n",
      "with angles answering to every partition of the manger; so that each\n",
      "horse and mare ate their own hay, and their own mash of oats and milk,\n",
      "with much decency and regularity.  The behaviour of the young colt and\n",
      "foal appeared very modest, and that of the master and mistress extremely\n",
      "cheerful and complaisant to their guest.  The gray ordered me to stand by\n",
      "him; and much discourse passed between him and his friend concerning me,\n",
      "as I found by the stranger’s often looking on me, and the frequent\n",
      "repetition of the word _Yahoo_.\n",
      "\n",
      "I happened to wear my gloves, which the master gray observing, seemed\n",
      "perplexed, discovering signs of wonder what I had done to my fore-feet.\n",
      "He put his hoof three or four times to them, as if he would signify, that\n",
      "I should reduce them to their former shape, which I presently did,\n",
      "pulling off both my gloves, and putting them into my pocket.  This\n",
      "occasioned farther talk; and I saw the company was pleased with my\n",
      "behaviour, whereof I soon found the good effects.  I was ordered to speak\n",
      "the few words I understood; and while they were at dinner, the master\n",
      "taught me the names for oats, milk, fire, water, and some others, which I\n",
      "could readily pronounce after him, having from my youth a great facility\n",
      "in learning languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "When dinner was done, the master horse took me aside, and by signs and\n",
      "words made me understand the concern he was in that I had nothing to eat.\n",
      "Oats in their tongue are called _hlunnh_.  This word I pronounced two or\n",
      "three times; for although I had refused them at first, yet, upon second\n",
      "thoughts, I considered that I could contrive to make of them a kind of\n",
      "bread, which might be sufficient, with milk, to keep me alive, till I\n",
      "could make my escape to some other country, and to creatures of my own\n",
      "species.  The horse immediately ordered a white mare servant of his\n",
      "family to bring me a good quantity of oats in a sort of wooden tray.\n",
      "These I heated before the fire, as well as I could, and rubbed them till\n",
      "the husks came off, which I made a shift to winnow from the grain.  I\n",
      "ground and beat them between two stones; then took water, and made them\n",
      "into a paste or cake, which I toasted at the fire and eat warm with milk.\n",
      "It was at first a very insipid diet, though common enough in many parts\n",
      "of Europe, but grew tolerable by time; and having been often reduced to\n",
      "hard fare in my life, this was not the first experiment I had made how\n",
      "easily nature is satisfied.  And I cannot but observe, that I never had\n",
      "one hours sickness while I stayed in this island.  It is true, I\n",
      "sometimes made a shift to catch a rabbit, or bird, by springs made of\n",
      "_Yahoo’s_ hairs; and I often gathered wholesome herbs, which I boiled,\n",
      "and ate as salads with my bread; and now and then, for a rarity, I made a\n",
      "little butter, and drank the whey.  I was at first at a great loss for\n",
      "salt, but custom soon reconciled me to the want of it; and I am confident\n",
      "that the frequent use of salt among us is an effect of luxury, and was\n",
      "first introduced only as a provocative to drink, except where it is\n",
      "necessary for preserving flesh in long voyages, or in places remote from\n",
      "great markets; for we observe no animal to be fond of it but man, and as\n",
      "to myself, when I left this country, it was a great while before I could\n",
      "endure the taste of it in anything that I ate.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is enough to say upon the subject of my diet, wherewith other\n",
      "travellers fill their books, as if the readers were personally concerned\n",
      "whether we fare well or ill.  However, it was necessary to mention this\n",
      "matter, lest the world should think it impossible that I could find\n",
      "sustenance for three years in such a country, and among such inhabitants.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it grew towards evening, the master horse ordered a place for me to\n",
      "lodge in; it was but six yards from the house and separated from the\n",
      "stable of the _Yahoos_.  Here I got some straw, and covering myself with\n",
      "my own clothes, slept very sound.  But I was in a short time better\n",
      "accommodated, as the reader shall know hereafter, when I come to treat\n",
      "more particularly about my way of living.\n",

      "short account of his voyage.\n",
      "\n",
      "My principal endeavour was to learn the language, which my master (for so\n",
      "I shall henceforth call him), and his children, and every servant of his\n",
      "house, were desirous to teach me; for they looked upon it as a prodigy,\n",
      "that a brute animal should discover such marks of a rational creature.  I\n",
      "pointed to every thing, and inquired the name of it, which I wrote down\n",
      "in my journal-book when I was alone, and corrected my bad accent by\n",
      "desiring those of the family to pronounce it often.  In this employment,\n",
      "a sorrel nag, one of the under-servants, was very ready to assist me.\n",
      "\n",
      "In speaking, they pronounced through the nose and throat, and their\n",
      "language approaches nearest to the High-Dutch, or German, of any I know\n",
      "in Europe; but is much more graceful and significant.  The emperor\n",
      "Charles V. made almost the same observation, when he said “that if he\n",
      "were to speak to his horse, it should be in High-Dutch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The curiosity and impatience of my master were so great, that he spent\n",
      "many hours of his leisure to instruct me.  He was convinced (as he\n",
      "afterwards told me) that I must be a _Yahoo_; but my teachableness,\n",
      "civility, and cleanliness, astonished him; which were qualities\n",
      "altogether opposite to those animals.  He was most perplexed about my\n",
      "clothes, reasoning sometimes with himself, whether they were a part of my\n",
      "body: for I never pulled them off till the family were asleep, and got\n",
      "them on before they waked in the morning.  My master was eager to learn\n",
      "“whence I came; how I acquired those appearances of reason, which I\n",
      "discovered in all my actions; and to know my story from my own mouth,\n",
      "which he hoped he should soon do by the great proficiency I made in\n",
      "learning and pronouncing their words and sentences.”  To help my memory,\n",
      "I formed all I learned into the English alphabet, and writ the words\n",
      "down, with the translations.  This last, after some time, I ventured to\n",
      "do in my master’s presence.  It cost me much trouble to explain to him\n",
      "what I was doing; for the inhabitants have not the least idea of books or\n",
      "literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "In about ten weeks time, I was able to understand most of his questions;\n",
      "and in three months, could give him some tolerable answers.  He was\n",
      "extremely curious to know “from what part of the country I came, and how\n",
      "I was taught to imitate a rational creature; because the _Yahoos_ (whom\n",
      "he saw I exactly resembled in my head, hands, and face, that were only\n",
      "visible), with some appearance of cunning, and the strongest disposition\n",
      "to mischief, were observed to be the most unteachable of all brutes.”  I\n",
      "answered, “that I came over the sea, from a far place, with many others\n",
      "of my own kind, in a great hollow vessel made of the bodies of trees:\n",
      "that my companions forced me to land on this coast, and then left me to\n",
      "shift for myself.”  It was with some difficulty, and by the help of many\n",
      "signs, that I brought him to understand me.  He replied, “that I must\n",
      "needs be mistaken, or that I said the thing which was not;” for they have\n",
      "no word in their language to express lying or falsehood.  “He knew it was\n",
      "impossible that there could be a country beyond the sea, or that a parcel\n",
      "of brutes could move a wooden vessel whither they pleased upon water.  He\n",

      "_Yahoos_ to manage it.”\n",

      "a loss for expression, but would improve as fast as I could; and hoped,\n",
      "in a short time, I should be able to tell him wonders.”  He was pleased\n",
      "to direct his own mare, his colt, and foal, and the servants of the\n",
      "family, to take all opportunities of instructing me; and every day, for\n",
      "two or three hours, he was at the same pains himself.  Several horses and\n",
      "mares of quality in the neighbourhood came often to our house, upon the\n",
      "report spread of “a wonderful _Yahoo_, that could speak like a\n",
      "_Houyhnhnm_, and seemed, in his words and actions, to discover some\n",
      "glimmerings of reason.”  These delighted to converse with me: they put\n",
      "many questions, and received such answers as I was able to return.  By\n",
      "all these advantages I made so great a progress, that, in five months\n",
      "from my arrival I understood whatever was spoken, and could express\n",
      "myself tolerably well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The _Houyhnhnms_, who came to visit my master out of a design of seeing\n",
      "and talking with me, could hardly believe me to be a right _Yahoo_,\n",
      "because my body had a different covering from others of my kind.  They\n",
      "were astonished to observe me without the usual hair or skin, except on\n",
      "my head, face, and hands; but I discovered that secret to my master upon\n",
      "an accident which happened about a fortnight before.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have already told the reader, that every night, when the family were\n",
      "gone to bed, it was my custom to strip, and cover myself with my clothes.\n",
      "It happened, one morning early, that my master sent for me by the sorrel\n",
      "nag, who was his valet.  When he came I was fast asleep, my clothes\n",
      "fallen off on one side, and my shirt above my waist.  I awaked at the\n",
      "noise he made, and observed him to deliver his message in some disorder;\n",
      "after which he went to my master, and in a great fright gave him a very\n",
      "confused account of what he had seen.  This I presently discovered, for,\n",
      "going as soon as I was dressed to pay my attendance upon his honour, he\n",
      "asked me “the meaning of what his servant had reported, that I was not\n",
      "the same thing when I slept, as I appeared to be at other times; that his\n",
      "vale assured him, some part of me was white, some yellow, at least not so\n",
      "white, and some brown.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I had hitherto concealed the secret of my dress, in order to distinguish\n",
      "myself, as much as possible, from that cursed race of _Yahoos_; but now I\n",
      "found it in vain to do so any longer.  Besides, I considered that my\n",
      "clothes and shoes would soon wear out, which already were in a declining\n",
      "condition, and must be supplied by some contrivance from the hides of\n",
      "_Yahoos_, or other brutes; whereby the whole secret would be known.  I\n",
      "therefore told my master, “that in the country whence I came, those of my\n",
      "kind always covered their bodies with the hairs of certain animals\n",
      "prepared by art, as well for decency as to avoid the inclemencies of air,\n",
      "both hot and cold; of which, as to my own person, I would give him\n",
      "immediate conviction, if he pleased to command me: only desiring his\n",
      "excuse, if I did not expose those parts that nature taught us to\n",
      "conceal.”  He said, “my discourse was all very strange, but especially\n",
      "the last part; for he could not understand, why nature should teach us to\n",
      "conceal what nature had given; that neither himself nor family were\n",
      "ashamed of any parts of their bodies; but, however, I might do as I\n",
      "pleased.”  Whereupon I first unbuttoned my coat, and pulled it off.  I\n",
      "did the same with my waistcoat.  I drew off my shoes, stockings, and\n",
      "breeches.  I let my shirt down to my waist, and drew up the bottom;\n",
      "fastening it like a girdle about my middle, to hide my nakedness.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master observed the whole performance with great signs of curiosity\n",
      "and admiration.  He took up all my clothes in his pastern, one piece\n",
      "after another, and examined them diligently; he then stroked my body very\n",
      "gently, and looked round me several times; after which, he said, it was\n",
      "plain I must be a perfect _Yahoo_; but that I differed very much from the\n",
      "rest of my species in the softness, whiteness, and smoothness of my skin;\n",
      "my want of hair in several parts of my body; the shape and shortness of\n",
      "my claws behind and before; and my affectation of walking continually on\n",
      "my two hinder feet.  He desired to see no more; and gave me leave to put\n",
      "on my clothes again, for I was shuddering with cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "I expressed my uneasiness at his giving me so often the appellation of\n",
      "_Yahoo_, an odious animal, for which I had so utter a hatred and\n",
      "contempt: I begged he would forbear applying that word to me, and make\n",
      "the same order in his family and among his friends whom he suffered to\n",
      "see me.  I requested likewise, “that the secret of my having a false\n",
      "covering to my body, might be known to none but himself, at least as long\n",
      "as my present clothing should last; for as to what the sorrel nag, his\n",
      "valet, had observed, his honour might command him to conceal it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "All this my master very graciously consented to; and thus the secret was\n",
      "kept till my clothes began to wear out, which I was forced to supply by\n",
      "several contrivances that shall hereafter be mentioned.  In the meantime,\n",
      "he desired “I would go on with my utmost diligence to learn their\n",
      "language, because he was more astonished at my capacity for speech and\n",
      "reason, than at the figure of my body, whether it were covered or not;”\n",
      "adding, “that he waited with some impatience to hear the wonders which I\n",
      "promised to tell him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thenceforward he doubled the pains he had been at to instruct me: he\n",
      "brought me into all company, and made them treat me with civility;\n",
      "“because,” as he told them, privately, “this would put me into good\n",
      "humour, and make me more diverting.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Every day, when I waited on him, beside the trouble he was at in\n",
      "teaching, he would ask me several questions concerning myself, which I\n",
      "answered as well as I could, and by these means he had already received\n",
      "some general ideas, though very imperfect.  It would be tedious to relate\n",
      "the several steps by which I advanced to a more regular conversation; but\n",
      "the first account I gave of myself in any order and length was to this\n",
      "purpose:\n",
      "\n",
      "“That I came from a very far country, as I already had attempted to tell\n",
      "him, with about fifty more of my own species; that we travelled upon the\n",
      "seas in a great hollow vessel made of wood, and larger than his honour’s\n",
      "house.  I described the ship to him in the best terms I could, and\n",
      "explained, by the help of my handkerchief displayed, how it was driven\n",
      "forward by the wind.  That upon a quarrel among us, I was set on shore on\n",
      "this coast, where I walked forward, without knowing whither, till he\n",
      "delivered me from the persecution of those execrable _Yahoos_.”  He asked\n",
      "me, “who made the ship, and how it was possible that the _Houyhnhnms_ of\n",
      "my country would leave it to the management of brutes?”  My answer was,\n",
      "“that I durst proceed no further in my relation, unless he would give me\n",
      "his word and honour that he would not be offended, and then I would tell\n",
      "him the wonders I had so often promised.”  He agreed; and I went on by\n",
      "assuring him, that the ship was made by creatures like myself; who, in\n",
      "all the countries I had travelled, as well as in my own, were the only\n",
      "governing rational animals; and that upon my arrival hither, I was as\n",
      "much astonished to see the _Houyhnhnms_ act like rational beings, as he,\n",
      "or his friends, could be, in finding some marks of reason in a creature\n",
      "he was pleased to call a _Yahoo_; to which I owned my resemblance in\n",
      "every part, but could not account for their degenerate and brutal nature.\n",
      "I said farther, “that if good fortune ever restored me to my native\n",
      "country, to relate my travels hither, as I resolved to do, everybody\n",
      "would believe, that I said the thing that was not, that I invented the\n",
      "story out of my own head; and (with all possible respect to himself, his\n",
      "family, and friends, and under his promise of not being offended) our\n",
      "countrymen would hardly think it probable that a _Houyhnhnm_ should be\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Houyhnhnm’s notion of truth and falsehood.  The author’s discourse\n",
      "disapproved by his master.  The author gives a more particular account of\n",
      "himself, and the accidents of his voyage.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master heard me with great appearances of uneasiness in his\n",
      "countenance; because doubting, or not believing, are so little known in\n",
      "this country, that the inhabitants cannot tell how to behave themselves\n",
      "under such circumstances.  And I remember, in frequent discourses with my\n",
      "master concerning the nature of manhood in other parts of the world,\n",
      "having occasion to talk of lying and false representation, it was with\n",
      "much difficulty that he comprehended what I meant, although he had\n",
      "otherwise a most acute judgment.  For he argued thus: “that the use of\n",
      "speech was to make us understand one another, and to receive information\n",
      "of facts; now, if any one said the thing which was not, these ends were\n",
      "defeated, because I cannot properly be said to understand him; and I am\n",
      "so far from receiving information, that he leaves me worse than in\n",
      "ignorance; for I am led to believe a thing black, when it is white, and\n",
      "short, when it is long.”  And these were all the notions he had\n",
      "concerning that faculty of lying, so perfectly well understood, and so\n",
      "universally practised, among human creatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "To return from this digression.  When I asserted that the _Yahoos_ were\n",
      "the only governing animals in my country, which my master said was\n",
      "altogether past his conception, he desired to know, “whether we had\n",
      "_Houyhnhnms_ among us, and what was their employment?”  I told him, “we\n",
      "had great numbers; that in summer they grazed in the fields, and in\n",
      "winter were kept in houses with hay and oats, where _Yahoo_ servants were\n",
      "employed to rub their skins smooth, comb their manes, pick their feet,\n",
      "serve them with food, and make their beds.”  “I understand you well,”\n",
      "said my master: “it is now very plain, from all you have spoken, that\n",
      "whatever share of reason the _Yahoos_ pretend to, the _Houyhnhnms_ are\n",
      "your masters; I heartily wish our _Yahoos_ would be so tractable.”  I\n",
      "begged “his honour would please to excuse me from proceeding any further,\n",
      "because I was very certain that the account he expected from me would be\n",
      "highly displeasing.”  But he insisted in commanding me to let him know\n",
      "the best and the worst.  I told him “he should be obeyed.”  I owned “that\n",
      "the _Houyhnhnms_ among us, whom we called horses, were the most generous\n",
      "and comely animals we had; that they excelled in strength and swiftness;\n",
      "and when they belonged to persons of quality, were employed in\n",
      "travelling, racing, or drawing chariots; they were treated with much\n",
      "kindness and care, till they fell into diseases, or became foundered in\n",
      "the feet; but then they were sold, and used to all kind of drudgery till\n",
      "they died; after which their skins were stripped, and sold for what they\n",
      "were worth, and their bodies left to be devoured by dogs and birds of\n",
      "prey.  But the common race of horses had not so good fortune, being kept\n",
      "by farmers and carriers, and other mean people, who put them to greater\n",
      "labour, and fed them worse.”  I described, as well as I could, our way of\n",
      "riding; the shape and use of a bridle, a saddle, a spur, and a whip; of\n",
      "harness and wheels.  I added, “that we fastened plates of a certain hard\n",
      "substance, called iron, at the bottom of their feet, to preserve their\n",
      "hoofs from being broken by the stony ways, on which we often travelled.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My master, after some expressions of great indignation, wondered “how we\n",
      "dared to venture upon a _Houyhnhnm’s_ back; for he was sure, that the\n",
      "weakest servant in his house would be able to shake off the strongest\n",
      "_Yahoo_; or by lying down and rolling on his back, squeeze the brute to\n",
      "death.”  I answered “that our horses were trained up, from three or four\n",
      "years old, to the several uses we intended them for; that if any of them\n",
      "proved intolerably vicious, they were employed for carriages; that they\n",
      "were severely beaten, while they were young, for any mischievous tricks;\n",
      "that the males, designed for the common use of riding or draught, were\n",
      "generally castrated about two years after their birth, to take down their\n",
      "spirits, and make them more tame and gentle; that they were indeed\n",
      "sensible of rewards and punishments; but his honour would please to\n",
      "consider, that they had not the least tincture of reason, any more than\n",
      "the _Yahoos_ in this country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It put me to the pains of many circumlocutions, to give my master a right\n",
      "idea of what I spoke; for their language does not abound in variety of\n",
      "words, because their wants and passions are fewer than among us.  But it\n",
      "is impossible to express his noble resentment at our savage treatment of\n",
      "the _Houyhnhnm_ race; particularly after I had explained the manner and\n",
      "use of castrating horses among us, to hinder them from propagating their\n",
      "kind, and to render them more servile.  He said, “if it were possible\n",
      "there could be any country where _Yahoos_ alone were endued with reason,\n",
      "they certainly must be the governing animal; because reason in time will\n",
      "always prevail against brutal strength.  But, considering the frame of\n",
      "our bodies, and especially of mine, he thought no creature of equal bulk\n",
      "was so ill-contrived for employing that reason in the common offices of\n",
      "life;” whereupon he desired to know “whether those among whom I lived\n",
      "resembled me, or the _Yahoos_ of his country?”  I assured him, “that I\n",
      "was as well shaped as most of my age; but the younger, and the females,\n",
      "were much more soft and tender, and the skins of the latter generally as\n",
      "white as milk.”  He said, “I differed indeed from other _Yahoos_, being\n",
      "much more cleanly, and not altogether so deformed; but, in point of real\n",
      "advantage, he thought I differed for the worse: that my nails were of no\n",
      "use either to my fore or hinder feet; as to my fore feet, he could not\n",
      "properly call them by that name, for he never observed me to walk upon\n",
      "them; that they were too soft to bear the ground; that I generally went\n",
      "with them uncovered; neither was the covering I sometimes wore on them of\n",
      "the same shape, or so strong as that on my feet behind: that I could not\n",
      "walk with any security, for if either of my hinder feet slipped, I must\n",
      "inevitably fail.”  He then began to find fault with other parts of my\n",
      "body: “the flatness of my face, the prominence of my nose, mine eyes\n",
      "placed directly in front, so that I could not look on either side without\n",
      "turning my head: that I was not able to feed myself, without lifting one\n",
      "of my fore-feet to my mouth: and therefore nature had placed those joints\n",
      "to answer that necessity.  He knew not what could be the use of those\n",
      "several clefts and divisions in my feet behind; that these were too soft\n",
      "to bear the hardness and sharpness of stones, without a covering made\n",
      "from the skin of some other brute; that my whole body wanted a fence\n",
      "against heat and cold, which I was forced to put on and off every day,\n",
      "with tediousness and trouble: and lastly, that he observed every animal\n",
      "in this country naturally to abhor the _Yahoos_, whom the weaker avoided,\n",
      "and the stronger drove from them.  So that, supposing us to have the gift\n",
      "of reason, he could not see how it were possible to cure that natural\n",
      "antipathy, which every creature discovered against us; nor consequently\n",
      "how we could tame and render them serviceable.  However, he would,” as he\n",
      "said, “debate the matter no farther, because he was more desirous to know\n",
      "my own story, the country where I was born, and the several actions and\n",
      "events of my life, before I came hither.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I assured him, “how extremely desirous I was that he should be satisfied\n",
      "on every point; but I doubted much, whether it would be possible for me\n",
      "to explain myself on several subjects, whereof his honour could have no\n",
      "conception; because I saw nothing in his country to which I could\n",
      "resemble them; that, however, I would do my best, and strive to express\n",
      "myself by similitudes, humbly desiring his assistance when I wanted\n",
      "proper words;” which he was pleased to promise me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said, “my birth was of honest parents, in an island called England;\n",
      "which was remote from his country, as many days’ journey as the strongest\n",
      "of his honour’s servants could travel in the annual course of the sun;\n",
      "that I was bred a surgeon, whose trade it is to cure wounds and hurts in\n",
      "the body, gotten by accident or violence; that my country was governed by\n",
      "a female man, whom we called queen; that I left it to get riches, whereby\n",
      "I might maintain myself and family, when I should return; that, in my\n",
      "last voyage, I was commander of the ship, and had about fifty _Yahoos_\n",
      "under me, many of which died at sea, and I was forced to supply them by\n",
      "others picked out from several nations; that our ship was twice in danger\n",
      "of being sunk, the first time by a great storm, and the second by\n",
      "striking against a rock.”  Here my master interposed, by asking me, “how\n",
      "I could persuade strangers, out of different countries, to venture with\n",
      "me, after the losses I had sustained, and the hazards I had run?”  I\n",
      "said, “they were fellows of desperate fortunes, forced to fly from the\n",
      "places of their birth on account of their poverty or their crimes.  Some\n",
      "were undone by lawsuits; others spent all they had in drinking, whoring,\n",
      "and gaming; others fled for treason; many for murder, theft, poisoning,\n",
      "robbery, perjury, forgery, coining false money, for committing rapes, or\n",
      "sodomy; for flying from their colours, or deserting to the enemy; and\n",
      "most of them had broken prison; none of these durst return to their\n",
      "native countries, for fear of being hanged, or of starving in a jail; and\n",
      "therefore they were under the necessity of seeking a livelihood in other\n",
      "places.”\n",
      "\n",
      "During this discourse, my master was pleased to interrupt me several\n",
      "times.  I had made use of many circumlocutions in describing to him the\n",
      "nature of the several crimes for which most of our crew had been forced\n",
      "to fly their country.  This labour took up several days’ conversation,\n",
      "before he was able to comprehend me.  He was wholly at a loss to know\n",
      "what could be the use or necessity of practising those vices.  To clear\n",
      "up which, I endeavoured to give some ideas of the desire of power and\n",
      "riches; of the terrible effects of lust, intemperance, malice, and envy.\n",
      "All this I was forced to define and describe by putting cases and making\n",
      "suppositions.  After which, like one whose imagination was struck with\n",
      "something never seen or heard of before, he would lift up his eyes with\n",
      "amazement and indignation.  Power, government, war, law, punishment, and\n",
      "a thousand other things, had no terms wherein that language could express\n",
      "them, which made the difficulty almost insuperable, to give my master any\n",
      "conception of what I meant.  But being of an excellent understanding,\n",
      "much improved by contemplation and converse, he at last arrived at a\n",
      "competent knowledge of what human nature, in our parts of the world, is\n",

      "corruption of ministers, who engage their master in a war, in order to\n",
      "stifle or divert the clamour of the subjects against their evil\n",
      "administration.  Difference in opinions has cost many millions of lives:\n",
      "for instance, whether flesh be bread, or bread be flesh; whether the\n",
      "juice of a certain berry be blood or wine; whether whistling be a vice or\n",
      "a virtue; whether it be better to kiss a post, or throw it into the fire;\n",
      "what is the best colour for a coat, whether black, white, red, or gray;\n",

      "“Sometimes the quarrel between two princes is to decide which of them\n",
      "shall dispossess a third of his dominions, where neither of them pretend\n",
      "to any right.  Sometimes one prince quarrels with another for fear the\n",
      "other should quarrel with him.  Sometimes a war is entered upon, because\n",
      "the enemy is too strong; and sometimes, because he is too weak.\n",
      "Sometimes our neighbours want the things which we have, or have the\n",
      "things which we want, and we both fight, till they take ours, or give us\n",
      "theirs.  It is a very justifiable cause of a war, to invade a country\n",
      "after the people have been wasted by famine, destroyed by pestilence, or\n",
      "embroiled by factions among themselves.  It is justifiable to enter into\n",
      "war against our nearest ally, when one of his towns lies convenient for\n",
      "us, or a territory of land, that would render our dominions round and\n",
      "complete.  If a prince sends forces into a nation, where the people are\n",
      "poor and ignorant, he may lawfully put half of them to death, and make\n",
      "slaves of the rest, in order to civilize and reduce them from their\n",
      "barbarous way of living.  It is a very kingly, honourable, and frequent\n",
      "practice, when one prince desires the assistance of another, to secure\n",
      "him against an invasion, that the assistant, when he has driven out the\n",
      "invader, should seize on the dominions himself, and kill, imprison, or\n",
      "banish, the prince he came to relieve.  Alliance by blood, or marriage,\n",
      "is a frequent cause of war between princes; and the nearer the kindred\n",
      "is, the greater their disposition to quarrel; poor nations are hungry,\n",
      "and rich nations are proud; and pride and hunger will ever be at\n",
      "variance.  For these reasons, the trade of a soldier is held the most\n",
      "honourable of all others; because a soldier is a _Yahoo_ hired to kill,\n",

      "before.  He thought his ears, being used to such abominable words, might,\n",
      "by degrees, admit them with less detestation: that although he hated the\n",
      "_Yahoos_ of this country, yet he no more blamed them for their odious\n",
      "qualities, than he did a _gnnayh_ (a bird of prey) for its cruelty, or a\n",
      "sharp stone for cutting his hoof.  But when a creature pretending to\n",

      "corruption of that faculty might be worse than brutality itself.  He\n",
      "seemed therefore confident, that, instead of reason we were only\n",
      "possessed of some quality fitted to increase our natural vices; as the\n",

      "body, not only larger but more distorted.”\n",

      "He added, “that he had heard too much upon the subject of war, both in\n",
      "this and some former discourses.  There was another point, which a little\n",
      "perplexed him at present.  I had informed him, that some of our crew left\n",
      "their country on account of being ruined by law; that I had already\n",
      "explained the meaning of the word; but he was at a loss how it should\n",
      "come to pass, that the law, which was intended for every man’s\n",
      "preservation, should be any man’s ruin.  Therefore he desired to be\n",
      "further satisfied what I meant by law, and the dispensers thereof,\n",
      "according to the present practice in my own country; because he thought\n",
      "nature and reason were sufficient guides for a reasonable animal, as we\n",
      "pretended to be, in showing us what he ought to do, and what to avoid.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I assured his honour, “that the law was a science in which I had not much\n",
      "conversed, further than by employing advocates, in vain, upon some\n",
      "injustices that had been done me: however, I would give him all the\n",
      "satisfaction I was able.”\n",

      "black, and black is white, according as they are paid.  To this society\n",
      "all the rest of the people are slaves.  For example, if my neighbour has\n",
      "a mind to my cow, he has a lawyer to prove that he ought to have my cow\n",
      "from me.  I must then hire another to defend my right, it being against\n",
      "all rules of law that any man should be allowed to speak for himself.\n",

      "in defending falsehood, is quite out of his element when he would be an\n",
      "advocate for justice, which is an unnatural office he always attempts\n",
      "with great awkwardness, if not with ill-will.  The second disadvantage\n",
      "is, that my lawyer must proceed with great caution, or else he will be\n",
      "reprimanded by the judges, and abhorred by his brethren, as one that\n",
      "would lessen the practice of the law.  And therefore I have but two\n",
      "methods to preserve my cow.  The first is, to gain over my adversary’s\n",
      "lawyer with a double fee, who will then betray his client by insinuating\n",
      "that he hath justice on his side.  The second way is for my lawyer to\n",
      "make my cause appear as unjust as he can, by allowing the cow to belong\n",
      "to my adversary: and this, if it be skilfully done, will certainly\n",
      "bespeak the favour of the bench.  Now your honour is to know, that these\n",
      "judges are persons appointed to decide all controversies of property, as\n",
      "well as for the trial of criminals, and picked out from the most\n",
      "dexterous lawyers, who are grown old or lazy; and having been biassed all\n",
      "their lives against truth and equity, lie under such a fatal necessity of\n",
      "favouring fraud, perjury, and oppression, that I have known some of them\n",
      "refuse a large bribe from the side where justice lay, rather than injure\n",
      "the faculty, by doing any thing unbecoming their nature or their office.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a maxim among these lawyers that whatever has been done before,\n",

      "all the decisions formerly made against common justice, and the general\n",
      "reason of mankind.  These, under the name of precedents, they produce as\n",

      "their laws are written, which they take special care to multiply; whereby\n",
      "they have wholly confounded the very essence of truth and falsehood, of\n",
      "right and wrong; so that it will take thirty years to decide, whether the\n",

      "the use of money, the materials it was made of, and the value of the\n",

      "avarice; that the rich man enjoyed the fruit of the poor man’s labour,\n",

      "supposition, that all animals had a title to their share in the\n",
      "productions of the earth, and especially those who presided over the\n",
      "rest.  Therefore he desired I would let him know, “what these costly\n",

      "enumerated as many sorts as came into my head, with the various methods\n",
      "of dressing them, which could not be done without sending vessels by sea\n",
      "to every part of the world, as well for liquors to drink as for sauces\n",
      "and innumerable other conveniences.  I assured him “that this whole globe\n",

      "confess, that the many virtues of those excellent quadrupeds, placed in\n",
      "opposite view to human corruptions, had so far opened my eyes and\n",
      "enlarged my understanding, that I began to view the actions and passions\n",
      "of man in a very different light, and to think the honour of my own kind\n",
      "not worth managing; which, besides, it was impossible for me to do,\n",
      "before a person of so acute a judgment as my master, who daily convinced\n",
      "me of a thousand faults in myself, whereof I had not the least perception\n",
      "before, and which, with us, would never be numbered even among human\n",
      "infirmities.  I had likewise learned, from his example, an utter\n",

      "Let me deal so candidly with the reader as to confess that there was yet\n",
      "a much stronger motive for the freedom I took in my representation of\n",
      "things.  I had not yet been a year in this country before I contracted\n",
      "such a love and veneration for the inhabitants, that I entered on a firm\n",
      "resolution never to return to humankind, but to pass the rest of my life\n",
      "among these admirable _Houyhnhnms_, in the contemplation and practice of\n",
      "every virtue, where I could have no example or incitement to vice.  But\n",
      "it was decreed by fortune, my perpetual enemy, that so great a felicity\n",
      "should not fall to my share.  However, it is now some comfort to reflect,\n",

      "favourable a turn as the matter would bear.  For, indeed, who is there\n",

      "fully satisfied, he sent for me one morning early, and commanded me to\n",
      "sit down at some distance (an honour which he had never before conferred\n",
      "upon me).  He said, “he had been very seriously considering my whole\n",

      "upon us as a sort of animals, to whose share, by what accident he could\n",
      "not conjecture, some small pittance of reason had fallen, whereof we made\n",
      "no other use, than by its assistance, to aggravate our natural\n",
      "corruptions, and to acquire new ones, which nature had not given us; that\n",
      "we disarmed ourselves of the few abilities she had bestowed; had been\n",
      "very successful in multiplying our original wants, and seemed to spend\n",
      "our whole lives in vain endeavours to supply them by our own inventions;\n",
      "that, as to myself, it was manifest I had neither the strength nor\n",
      "agility of a common _Yahoo_; that I walked infirmly on my hinder feet;\n",
      "had found out a contrivance to make my claws of no use or defence, and to\n",
      "remove the hair from my chin, which was intended as a shelter from the\n",
      "sun and the weather: lastly, that I could neither run with speed, nor\n",
      "climb trees like my brethren,” as he called them, “the _Yahoos_ in his\n",

      "“That our institutions of government and law were plainly owing to our\n",
      "gross defects in reason, and by consequence in virtue; because reason\n",
      "alone is sufficient to govern a rational creature; which was, therefore,\n",
      "a character we had no pretence to challenge, even from the account I had\n",
      "given of my own people; although he manifestly perceived, that, in order\n",
      "to favour them, I had concealed many particulars, and often said the\n",
      "thing which was not.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He was the more confirmed in this opinion, because, he observed, that as\n",
      "I agreed in every feature of my body with other _Yahoos_, except where it\n",
      "was to my real disadvantage in point of strength, speed, and activity,\n",
      "the shortness of my claws, and some other particulars where nature had no\n",
      "part; so from the representation I had given him of our lives, our\n",
      "manners, and our actions, he found as near a resemblance in the\n",
      "disposition of our minds.”  He said, “the _Yahoos_ were known to hate one\n",
      "another, more than they did any different species of animals; and the\n",
      "reason usually assigned was, the odiousness of their own shapes, which\n",
      "all could see in the rest, but not in themselves.  He had therefore begun\n",
      "to think it not unwise in us to cover our bodies, and by that invention\n",
      "conceal many of our deformities from each other, which would else be\n",
      "hardly supportable.  But he now found he had been mistaken, and that the\n",
      "dissensions of those brutes in his country were owing to the same cause\n",
      "with ours, as I had described them.  For if,” said he, “you throw among\n",
      "five _Yahoos_ as much food as would be sufficient for fifty, they will,\n",
      "instead of eating peaceably, fall together by the ears, each single one\n",
      "impatient to have all to itself; and therefore a servant was usually\n",
      "employed to stand by while they were feeding abroad, and those kept at\n",
      "home were tied at a distance from each other: that if a cow died of age\n",
      "or accident, before a _Houyhnhnm_ could secure it for his own _Yahoos_,\n",
      "those in the neighbourhood would come in herds to seize it, and then\n",
      "would ensue such a battle as I had described, with terrible wounds made\n",
      "by their claws on both sides, although they seldom were able to kill one\n",
      "another, for want of such convenient instruments of death as we had\n",
      "invented.  At other times, the like battles have been fought between the\n",
      "_Yahoos_ of several neighbourhoods, without any visible cause; those of\n",
      "one district watching all opportunities to surprise the next, before they\n",
      "are prepared.  But if they find their project has miscarried, they return\n",
      "home, and, for want of enemies, engage in what I call a civil war among\n",
      "themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That in some fields of his country there are certain shining stones of\n",
      "several colours, whereof the _Yahoos_ are violently fond: and when part\n",
      "of these stones is fixed in the earth, as it sometimes happens, they will\n",
      "dig with their claws for whole days to get them out; then carry them\n",
      "away, and hide them by heaps in their kennels; but still looking round\n",
      "with great caution, for fear their comrades should find out their\n",
      "treasure.”  My master said, “he could never discover the reason of this\n",
      "unnatural appetite, or how these stones could be of any use to a _Yahoo_;\n",
      "but now he believed it might proceed from the same principle of avarice\n",
      "which I had ascribed to mankind.  That he had once, by way of experiment,\n",
      "privately removed a heap of these stones from the place where one of his\n",
      "_Yahoos_ had buried it; whereupon the sordid animal, missing his\n",
      "treasure, by his loud lamenting brought the whole herd to the place,\n",
      "there miserably howled, then fell to biting and tearing the rest, began\n",
      "to pine away, would neither eat, nor sleep, nor work, till he ordered a\n",
      "servant privately to convey the stones into the same hole, and hide them\n",
      "as before; which, when his _Yahoo_ had found, he presently recovered his\n",
      "spirits and good humour, but took good care to remove them to a better\n",
      "hiding place, and has ever since been a very serviceable brute.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My master further assured me, which I also observed myself, “that in the\n",
      "fields where the shining stones abound, the fiercest and most frequent\n",
      "battles are fought, occasioned by perpetual inroads of the neighbouring\n",
      "_Yahoos_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He said, “it was common, when two _Yahoos_ discovered such a stone in a\n",
      "field, and were contending which of them should be the proprietor, a\n",
      "third would take the advantage, and carry it away from them both;” which\n",
      "my master would needs contend to have some kind of resemblance with our\n",
      "suits at law; wherein I thought it for our credit not to undeceive him;\n",
      "since the decision he mentioned was much more equitable than many decrees\n",
      "among us; because the plaintiff and defendant there lost nothing beside\n",
      "the stone they contended for: whereas our courts of equity would never\n",
      "have dismissed the cause, while either of them had any thing left.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master, continuing his discourse, said, “there was nothing that\n",
      "rendered the _Yahoos_ more odious, than their undistinguishing appetite\n",
      "to devour every thing that came in their way, whether herbs, roots,\n",
      "berries, the corrupted flesh of animals, or all mingled together: and it\n",
      "was peculiar in their temper, that they were fonder of what they could\n",
      "get by rapine or stealth, at a greater distance, than much better food\n",
      "provided for them at home.  If their prey held out, they would eat till\n",
      "they were ready to burst; after which, nature had pointed out to them a\n",
      "certain root that gave them a general evacuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There was also another kind of root, very juicy, but somewhat rare and\n",
      "difficult to be found, which the _Yahoos_ sought for with much eagerness,\n",
      "and would suck it with great delight; it produced in them the same\n",
      "effects that wine has upon us.  It would make them sometimes hug, and\n",
      "sometimes tear one another; they would howl, and grin, and chatter, and\n",
      "reel, and tumble, and then fall asleep in the mud.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I did indeed observe that the _Yahoos_ were the only animals in this\n",
      "country subject to any diseases; which, however, were much fewer than\n",
      "horses have among us, and contracted, not by any ill-treatment they meet\n",
      "with, but by the nastiness and greediness of that sordid brute.  Neither\n",
      "has their language any more than a general appellation for those\n",
      "maladies, which is borrowed from the name of the beast, and called\n",
      "_hnea-yahoo_, or _Yahoo’s evil_; and the cure prescribed is a mixture of\n",
      "their own dung and urine, forcibly put down the _Yahoo’s_ throat.  This I\n",
      "have since often known to have been taken with success, and do here\n",
      "freely recommend it to my countrymen for the public good, as an admirable\n",
      "specific against all diseases produced by repletion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As to learning, government, arts, manufactures, and the like,” my master\n",
      "confessed, “he could find little or no resemblance between the _Yahoos_\n",
      "of that country and those in ours; for he only meant to observe what\n",
      "parity there was in our natures.  He had heard, indeed, some curious\n",
      "_Houyhnhnms_ observe, that in most herds there was a sort of ruling\n",
      "_Yahoo_ (as among us there is generally some leading or principal stag in\n",
      "a park), who was always more deformed in body, and mischievous in\n",
      "disposition, than any of the rest; that this leader had usually a\n",
      "favourite as like himself as he could get, whose employment was to lick\n",
      "his master’s feet and posteriors, and drive the female _Yahoos_ to his\n",
      "kennel; for which he was now and then rewarded with a piece of ass’s\n",
      "flesh.  This favourite is hated by the whole herd, and therefore, to\n",
      "protect himself, keeps always near the person of his leader.  He usually\n",
      "continues in office till a worse can be found; but the very moment he is\n",
      "discarded, his successor, at the head of all the _Yahoos_ in that\n",
      "district, young and old, male and female, come in a body, and discharge\n",
      "their excrements upon him from head to foot.  But how far this might be\n",
      "applicable to our courts, and favourites, and ministers of state, my\n",
      "master said I could best determine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I durst make no return to this malicious insinuation, which debased human\n",
      "understanding below the sagacity of a common hound, who has judgment\n",
      "enough to distinguish and follow the cry of the ablest dog in the pack,\n",
      "without being ever mistaken.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master told me, “there were some qualities remarkable in the _Yahoos_,\n",
      "which he had not observed me to mention, or at least very slightly, in\n",
      "the accounts I had given of humankind.”  He said, “those animals, like\n",
      "other brutes, had their females in common; but in this they differed,\n",
      "that the she _Yahoo_ would admit the males while she was pregnant; and\n",
      "that the hes would quarrel and fight with the females, as fiercely as\n",
      "with each other; both which practices were such degrees of infamous\n",
      "brutality, as no other sensitive creature ever arrived at.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Another thing he wondered at in the _Yahoos_, was their strange\n",
      "disposition to nastiness and dirt; whereas there appears to be a natural\n",
      "love of cleanliness in all other animals.”  As to the two former\n",
      "accusations, I was glad to let them pass without any reply, because I had\n",
      "not a word to offer upon them in defence of my species, which otherwise I\n",
      "certainly had done from my own inclinations.  But I could have easily\n",
      "vindicated humankind from the imputation of singularity upon the last\n",
      "article, if there had been any swine in that country (as unluckily for me\n",
      "there were not), which, although it may be a sweeter quadruped than a\n",
      "_Yahoo_, cannot, I humbly conceive, in justice, pretend to more\n",
      "cleanliness; and so his honour himself must have owned, if he had seen\n",
      "their filthy way of feeding, and their custom of wallowing and sleeping\n",
      "in the mud.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master likewise mentioned another quality which his servants had\n",
      "discovered in several Yahoos, and to him was wholly unaccountable.  He\n",
      "said, “a fancy would sometimes take a _Yahoo_ to retire into a corner, to\n",
      "lie down, and howl, and groan, and spurn away all that came near him,\n",
      "although he were young and fat, wanted neither food nor water, nor did\n",
      "the servant imagine what could possibly ail him.  And the only remedy\n",
      "they found was, to set him to hard work, after which he would infallibly\n",
      "come to himself.”  To this I was silent out of partiality to my own kind;\n",
      "yet here I could plainly discover the true seeds of spleen, which only\n",
      "seizes on the lazy, the luxurious, and the rich; who, if they were forced\n",
      "to undergo the same regimen, I would undertake for the cure.\n",
      "\n",
      "His honour had further observed, “that a female _Yahoo_ would often stand\n",
      "behind a bank or a bush, to gaze on the young males passing by, and then\n",
      "appear, and hide, using many antic gestures and grimaces, at which time\n",
      "it was observed that she had a most offensive smell; and when any of the\n",
      "males advanced, would slowly retire, looking often back, and with a\n",
      "counterfeit show of fear, run off into some convenient place, where she\n",
      "knew the male would follow her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At other times, if a female stranger came among them, three or four of\n",
      "her own sex would get about her, and stare, and chatter, and grin, and\n",
      "smell her all over; and then turn off with gestures, that seemed to\n",
      "express contempt and disdain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps my master might refine a little in these speculations, which he\n",
      "had drawn from what he observed himself, or had been told him by others;\n",

      "A grand debate at the general assembly of the _Houyhnhnms_, and how it\n",
      "was determined.  The learning of the _Houyhnhnms_.  Their buildings.\n",
      "Their manner of burials.  The defectiveness of their language.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of these grand assemblies was held in my time, about three months\n",
      "before my departure, whither my master went as the representative of our\n",
      "district.  In this council was resumed their old debate, and indeed the\n",
      "only debate that ever happened in their country; whereof my master, after\n",
      "his return, give me a very particular account.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question to be debated was, “whether the _Yahoos_ should be\n",
      "exterminated from the face of the earth?”  One of the members for the\n",
      "affirmative offered several arguments of great strength and weight,\n",
      "alleging, “that as the _Yahoos_ were the most filthy, noisome, and\n",
      "deformed animals which nature ever produced, so they were the most\n",
      "restive and indocible, mischievous and malicious; they would privately\n",
      "suck the teats of the _Houyhnhnms’_ cows, kill and devour their cats,\n",
      "trample down their oats and grass, if they were not continually watched,\n",
      "and commit a thousand other extravagancies.”  He took notice of a general\n",
      "tradition, “that _Yahoos_ had not been always in their country; but that\n",
      "many ages ago, two of these brutes appeared together upon a mountain;\n",
      "whether produced by the heat of the sun upon corrupted mud and slime, or\n",
      "from the ooze and froth of the sea, was never known; that these _Yahoos_\n",
      "engendered, and their brood, in a short time, grew so numerous as to\n",
      "overrun and infest the whole nation; that the _Houyhnhnms_, to get rid of\n",
      "this evil, made a general hunting, and at last enclosed the whole herd;\n",
      "and destroying the elder, every _Houyhnhnm_ kept two young ones in a\n",
      "kennel, and brought them to such a degree of tameness, as an animal, so\n",
      "savage by nature, can be capable of acquiring, using them for draught and\n",
      "carriage; that there seemed to be much truth in this tradition, and that\n",
      "those creatures could not be _yinhniamshy_ (or _aborigines_ of the land),\n",
      "because of the violent hatred the _Houyhnhnms_, as well as all other\n",
      "animals, bore them, which, although their evil disposition sufficiently\n",
      "deserved, could never have arrived at so high a degree if they had been\n",
      "_aborigines_, or else they would have long since been rooted out; that\n",
      "the inhabitants, taking a fancy to use the service of the _Yahoos_, had,\n",
      "very imprudently, neglected to cultivate the breed of asses, which are a\n",
      "comely animal, easily kept, more tame and orderly, without any offensive\n",
      "smell, strong enough for labour, although they yield to the other in\n",
      "agility of body, and if their braying be no agreeable sound, it is far\n",
      "preferable to the horrible howlings of the _Yahoos_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Several others declared their sentiments to the same purpose, when my\n",
      "master proposed an expedient to the assembly, whereof he had indeed\n",
      "borrowed the hint from me.  “He approved of the tradition mentioned by\n",
      "the honourable member who spoke before, and affirmed, that the two\n",
      "_Yahoos_ said to be seen first among them, had been driven thither over\n",
      "the sea; that coming to land, and being forsaken by their companions,\n",
      "they retired to the mountains, and degenerating by degrees, became in\n",
      "process of time much more savage than those of their own species in the\n",
      "country whence these two originals came.  The reason of this assertion\n",
      "was, that he had now in his possession a certain wonderful _Yahoo_\n",
      "(meaning myself) which most of them had heard of, and many of them had\n",
      "seen.  He then related to them how he first found me; that my body was\n",
      "all covered with an artificial composure of the skins and hairs of other\n",
      "animals; that I spoke in a language of my own, and had thoroughly learned\n",
      "theirs; that I had related to him the accidents which brought me thither;\n",
      "that when he saw me without my covering, I was an exact _Yahoo_ in every\n",
      "part, only of a whiter colour, less hairy, and with shorter claws.  He\n",
      "added, how I had endeavoured to persuade him, that in my own and other\n",
      "countries, the _Yahoos_ acted as the governing, rational animal, and held\n",
      "the _Houyhnhnms_ in servitude; that he observed in me all the qualities\n",
      "of a _Yahoo_, only a little more civilized by some tincture of reason,\n",
      "which, however, was in a degree as far inferior to the _Houyhnhnm_ race,\n",
      "as the _Yahoos_ of their country were to me; that, among other things, I\n",
      "mentioned a custom we had of castrating _Houyhnhnms_ when they were\n",
      "young, in order to render them tame; that the operation was easy and\n",
      "safe; that it was no shame to learn wisdom from brutes, as industry is\n",
      "taught by the ant, and building by the swallow (for so I translate the\n",
      "word _lyhannh_, although it be a much larger fowl); that this invention\n",
      "might be practised upon the younger _Yahoos_ here, which besides\n",
      "rendering them tractable and fitter for use, would in an age put an end\n",
      "to the whole species, without destroying life; that in the mean time the\n",
      "_Houyhnhnms_ should be exhorted to cultivate the breed of asses, which,\n",
      "as they are in all respects more valuable brutes, so they have this\n",

      "unhappy effect, as the reader will know in its proper place, and whence I\n",
      "date all the succeeding misfortunes of my life.\n",

      "The _Houyhnhnms_ have no letters, and consequently their knowledge is all\n",

      "reason, and cut off from all commerce with other nations, the historical\n",
      "part is easily preserved without burdening their memories.  I have\n",
      "already observed that they are subject to no diseases, and therefore can\n",
      "have no need of physicians.  However, they have excellent medicines,\n",
      "composed of herbs, to cure accidental bruises and cuts in the pastern or\n",

      "friendship and benevolence or the praises of those who were victors in\n",
      "races and other bodily exercises.  Their buildings, although very rude\n",

      "very straight, and being pointed like stakes with a sharp stone (for the\n",

      "ground, about ten inches asunder, and then weave in oat straw, or\n",

      "a needle (which I lent her on purpose) with that joint.  They milk their\n",
      "cows, reap their oats, and do all the work which requires hands, in the\n",
      "same manner.  They have a kind of hard flints, which, by grinding against\n",
      "other stones, they form into instruments, that serve instead of wedges,\n",
      "axes, and hammers.  With tools made of these flints, they likewise cut\n",
      "their hay, and reap their oats, which there grow naturally in several\n",
      "fields; the _Yahoos_ draw home the sheaves in carriages, and the servants\n",
      "tread them in certain covered huts to get out the grain, which is kept in\n",

      "However, about ten days before their death, which they seldom fail in\n",
      "computing, they return the visits that have been made them by those who\n",

      "I had settled my little economy to my own heart’s content.  My master had\n",
      "ordered a room to be made for me, after their manner, about six yards\n",
      "from the house: the sides and floors of which I plastered with clay, and\n",
      "covered with rush-mats of my own contriving.  I had beaten hemp, which\n",
      "there grows wild, and made of it a sort of ticking; this I filled with\n",
      "the feathers of several birds I had taken with springes made of _Yahoos’_\n",
      "hairs, and were excellent food.  I had worked two chairs with my knife,\n",
      "the sorrel nag helping me in the grosser and more laborious part.  When\n",
      "my clothes were worn to rags, I made myself others with the skins of\n",
      "rabbits, and of a certain beautiful animal, about the same size, called\n",
      "_nnuhnoh_, the skin of which is covered with a fine down.  Of these I\n",
      "also made very tolerable stockings.  I soled my shoes with wood, which I\n",
      "cut from a tree, and fitted to the upper-leather; and when this was worn\n",
      "out, I supplied it with the skins of _Yahoos_ dried in the sun.  I often\n",
      "got honey out of hollow trees, which I mingled with water, or ate with my\n",
      "bread.  No man could more verify the truth of these two maxims, “That\n",
      "nature is very easily satisfied;” and, “That necessity is the mother of\n",

      "limits of virtue; upon the unerring rules of reason, or upon some\n",
      "determinations to be taken at the next great assembly: and often upon the\n",
      "various excellences of poetry.  I may add, without vanity, that my\n",

      "supposing what qualities a _Yahoo_ of their country, with a small\n",

      "admired the strength, comeliness, and speed of the inhabitants; and such\n",
      "a constellation of virtues, in such amiable persons, produced in me the\n",
      "highest veneration.  At first, indeed, I did not feel that natural awe,\n",
      "which the _Yahoos_ and all other animals bear toward them; but it grew\n",
      "upon me by decrees, much sooner than I imagined, and was mingled with a\n",
      "respectful love and gratitude, that they would condescend to distinguish\n",
      "me from the rest of my species.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I thought of my family, my friends, my countrymen, or the human race\n",

      "disposition, perhaps a little more civilized, and qualified with the gift\n",
      "of speech; but making no other use of reason, than to improve and\n",
      "multiply those vices whereof their brethren in this country had only the\n",
      "share that nature allotted them.  When I happened to behold the\n",
      "reflection of my own form in a lake or fountain, I turned away my face in\n",
      "horror and detestation of myself, and could better endure the sight of a\n",
      "common _Yahoo_ than of my own person.  By conversing with the\n",
      "_Houyhnhnms_, and looking upon them with delight, I fell to imitate their\n",
      "gait and gesture, which is now grown into a habit; and my friends often\n",
      "tell me, in a blunt way, “that I trot like a horse;” which, however, I\n",
      "take for a great compliment.  Neither shall I disown, that in speaking I\n",

      "In the midst of all this happiness, and when I looked upon myself to be\n",
      "fully settled for life, my master sent for me one morning a little\n",
      "earlier than his usual hour.  I observed by his countenance that he was\n",
      "in some perplexity, and at a loss how to begin what he had to speak.\n",
      "After a short silence, he told me, “he did not know how I would take what\n",
      "he was going to say: that in the last general assembly, when the affair\n",
      "of the _Yahoos_ was entered upon, the representatives had taken offence\n",
      "at his keeping a _Yahoo_ (meaning myself) in his family, more like a\n",
      "_Houyhnhnm_ than a brute animal; that he was known frequently to converse\n",
      "with me, as if he could receive some advantage or pleasure in my company;\n",
      "that such a practice was not agreeable to reason or nature, or a thing\n",
      "ever heard of before among them; the assembly did therefore exhort him\n",
      "either to employ me like the rest of my species, or command me to swim\n",
      "back to the place whence I came: that the first of these expedients was\n",
      "utterly rejected by all the _Houyhnhnms_ who had ever seen me at his\n",
      "house or their own; for they alleged, that because I had some rudiments\n",
      "of reason, added to the natural pravity of those animals, it was to be\n",
      "feared I might be able to seduce them into the woody and mountainous\n",
      "parts of the country, and bring them in troops by night to destroy the\n",
      "_Houyhnhnms’_ cattle, as being naturally of the ravenous kind, and averse\n",
      "from labour.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My master added, “that he was daily pressed by the _Houyhnhnms_ of the\n",
      "neighbourhood to have the assembly’s exhortation executed, which he could\n",
      "not put off much longer.  He doubted it would be impossible for me to\n",
      "swim to another country; and therefore wished I would contrive some sort\n",
      "of vehicle, resembling those I had described to him, that might carry me\n",
      "on the sea; in which work I should have the assistance of his own\n",
      "servants, as well as those of his neighbours.”  He concluded, “that for\n",
      "his own part, he could have been content to keep me in his service as\n",
      "long as I lived; because he found I had cured myself of some bad habits\n",
      "and dispositions, by endeavouring, as far as my inferior nature was\n",
      "capable, to imitate the _Houyhnhnms_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I should here observe to the reader, that a decree of the general\n",
      "assembly in this country is expressed by the word _hnhloayn_, which\n",
      "signifies an exhortation, as near as I can render it; for they have no\n",
      "conception how a rational creature can be compelled, but only advised, or\n",
      "exhorted; because no person can disobey reason, without giving up his\n",
      "claim to be a rational creature.\n",

      "at his feet.  When I came to myself, he told me “that he concluded I had\n",
      "been dead;” for these people are subject to no such imbecilities of\n",
      "nature.  I answered in a faint voice, “that death would have been too\n",
      "great a happiness; that although I could not blame the assembly’s\n",
      "exhortation, or the urgency of his friends; yet, in my weak and corrupt\n",
      "judgment, I thought it might consist with reason to have been less\n",
      "rigorous; that I could not swim a league, and probably the nearest land\n",
      "to theirs might be distant above a hundred: that many materials,\n",
      "necessary for making a small vessel to carry me off, were wholly wanting\n",
      "in this country; which, however, I would attempt, in obedience and\n",
      "gratitude to his honour, although I concluded the thing to be impossible,\n",
      "and therefore looked on myself as already devoted to destruction; that\n",
      "the certain prospect of an unnatural death was the least of my evils;\n",
      "for, supposing I should escape with life by some strange adventure, how\n",
      "could I think with temper of passing my days among _Yahoos_, and\n",

      "assistance in making a vessel, and desiring a reasonable time for so\n",
      "difficult a work, I told him I would endeavour to preserve a wretched\n",

      "My master, in a few words, made me a very gracious reply; allowed me the\n",
      "space of two months to finish my boat; and ordered the sorrel nag, my\n",
      "fellow-servant (for so, at this distance, I may presume to call him), to\n",

      "fastened very artificially after their manner, to a wooden handle, cut\n",
      "down several oak wattles, about the thickness of a walking-staff, and\n",
      "some larger pieces.  But I shall not trouble the reader with a particular\n",
      "description of my own mechanics; let it suffice to say, that in six weeks\n",
      "time with the help of the sorrel nag, who performed the parts that\n",
      "required most labour, I finished a sort of Indian canoe, but much larger,\n",
      "covering it with the skins of _Yahoos_, well stitched together with\n",
      "hempen threads of my own making.  My sail was likewise composed of the\n",
      "skins of the same animal; but I made use of the youngest I could get, the\n",
      "older being too tough and thick; and I likewise provided myself with four\n",
      "paddles.  I laid in a stock of boiled flesh, of rabbits and fowls, and\n",
      "took with me two vessels, one filled with milk and the other with water.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried my canoe in a large pond, near my master’s house, and then\n",
      "corrected in it what was amiss; stopping all the chinks with _Yahoos’_\n",
      "tallow, till I found it staunch, and able to bear me and my freight; and,\n",

      "and by six in the evening I computed I had gone eastward at least\n",
      "eighteen leagues; when I spied a very small island about half a league\n",
      "off, which I soon reached.  It was nothing but a rock, with one creek\n",
      "naturally arched by the force of tempests.  Here I put in my canoe, and\n",
      "climbing a part of the rock, I could plainly discover land to the east,\n",
      "extending from south to north.  I lay all night in my canoe; and\n",
      "repeating my voyage early in the morning, I arrived in seven hours to the\n",
      "south-east point of New Holland.  This confirmed me in the opinion I have\n",
      "long entertained, that the maps and charts place this country at least\n",
      "three degrees more to the east than it really is; which thought I\n",
      "communicated many years ago to my worthy friend, Mr. Herman Moll, and\n",
      "gave him my reasons for it, although he has rather chosen to follow other\n",
      "authors.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw no inhabitants in the place where I landed, and being unarmed, I\n",
      "was afraid of venturing far into the country.  I found some shellfish on\n",
      "the shore, and ate them raw, not daring to kindle a fire, for fear of\n",
      "being discovered by the natives.  I continued three days feeding on\n",
      "oysters and limpets, to save my own provisions; and I fortunately found a\n",
      "brook of excellent water, which gave me great relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the fourth day, venturing out early a little too far, I saw twenty or\n",
      "thirty natives upon a height not above five hundred yards from me.  They\n",
      "were stark naked, men, women, and children, round a fire, as I could\n",
      "discover by the smoke.  One of them spied me, and gave notice to the\n",
      "rest; five of them advanced toward me, leaving the women and children at\n",
      "the fire.  I made what haste I could to the shore, and, getting into my\n",
      "canoe, shoved off: the savages, observing me retreat, ran after me: and\n",
      "before I could get far enough into the sea, discharged an arrow which\n",
      "wounded me deeply on the inside of my left knee: I shall carry the mark\n",
      "to my grave.  I apprehended the arrow might be poisoned, and paddling out\n",
      "of the reach of their darts (being a calm day), I made a shift to suck\n",
      "the wound, and dress it as well as I could.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was at a loss what to do, for I durst not return to the same\n",
      "landing-place, but stood to the north, and was forced to paddle, for the\n",
      "wind, though very gentle, was against me, blowing north-west.  As I was\n",
      "looking about for a secure landing-place, I saw a sail to the\n",
      "north-north-east, which appearing every minute more visible, I was in\n",
      "some doubt whether I should wait for them or not; but at last my\n",
      "detestation of the _Yahoo_ race prevailed: and turning my canoe, I sailed\n",
      "and paddled together to the south, and got into the same creek whence I\n",
      "set out in the morning, choosing rather to trust myself among these\n",
      "barbarians, than live with European _Yahoos_.  I drew up my canoe as\n",
      "close as I could to the shore, and hid myself behind a stone by the\n",
      "little brook, which, as I have already said, was excellent water.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ship came within half a league of this creek, and sent her long boat\n",
      "with vessels to take in fresh water (for the place, it seems, was very\n",
      "well known); but I did not observe it, till the boat was almost on shore;\n",
      "and it was too late to seek another hiding-place.  The seamen at their\n",
      "landing observed my canoe, and rummaging it all over, easily conjectured\n",
      "that the owner could not be far off.  Four of them, well armed, searched\n",
      "every cranny and lurking-hole, till at last they found me flat on my face\n",
      "behind the stone.  They gazed awhile in admiration at my strange uncouth\n",
      "dress; my coat made of skins, my wooden-soled shoes, and my furred\n",
      "stockings; whence, however, they concluded, I was not a native of the\n",
      "place, who all go naked.  One of the seamen, in Portuguese, bid me rise,\n",
      "and asked who I was.  I understood that language very well, and getting\n",
      "upon my feet, said, “I was a poor _Yahoo_ banished from the _Houyhnhnms_,\n",
      "and desired they would please to let me depart.”  They admired to hear me\n",
      "answer them in their own tongue, and saw by my complexion I must be a\n",
      "European; but were at a loss to know what I meant by _Yahoos_ and\n",
      "_Houyhnhnms_; and at the same time fell a-laughing at my strange tone in\n",
      "speaking, which resembled the neighing of a horse.  I trembled all the\n",
      "while betwixt fear and hatred.  I again desired leave to depart, and was\n",
      "gently moving to my canoe; but they laid hold of me, desiring to know,\n",
      "“what country I was of? whence I came?” with many other questions.  I\n",
      "told them “I was born in England, whence I came about five years ago, and\n",
      "then their country and ours were at peace.  I therefore hoped they would\n",
      "not treat me as an enemy, since I meant them no harm, but was a poor\n",
      "_Yahoo_ seeking some desolate place where to pass the remainder of his\n",
      "unfortunate life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When they began to talk, I thought I never heard or saw any thing more\n",
      "unnatural; for it appeared to me as monstrous as if a dog or a cow should\n",
      "speak in England, or a _Yahoo_ in _Houyhnhnmland_.  The honest Portuguese\n",
      "were equally amazed at my strange dress, and the odd manner of delivering\n",
      "my words, which, however, they understood very well.  They spoke to me\n",
      "with great humanity, and said, “they were sure the captain would carry me\n",
      "_gratis_ to Lisbon, whence I might return to my own country; that two of\n",
      "the seamen would go back to the ship, inform the captain of what they had\n",
      "seen, and receive his orders; in the mean time, unless I would give my\n",
      "solemn oath not to fly, they would secure me by force.  I thought it best\n",
      "to comply with their proposal.  They were very curious to know my story,\n",
      "but I gave them very little satisfaction, and they all conjectured that\n",
      "my misfortunes had impaired my reason.  In two hours the boat, which went\n",
      "laden with vessels of water, returned, with the captain’s command to\n",
      "fetch me on board.  I fell on my knees to preserve my liberty; but all\n",
      "was in vain; and the men, having tied me with cords, heaved me into the\n",
      "boat, whence I was taken into the ship, and thence into the captain’s\n",
      "cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "His name was Pedro de Mendez; he was a very courteous and generous\n",
      "person.  He entreated me to give some account of myself, and desired to\n",
      "know what I would eat or drink; said, “I should be used as well as\n",
      "himself;” and spoke so many obliging things, that I wondered to find such\n",
      "civilities from a _Yahoo_.  However, I remained silent and sullen; I was\n",
      "ready to faint at the very smell of him and his men.  At last I desired\n",
      "something to eat out of my own canoe; but he ordered me a chicken, and\n",
      "some excellent wine, and then directed that I should be put to bed in a\n",
      "very clean cabin.  I would not undress myself, but lay on the\n",
      "bed-clothes, and in half an hour stole out, when I thought the crew was\n",
      "at dinner, and getting to the side of the ship, was going to leap into\n",
      "the sea, and swim for my life, rather than continue among _Yahoos_.  But\n",
      "one of the seamen prevented me, and having informed the captain, I was\n",
      "chained to my cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "After dinner, Don Pedro came to me, and desired to know my reason for so\n",
      "desperate an attempt; assured me, “he only meant to do me all the service\n",
      "he was able;” and spoke so very movingly, that at last I descended to\n",
      "treat him like an animal which had some little portion of reason.  I gave\n",
      "him a very short relation of my voyage; of the conspiracy against me by\n",
      "my own men; of the country where they set me on shore, and of my five\n",
      "years residence there.  All which he looked upon as if it were a dream or\n",
      "a vision; whereat I took great offence; for I had quite forgot the\n",
      "faculty of lying, so peculiar to _Yahoos_, in all countries where they\n",
      "preside, and, consequently, their disposition of suspecting truth in\n",
      "others of their own species.  I asked him, “whether it were the custom in\n",
      "his country to say the thing which was not?”  I assured him, “I had\n",
      "almost forgot what he meant by falsehood, and if I had lived a thousand\n",
      "years in _Houyhnhnmland_, I should never have heard a lie from the\n",
      "meanest servant; that I was altogether indifferent whether he believed me\n",
      "or not; but, however, in return for his favours, I would give so much\n",
      "allowance to the corruption of his nature, as to answer any objection he\n",
      "would please to make, and then he might easily discover the truth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The captain, a wise man, after many endeavours to catch me tripping in\n",
      "some part of my story, at last began to have a better opinion of my\n",
      "veracity.  But he added, “that since I professed so inviolable an\n",
      "attachment to truth, I must give him my word and honour to bear him\n",
      "company in this voyage, without attempting any thing against my life; or\n",
      "else he would continue me a prisoner till we arrived at Lisbon.”  I gave\n",
      "him the promise he required; but at the same time protested, “that I\n",
      "would suffer the greatest hardships, rather than return to live among\n",
      "_Yahoos_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Our voyage passed without any considerable accident.  In gratitude to the\n",
      "captain, I sometimes sat with him, at his earnest request, and strove to\n",
      "conceal my antipathy against human kind, although it often broke out;\n",
      "which he suffered to pass without observation.  But the greatest part of\n",
      "the day I confined myself to my cabin, to avoid seeing any of the crew.\n",
      "The captain had often entreated me to strip myself of my savage dress,\n",
      "and offered to lend me the best suit of clothes he had.  This I would not\n",
      "be prevailed on to accept, abhorring to cover myself with any thing that\n",
      "had been on the back of a _Yahoo_.  I only desired he would lend me two\n",
      "clean shirts, which, having been washed since he wore them, I believed\n",
      "would not so much defile me.  These I changed every second day, and\n",
      "washed them myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "We arrived at Lisbon, Nov. 5, 1715.  At our landing, the captain forced\n",
      "me to cover myself with his cloak, to prevent the rabble from crowding\n",
      "about me.  I was conveyed to his own house; and at my earnest request he\n",
      "led me up to the highest room backwards.  I conjured him “to conceal from\n",
      "all persons what I had told him of the _Houyhnhnms_; because the least\n",
      "hint of such a story would not only draw numbers of people to see me, but\n",
      "probably put me in danger of being imprisoned, or burnt by the\n",
      "Inquisition.”  The captain persuaded me to accept a suit of clothes newly\n",
      "made; but I would not suffer the tailor to take my measure; however, Don\n",
      "Pedro being almost of my size, they fitted me well enough.  He accoutred\n",
      "me with other necessaries, all new, which I aired for twenty-four hours\n",
      "before I would use them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The captain had no wife, nor above three servants, none of which were\n",
      "suffered to attend at meals; and his whole deportment was so obliging,\n",
      "added to very good human understanding, that I really began to tolerate\n",
      "his company.  He gained so far upon me, that I ventured to look out of\n",
      "the back window.  By degrees I was brought into another room, whence I\n",
      "peeped into the street, but drew my head back in a fright.  In a week’s\n",
      "time he seduced me down to the door.  I found my terror gradually\n",
      "lessened, but my hatred and contempt seemed to increase.  I was at last\n",
      "bold enough to walk the street in his company, but kept my nose well\n",
      "stopped with rue, or sometimes with tobacco.\n",
      "\n",
      "In ten days, Don Pedro, to whom I had given some account of my domestic\n",
      "affairs, put it upon me, as a matter of honour and conscience, “that I\n",
      "ought to return to my native country, and live at home with my wife and\n",
      "children.”  He told me, “there was an English ship in the port just ready\n",
      "to sail, and he would furnish me with all things necessary.”  It would be\n",
      "tedious to repeat his arguments, and my contradictions.  He said, “it was\n",
      "altogether impossible to find such a solitary island as I desired to live\n",
      "in; but I might command in my own house, and pass my time in a manner as\n",
      "recluse as I pleased.”\n",

      "24th day of November, in an English merchantman, but who was the master I\n",
      "never inquired.  Don Pedro accompanied me to the ship, and lent me twenty\n",
      "pounds.  He took kind leave of me, and embraced me at parting, which I\n",
      "bore as well as I could.  During this last voyage I had no commerce with\n",
      "the master or any of his men; but, pretending I was sick, kept close in\n",
      "my cabin.  On the fifth of December, 1715, we cast anchor in the Downs,\n",

      "filled me only with hatred, disgust, and contempt; and the more, by\n",
      "reflecting on the near alliance I had to them.  For although, since my\n",
      "unfortunate exile from the _Houyhnhnm_ country, I had compelled myself to\n",
      "tolerate the sight of _Yahoos_, and to converse with Don Pedro de Mendez,\n",

      "\n",
      "As soon as I entered the house, my wife took me in her arms, and kissed\n",
      "me; at which, having not been used to the touch of that odious animal for\n",
      "so many years, I fell into a swoon for almost an hour.  At the time I am\n",
      "writing, it is five years since my last return to England.  During the\n",
      "first year, I could not endure my wife or children in my presence; the\n",

      "in the same room.  To this hour they dare not presume to touch my bread,\n",
      "or drink out of the same cup, neither was I ever able to let one of them\n",
      "take me by the hand.  The first money I laid out was to buy two young\n",

      "\n",
      "The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient and\n",
      "intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us on the\n",
      "mother’s side.  About three years ago, Mr. Gulliver growing weary of the\n",
      "concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff, made a\n",
      "small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark, in\n",
      "Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet in\n",
      "good esteem among his neighbours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his father\n",
      "dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from Oxfordshire; to\n",
      "confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at Banbury in that\n",
      "county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following papers in\n",
      "my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should think fit.  I\n",
      "have carefully perused them three times.  The style is very plain and\n",
      "simple; and the only fault I find is, that the author, after the manner\n",
      "of travellers, is a little too circumstantial.  There is an air of truth\n",
      "apparent through the whole; and indeed the author was so distinguished\n",
      "for his veracity, that it became a sort of proverb among his neighbours\n",
      "at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing, to say, it was as true as if\n",
      "Mr. Gulliver had spoken it.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the author’s\n",
      "permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to send them into\n",
      "the world, hoping they may be, at least for some time, a better\n",
      "entertainment to our young noblemen, than the common scribbles of\n",
      "politics and party.\n",
      "\n",
      "This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not made\n",
      "bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and tides,\n",
      "as well as to the variations and bearings in the several voyages,\n",
      "together with the minute descriptions of the management of the ship in\n",
      "storms, in the style of sailors; likewise the account of longitudes and\n",
      "latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend, that Mr. Gulliver may be a\n",
      "little dissatisfied.  But I was resolved to fit the work as much as\n",
      "possible to the general capacity of readers.  However, if my own\n",
      "ignorance in sea affairs shall have led me to commit some mistakes, I\n",
      "alone am answerable for them.  And if any traveller hath a curiosity to\n",

      "I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be called to\n",
      "it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on me to\n",
      "publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels, with directions\n",
      "to hire some young gentleman of either university to put them in order,\n",
      "and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did, by my advice, in his\n",

      "power to consent that any thing should be omitted, and much less that any\n",
      "thing should be inserted; therefore, as to the latter, I do here renounce\n",
      "every thing of that kind; particularly a paragraph about her majesty\n",
      "Queen Anne, of most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence\n",
      "and esteem her more than any of human species.  But you, or your\n",
      "interpolator, ought to have considered, that it was not my inclination,\n",
      "so was it not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my\n",
      "master _Houyhnhnm_: And besides, the fact was altogether false; for to my\n",
      "knowledge, being in England during some part of her majesty’s reign, she\n",
      "did govern by a chief minister; nay even by two successively, the first\n",
      "whereof was the lord of Godolphin, and the second the lord of Oxford; so\n",
      "that you have made me say the thing that was not.  Likewise in the\n",
      "account of the academy of projectors, and several passages of my\n",
      "discourse to my master _Houyhnhnm_, you have either omitted some material\n",
      "circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner, that I do\n",
      "hardly know my own work.  When I formerly hinted to you something of this\n",
      "in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you were afraid of giving\n",
      "offence; that people in power were very watchful over the press, and apt\n",
      "not only to interpret, but to punish every thing which looked like an\n",
      "_innuendo_ (as I think you call it).  But, pray how could that which I\n",
      "spoke so many years ago, and at about five thousand leagues distance, in\n",
      "another reign, be applied to any of the _Yahoos_, who now are said to\n",
      "govern the herd; especially at a time when I little thought, or feared,\n",
      "the unhappiness of living under them?  Have not I the most reason to\n",
      "complain, when I see these very _Yahoos_ carried by _Houyhnhnms_ in a\n",
      "vehicle, as if they were brutes, and those the rational creatures?  And\n",
      "indeed to avoid so monstrous and detestable a sight was one principal\n",
      "motive of my retirement hither.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself, and to\n",
      "the trust I reposed in you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do, in the next place, complain of my own great want of judgment, in\n",
      "being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasoning of you and\n",
      "some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my travels to be\n",
      "published.  Pray bring to your mind how often I desired you to consider,\n",
      "when you insisted on the motive of public good, that the _Yahoos_ were a\n",
      "species of animals utterly incapable of amendment by precept or example:\n",
      "and so it has proved; for, instead of seeing a full stop put to all\n",
      "abuses and corruptions, at least in this little island, as I had reason\n",
      "to expect; behold, after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my\n",
      "book has produced one single effect according to my intentions.  I\n",
      "desired you would let me know, by a letter, when party and faction were\n",
      "extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and modest,\n",
      "with some tincture of common sense, and Smithfield blazing with pyramids\n",
      "of law books; the young nobility’s education entirely changed; the\n",
      "physicians banished; the female _Yahoos_ abounding in virtue, honour,\n",
      "truth, and good sense; courts and levees of great ministers thoroughly\n",
      "weeded and swept; wit, merit, and learning rewarded; all disgracers of\n",
      "the press in prose and verse condemned to eat nothing but their own\n",
      "cotton, and quench their thirst with their own ink.  These, and a\n",
      "thousand other reformations, I firmly counted upon by your encouragement;\n",
      "as indeed they were plainly deducible from the precepts delivered in my\n",
      "book.  And it must be owned, that seven months were a sufficient time to\n",
      "correct every vice and folly to which _Yahoos_ are subject, if their\n",
      "natures had been capable of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom.\n",
      "Yet, so far have you been from answering my expectation in any of your\n",
      "letters; that on the contrary you are loading our carrier every week with\n",
      "libels, and keys, and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein\n",
      "I see myself accused of reflecting upon great state folk; of degrading\n",
      "human nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of\n",
      "abusing the female sex.  I find likewise that the writers of those\n",
      "bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not allow\n",
      "me to be the author of my own travels; and others make me author of books\n",
      "to which I am wholly a stranger.\n",
      "\n",
      "I find likewise that your printer has been so careless as to confound the\n",
      "times, and mistake the dates, of my several voyages and returns; neither\n",
      "assigning the true year, nor the true month, nor day of the month: and I\n",

      "corrections, which you may insert, if ever there should be a second\n",

      "my judicious and candid readers to adjust it as they please.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hear some of our sea _Yahoos_ find fault with my sea-language, as not\n",
      "proper in many parts, nor now in use.  I cannot help it.  In my first\n",
      "voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest mariners, and\n",
      "learned to speak as they did.  But I have since found that the sea\n",
      "_Yahoos_ are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled in their\n",
      "words, which the latter change every year; insomuch, as I remember upon\n",
      "each return to my own country their old dialect was so altered, that I\n",
      "could hardly understand the new.  And I observe, when any _Yahoo_ comes\n",
      "from London out of curiosity to visit me at my house, we neither of us\n",
      "are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner intelligible to the\n",
      "other.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the censure of the _Yahoos_ could any way affect me, I should have\n",
      "great reason to complain, that some of them are so bold as to think my\n",
      "book of travels a mere fiction out of mine own brain, and have gone so\n",
      "far as to drop hints, that the _Houyhnhnms_ and _Yahoos_ have no more\n",
      "existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of _Lilliput_, _Brobdingrag_\n",
      "(for so the word should have been spelt, and not erroneously\n",
      "_Brobdingnag_), and _Laputa_, I have never yet heard of any _Yahoo_ so\n",
      "presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have related\n",
      "concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every reader with\n",
      "conviction.  And is there less probability in my account of the\n",
      "_Houyhnhnms_ or _Yahoos_, when it is manifest as to the latter, there are\n",
      "so many thousands even in this country, who only differ from their\n",
      "brother brutes in _Houyhnhnmland_, because they use a sort of jabber, and\n",
      "do not go naked?  I wrote for their amendment, and not their approbation.\n",
      "The united praise of the whole race would be of less consequence to me,\n",
      "than the neighing of those two degenerate _Houyhnhnms_ I keep in my\n",
      "stable; because from these, degenerate as they are, I still improve in\n",
      "some virtues without any mixture of vice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do these miserable animals presume to think, that I am so degenerated as\n",
      "to defend my veracity?  _Yahoo_ as I am, it is well known through all\n",
      "_Houyhnhnmland_, that, by the instructions and example of my illustrious\n",
      "master, I was able in the compass of two years (although I confess with\n",
      "the utmost difficulty) to remove that infernal habit of lying, shuffling,\n",
      "deceiving, and equivocating, so deeply rooted in the very souls of all my\n",
      "species; especially the Europeans.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but I\n",

      "My father had a small estate in Nottinghamshire: I was the third of five\n",
      "sons.  He sent me to Emanuel College in Cambridge at fourteen years old,\n",
      "where I resided three years, and applied myself close to my studies; but\n",

      "being too great for a narrow fortune, I was bound apprentice to Mr. James\n",
      "Bates, an eminent surgeon in London, with whom I continued four years.\n",

      "father: where, by the assistance of him and my uncle John, and some other\n",
      "relations, I got forty pounds, and a promise of thirty pounds a year to\n",
      "maintain me at Leyden: there I studied physic two years and seven months,\n",
      "knowing it would be useful in long voyages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after my return from Leyden, I was recommended by my good master,\n",
      "Mr. Bates, to be surgeon to the Swallow, Captain Abraham Pannel,\n",
      "commander; with whom I continued three years and a half, making a voyage\n",
      "or two into the Levant, and some other parts.  When I came back I\n",
      "resolved to settle in London; to which Mr. Bates, my master, encouraged\n",
      "me, and by him I was recommended to several patients.  I took part of a\n",
      "small house in the Old Jewry; and being advised to alter my condition, I\n",
      "married Mrs. Mary Burton, second daughter to Mr. Edmund Burton, hosier,\n",
      "in Newgate-street, with whom I received four hundred pounds for a\n",
      "portion.\n",
      "\n",
      "But my good master Bates dying in two years after, and I having few\n",
      "friends, my business began to fail; for my conscience would not suffer me\n",
      "to imitate the bad practice of too many among my brethren.  Having\n",
      "therefore consulted with my wife, and some of my acquaintance, I\n",
      "determined to go again to sea.  I was surgeon successively in two ships,\n",
      "and made several voyages, for six years, to the East and West Indies, by\n",
      "which I got some addition to my fortune.  My hours of leisure I spent in\n",
      "reading the best authors, ancient and modern, being always provided with\n",
      "a good number of books; and when I was ashore, in observing the manners\n",
      "and dispositions of the people, as well as learning their language;\n",
      "wherein I had a great facility, by the strength of my memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last of these voyages not proving very fortunate, I grew weary of the\n",
      "sea, and intended to stay at home with my wife and family.  I removed\n",
      "from the Old Jewry to Fetter Lane, and from thence to Wapping, hoping to\n",
      "get business among the sailors; but it would not turn to account.  After\n",
      "three years expectation that things would mend, I accepted an\n",
      "advantageous offer from Captain William Prichard, master of the Antelope,\n",
      "who was making a voyage to the South Sea.  We set sail from Bristol, May\n",
      "4, 1699, and our voyage was at first very prosperous.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would not be proper, for some reasons, to trouble the reader with the\n",
      "particulars of our adventures in those seas; let it suffice to inform\n",
      "him, that in our passage from thence to the East Indies, we were driven\n",
      "by a violent storm to the north-west of Van Diemen’s Land.  By an\n",
      "observation, we found ourselves in the latitude of 30 degrees 2 minutes\n",
      "south.  Twelve of our crew were dead by immoderate labour and ill food;\n",
      "the rest were in a very weak condition.  On the 5th of November, which\n",
      "was the beginning of summer in those parts, the weather being very hazy,\n",
      "the seamen spied a rock within half a cable’s length of the ship; but the\n",
      "wind was so strong, that we were driven directly upon it, and immediately\n",
      "split.  Six of the crew, of whom I was one, having let down the boat into\n",
      "the sea, made a shift to get clear of the ship and the rock.  We rowed,\n",
      "by my computation, about three leagues, till we were able to work no\n",
      "longer, being already spent with labour while we were in the ship.  We\n",
      "therefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves, and in about half\n",
      "an hour the boat was overset by a sudden flurry from the north.  What\n",
      "became of my companions in the boat, as well as of those who escaped on\n",
      "the rock, or were left in the vessel, I cannot tell; but conclude they\n",
      "were all lost.  For my own part, I swam as fortune directed me, and was\n",
      "pushed forward by wind and tide.  I often let my legs drop, and could\n",
      "feel no bottom; but when I was almost gone, and able to struggle no\n",
      "longer, I found myself within my depth; and by this time the storm was\n",
      "much abated.  The declivity was so small, that I walked near a mile\n",
      "before I got to the shore, which I conjectured was about eight o’clock in\n",
      "the evening.  I then advanced forward near half a mile, but could not\n",
      "discover any sign of houses or inhabitants; at least I was in so weak a\n",
      "condition, that I did not observe them.  I was extremely tired, and with\n",
      "that, and the heat of the weather, and about half a pint of brandy that I\n",
      "drank as I left the ship, I found myself much inclined to sleep.  I lay\n",
      "down on the grass, which was very short and soft, where I slept sounder\n",
      "than ever I remembered to have done in my life, and, as I reckoned, about\n",
      "nine hours; for when I awaked, it was just day-light.  I attempted to\n",
      "rise, but was not able to stir: for, as I happened to lie on my back, I\n",
      "found my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to the ground;\n",
      "and my hair, which was long and thick, tied down in the same manner.  I\n",
      "likewise felt several slender ligatures across my body, from my arm-pits\n",
      "to my thighs.  I could only look upwards; the sun began to grow hot, and\n",
      "the light offended my eyes.  I heard a confused noise about me; but in\n",
      "the posture I lay, could see nothing except the sky.  In a little time I\n",
      "felt something alive moving on my left leg, which advancing gently\n",
      "forward over my breast, came almost up to my chin; when, bending my eyes\n",
      "downwards as much as I could, I perceived it to be a human creature not\n",
      "six inches high, with a bow and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his\n",
      "back.  In the mean time, I felt at least forty more of the same kind (as\n",
      "I conjectured) following the first.  I was in the utmost astonishment,\n",
      "and roared so loud, that they all ran back in a fright; and some of them,\n",
      "as I was afterwards told, were hurt with the falls they got by leaping\n",
      "from my sides upon the ground.  However, they soon returned, and one of\n",
      "them, who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face, lifting up\n",
      "his hands and eyes by way of admiration, cried out in a shrill but\n",
      "distinct voice, _Hekinah degul_: the others repeated the same words\n",
      "several times, but then I knew not what they meant.  I lay all this\n",
      "while, as the reader may believe, in great uneasiness.  At length,\n",
      "struggling to get loose, I had the fortune to break the strings, and\n",
      "wrench out the pegs that fastened my left arm to the ground; for, by\n",
      "lifting it up to my face, I discovered the methods they had taken to bind\n",
      "me, and at the same time with a violent pull, which gave me excessive\n",
      "pain, I a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair on the left\n",
      "side, so that I was just able to turn my head about two inches.  But the\n",
      "creatures ran off a second time, before I could seize them; whereupon\n",
      "there was a great shout in a very shrill accent, and after it ceased I\n",
      "heard one of them cry aloud _Tolgo phonac_; when in an instant I felt\n",
      "above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand, which, pricked me like\n",
      "so many needles; and besides, they shot another flight into the air, as\n",
      "we do bombs in Europe, whereof many, I suppose, fell on my body, (though\n",
      "I felt them not), and some on my face, which I immediately covered with\n",
      "my left hand.  When this shower of arrows was over, I fell a groaning\n",
      "with grief and pain; and then striving again to get loose, they\n",
      "discharged another volley larger than the first, and some of them\n",
      "attempted with spears to stick me in the sides; but by good luck I had on\n",
      "a buff jerkin, which they could not pierce.  I thought it the most\n",
      "prudent method to lie still, and my design was to continue so till night,\n",
      "when, my left hand being already loose, I could easily free myself: and\n",
      "as for the inhabitants, I had reason to believe I might be a match for\n",
      "the greatest army they could bring against me, if they were all of the\n",
      "same size with him that I saw.  But fortune disposed otherwise of me.\n",
      "When the people observed I was quiet, they discharged no more arrows;\n",
      "but, by the noise I heard, I knew their numbers increased; and about four\n",
      "yards from me, over against my right ear, I heard a knocking for above an\n",
      "hour, like that of people at work; when turning my head that way, as well\n",
      "as the pegs and strings would permit me, I saw a stage erected about a\n",
      "foot and a half from the ground, capable of holding four of the\n",
      "inhabitants, with two or three ladders to mount it: from whence one of\n",
      "them, who seemed to be a person of quality, made me a long speech,\n",
      "whereof I understood not one syllable.  But I should have mentioned, that\n",
      "before the principal person began his oration, he cried out three times,\n",
      "_Langro dehul san_ (these words and the former were afterwards repeated\n",
      "and explained to me); whereupon, immediately, about fifty of the\n",
      "inhabitants came and cut the strings that fastened the left side of my\n",
      "head, which gave me the liberty of turning it to the right, and of\n",
      "observing the person and gesture of him that was to speak.  He appeared\n",
      "to be of a middle age, and taller than any of the other three who\n",
      "attended him, whereof one was a page that held up his train, and seemed\n",
      "to be somewhat longer than my middle finger; the other two stood one on\n",
      "each side to support him.  He acted every part of an orator, and I could\n",
      "observe many periods of threatenings, and others of promises, pity, and\n",
      "kindness.  I answered in a few words, but in the most submissive manner,\n",
      "lifting up my left hand, and both my eyes to the sun, as calling him for\n",
      "a witness; and being almost famished with hunger, having not eaten a\n",
      "morsel for some hours before I left the ship, I found the demands of\n",
      "nature so strong upon me, that I could not forbear showing my impatience\n",
      "(perhaps against the strict rules of decency) by putting my finger\n",
      "frequently to my mouth, to signify that I wanted food.  The _hurgo_ (for\n",
      "so they call a great lord, as I afterwards learnt) understood me very\n",
      "well.  He descended from the stage, and commanded that several ladders\n",
      "should be applied to my sides, on which above a hundred of the\n",
      "inhabitants mounted and walked towards my mouth, laden with baskets full\n",
      "of meat, which had been provided and sent thither by the king’s orders,\n",
      "upon the first intelligence he received of me.  I observed there was the\n",
      "flesh of several animals, but could not distinguish them by the taste.\n",
      "There were shoulders, legs, and loins, shaped like those of mutton, and\n",
      "very well dressed, but smaller than the wings of a lark.  I ate them by\n",
      "two or three at a mouthful, and took three loaves at a time, about the\n",
      "bigness of musket bullets.  They supplied me as fast as they could,\n",
      "showing a thousand marks of wonder and astonishment at my bulk and\n",
      "appetite.  I then made another sign, that I wanted drink.  They found by\n",
      "my eating that a small quantity would not suffice me; and being a most\n",
      "ingenious people, they slung up, with great dexterity, one of their\n",
      "largest hogsheads, then rolled it towards my hand, and beat out the top;\n",
      "I drank it off at a draught, which I might well do, for it did not hold\n",
      "half a pint, and tasted like a small wine of Burgundy, but much more\n",
      "delicious.  They brought me a second hogshead, which I drank in the same\n",
      "manner, and made signs for more; but they had none to give me.  When I\n",
      "had performed these wonders, they shouted for joy, and danced upon my\n",
      "breast, repeating several times as they did at first, _Hekinah degul_.\n",
      "They made me a sign that I should throw down the two hogsheads, but first\n",
      "warning the people below to stand out of the way, crying aloud, _Borach\n",
      "mevolah_; and when they saw the vessels in the air, there was a universal\n",
      "shout of _Hekinah degul_.  I confess I was often tempted, while they were\n",
      "passing backwards and forwards on my body, to seize forty or fifty of the\n",
      "first that came in my reach, and dash them against the ground.  But the\n",
      "remembrance of what I had felt, which probably might not be the worst\n",
      "they could do, and the promise of honour I made them—for so I interpreted\n",
      "my submissive behaviour—soon drove out these imaginations.  Besides, I\n",
      "now considered myself as bound by the laws of hospitality, to a people\n",
      "who had treated me with so much expense and magnificence.  However, in my\n",
      "thoughts I could not sufficiently wonder at the intrepidity of these\n",
      "diminutive mortals, who durst venture to mount and walk upon my body,\n",
      "while one of my hands was at liberty, without trembling at the very sight\n",
      "of so prodigious a creature as I must appear to them.  After some time,\n",
      "when they observed that I made no more demands for meat, there appeared\n",
      "before me a person of high rank from his imperial majesty.  His\n",
      "excellency, having mounted on the small of my right leg, advanced\n",
      "forwards up to my face, with about a dozen of his retinue; and producing\n",
      "his credentials under the signet royal, which he applied close to my\n",
      "eyes, spoke about ten minutes without any signs of anger, but with a kind\n",
      "of determinate resolution, often pointing forwards, which, as I\n",
      "afterwards found, was towards the capital city, about half a mile\n",
      "distant; whither it was agreed by his majesty in council that I must be\n",
      "conveyed.  I answered in few words, but to no purpose, and made a sign\n",
      "with my hand that was loose, putting it to the other (but over his\n",
      "excellency’s head for fear of hurting him or his train) and then to my\n",
      "own head and body, to signify that I desired my liberty.  It appeared\n",
      "that he understood me well enough, for he shook his head by way of\n",
      "disapprobation, and held his hand in a posture to show that I must be\n",
      "carried as a prisoner.  However, he made other signs to let me understand\n",
      "that I should have meat and drink enough, and very good treatment.\n",
      "Whereupon I once more thought of attempting to break my bonds; but again,\n",
      "when I felt the smart of their arrows upon my face and hands, which were\n",
      "all in blisters, and many of the darts still sticking in them, and\n",
      "observing likewise that the number of my enemies increased, I gave tokens\n",
      "to let them know that they might do with me what they pleased.  Upon\n",
      "this, the _hurgo_ and his train withdrew, with much civility and cheerful\n",
      "countenances.  Soon after I heard a general shout, with frequent\n",
      "repetitions of the words _Peplom selan_; and I felt great numbers of\n",
      "people on my left side relaxing the cords to such a degree, that I was\n",
      "able to turn upon my right, and to ease myself with making water; which I\n",
      "very plentifully did, to the great astonishment of the people; who,\n",
      "conjecturing by my motion what I was going to do, immediately opened to\n",
      "the right and left on that side, to avoid the torrent, which fell with\n",
      "such noise and violence from me.  But before this, they had daubed my\n",
      "face and both my hands with a sort of ointment, very pleasant to the\n",
      "smell, which, in a few minutes, removed all the smart of their arrows.\n",
      "These circumstances, added to the refreshment I had received by their\n",
      "victuals and drink, which were very nourishing, disposed me to sleep.  I\n",
      "slept about eight hours, as I was afterwards assured; and it was no\n",
      "wonder, for the physicians, by the emperor’s order, had mingled a sleepy\n",
      "potion in the hogsheads of wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems, that upon the first moment I was discovered sleeping on the\n",
      "ground, after my landing, the emperor had early notice of it by an\n",
      "express; and determined in council, that I should be tied in the manner I\n",
      "have related, (which was done in the night while I slept;) that plenty of\n",
      "meat and drink should be sent to me, and a machine prepared to carry me\n",
      "to the capital city.\n",
      "\n",
      "This resolution perhaps may appear very bold and dangerous, and I am\n",
      "confident would not be imitated by any prince in Europe on the like\n",
      "occasion.  However, in my opinion, it was extremely prudent, as well as\n",
      "generous: for, supposing these people had endeavoured to kill me with\n",
      "their spears and arrows, while I was asleep, I should certainly have\n",
      "awaked with the first sense of smart, which might so far have roused my\n",
      "rage and strength, as to have enabled me to break the strings wherewith I\n",
      "was tied; after which, as they were not able to make resistance, so they\n",
      "could expect no mercy.\n",
      "\n",
      "These people are most excellent mathematicians, and arrived to a great\n",
      "perfection in mechanics, by the countenance and encouragement of the\n",
      "emperor, who is a renowned patron of learning.  This prince has several\n",
      "machines fixed on wheels, for the carriage of trees and other great\n",
      "weights.  He often builds his largest men of war, whereof some are nine\n",
      "feet long, in the woods where the timber grows, and has them carried on\n",
      "these engines three or four hundred yards to the sea.  Five hundred\n",
      "carpenters and engineers were immediately set at work to prepare the\n",
      "greatest engine they had.  It was a frame of wood raised three inches\n",
      "from the ground, about seven feet long, and four wide, moving upon\n",
      "twenty-two wheels.  The shout I heard was upon the arrival of this\n",
      "engine, which, it seems, set out in four hours after my landing.  It was\n",
      "brought parallel to me, as I lay.  But the principal difficulty was to\n",
      "raise and place me in this vehicle.  Eighty poles, each of one foot high,\n",
      "were erected for this purpose, and very strong cords, of the bigness of\n",
      "packthread, were fastened by hooks to many bandages, which the workmen\n",
      "had girt round my neck, my hands, my body, and my legs.  Nine hundred of\n",
      "the strongest men were employed to draw up these cords, by many pulleys\n",
      "fastened on the poles; and thus, in less than three hours, I was raised\n",
      "and slung into the engine, and there tied fast.  All this I was told;\n",
      "for, while the operation was performing, I lay in a profound sleep, by\n",
      "the force of that soporiferous medicine infused into my liquor.  Fifteen\n",
      "hundred of the emperor’s largest horses, each about four inches and a\n",
      "half high, were employed to draw me towards the metropolis, which, as I\n",
      "said, was half a mile distant.\n",
      "\n",
      "About four hours after we began our journey, I awaked by a very\n",
      "ridiculous accident; for the carriage being stopped a while, to adjust\n",
      "something that was out of order, two or three of the young natives had\n",
      "the curiosity to see how I looked when I was asleep; they climbed up into\n",
      "the engine, and advancing very softly to my face, one of them, an officer\n",
      "in the guards, put the sharp end of his half-pike a good way up into my\n",
      "left nostril, which tickled my nose like a straw, and made me sneeze\n",
      "violently; whereupon they stole off unperceived, and it was three weeks\n",
      "before I knew the cause of my waking so suddenly.  We made a long march\n",
      "the remaining part of the day, and, rested at night with five hundred\n",
      "guards on each side of me, half with torches, and half with bows and\n",
      "arrows, ready to shoot me if I should offer to stir.  The next morning at\n",
      "sun-rise we continued our march, and arrived within two hundred yards of\n",
      "the city gates about noon.  The emperor, and all his court, came out to\n",
      "meet us; but his great officers would by no means suffer his majesty to\n",
      "endanger his person by mounting on my body.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the place where the carriage stopped there stood an ancient temple,\n",
      "esteemed to be the largest in the whole kingdom; which, having been\n",
      "polluted some years before by an unnatural murder, was, according to the\n",
      "zeal of those people, looked upon as profane, and therefore had been\n",
      "applied to common use, and all the ornaments and furniture carried away.\n",
      "In this edifice it was determined I should lodge.  The great gate\n",
      "fronting to the north was about four feet high, and almost two feet wide,\n",
      "through which I could easily creep.  On each side of the gate was a small\n",
      "window, not above six inches from the ground: into that on the left side,\n",
      "the king’s smith conveyed fourscore and eleven chains, like those that\n",
      "hang to a lady’s watch in Europe, and almost as large, which were locked\n",
      "to my left leg with six-and-thirty padlocks.  Over against this temple,\n",
      "on the other side of the great highway, at twenty feet distance, there\n",
      "was a turret at least five feet high.  Here the emperor ascended, with\n",
      "many principal lords of his court, to have an opportunity of viewing me,\n",
      "as I was told, for I could not see them.  It was reckoned that above a\n",
      "hundred thousand inhabitants came out of the town upon the same errand;\n",
      "and, in spite of my guards, I believe there could not be fewer than ten\n",
      "thousand at several times, who mounted my body by the help of ladders.\n",
      "But a proclamation was soon issued, to forbid it upon pain of death.\n",
      "When the workmen found it was impossible for me to break loose, they cut\n",
      "all the strings that bound me; whereupon I rose up, with as melancholy a\n",
      "disposition as ever I had in my life.  But the noise and astonishment of\n",
      "the people, at seeing me rise and walk, are not to be expressed.  The\n",
      "chains that held my left leg were about two yards long, and gave me not\n",
      "only the liberty of walking backwards and forwards in a semicircle, but,\n",
      "being fixed within four inches of the gate, allowed me to creep in, and\n",
      "lie at my full length in the temple.\n",

      "CHAPTER II.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The emperor of Lilliput, attended by several of the nobility, comes to\n",
      "see the author in his confinement.  The emperor’s person and habit\n",
      "described.  Learned men appointed to teach the author their language.  He\n",
      "gains favour by his mild disposition.  His pockets are searched, and his\n",
      "sword and pistols taken from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I found myself on my feet, I looked about me, and must confess I\n",
      "never beheld a more entertaining prospect.  The country around appeared\n",
      "like a continued garden, and the enclosed fields, which were generally\n",
      "forty feet square, resembled so many beds of flowers.  These fields were\n",
      "intermingled with woods of half a stang, {301} and the tallest trees, as\n",
      "I could judge, appeared to be seven feet high.  I viewed the town on my\n",
      "left hand, which looked like the painted scene of a city in a theatre.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had been for some hours extremely pressed by the necessities of nature;\n",
      "which was no wonder, it being almost two days since I had last\n",
      "disburdened myself.  I was under great difficulties between urgency and\n",
      "shame.  The best expedient I could think of, was to creep into my house,\n",
      "which I accordingly did; and shutting the gate after me, I went as far as\n",
      "the length of my chain would suffer, and discharged my body of that\n",
      "uneasy load.  But this was the only time I was ever guilty of so\n",
      "uncleanly an action; for which I cannot but hope the candid reader will\n",
      "give some allowance, after he has maturely and impartially considered my\n",
      "case, and the distress I was in.  From this time my constant practice\n",
      "was, as soon as I rose, to perform that business in open air, at the full\n",
      "extent of my chain; and due care was taken every morning before company\n",
      "came, that the offensive matter should be carried off in wheel-barrows,\n",
      "by two servants appointed for that purpose.  I would not have dwelt so\n",
      "long upon a circumstance that, perhaps, at first sight, may appear not\n",
      "very momentous, if I had not thought it necessary to justify my\n",
      "character, in point of cleanliness, to the world; which, I am told, some\n",
      "of my maligners have been pleased, upon this and other occasions, to call\n",
      "in question.\n",
      "\n",
      "When this adventure was at an end, I came back out of my house, having\n",
      "occasion for fresh air.  The emperor was already descended from the\n",
      "tower, and advancing on horseback towards me, which had like to have cost\n",
      "him dear; for the beast, though very well trained, yet wholly unused to\n",
      "such a sight, which appeared as if a mountain moved before him, reared up\n",
      "on its hinder feet: but that prince, who is an excellent horseman, kept\n",
      "his seat, till his attendants ran in, and held the bridle, while his\n",
      "majesty had time to dismount.  When he alighted, he surveyed me round\n",
      "with great admiration; but kept beyond the length of my chain.  He\n",
      "ordered his cooks and butlers, who were already prepared, to give me\n",
      "victuals and drink, which they pushed forward in a sort of vehicles upon\n",
      "wheels, till I could reach them.  I took these vehicles and soon emptied\n",
      "them all; twenty of them were filled with meat, and ten with liquor; each\n",
      "of the former afforded me two or three good mouthfuls; and I emptied the\n",
      "liquor of ten vessels, which was contained in earthen vials, into one\n",
      "vehicle, drinking it off at a draught; and so I did with the rest.  The\n",
      "empress, and young princes of the blood of both sexes, attended by many\n",
      "ladies, sat at some distance in their chairs; but upon the accident that\n",
      "happened to the emperor’s horse, they alighted, and came near his person,\n",
      "which I am now going to describe.  He is taller by almost the breadth of\n",
      "my nail, than any of his court; which alone is enough to strike an awe\n",
      "into the beholders.  His features are strong and masculine, with an\n",
      "Austrian lip and arched nose, his complexion olive, his countenance\n",
      "erect, his body and limbs well proportioned, all his motions graceful,\n",
      "and his deportment majestic.  He was then past his prime, being\n",
      "twenty-eight years and three quarters old, of which he had reigned about\n",
      "seven in great felicity, and generally victorious.  For the better\n",
      "convenience of beholding him, I lay on my side, so that my face was\n",
      "parallel to his, and he stood but three yards off: however, I have had\n",
      "him since many times in my hand, and therefore cannot be deceived in the\n",
      "description.  His dress was very plain and simple, and the fashion of it\n",
      "between the Asiatic and the European; but he had on his head a light\n",
      "helmet of gold, adorned with jewels, and a plume on the crest.  He held\n",
      "his sword drawn in his hand to defend himself, if I should happen to\n",
      "break loose; it was almost three inches long; the hilt and scabbard were\n",
      "gold enriched with diamonds.  His voice was shrill, but very clear and\n",
      "articulate; and I could distinctly hear it when I stood up.  The ladies\n",
      "and courtiers were all most magnificently clad; so that the spot they\n",
      "stood upon seemed to resemble a petticoat spread upon the ground,\n",
      "embroidered with figures of gold and silver.  His imperial majesty spoke\n",
      "often to me, and I returned answers: but neither of us could understand a\n",
      "syllable.  There were several of his priests and lawyers present (as I\n",
      "conjectured by their habits), who were commanded to address themselves to\n",
      "me; and I spoke to them in as many languages as I had the least\n",
      "smattering of, which were High and Low Dutch, Latin, French, Spanish,\n",
      "Italian, and Lingua Franca, but all to no purpose.  After about two hours\n",
      "the court retired, and I was left with a strong guard, to prevent the\n",
      "impertinence, and probably the malice of the rabble, who were very\n",
      "impatient to crowd about me as near as they durst; and some of them had\n",
      "the impudence to shoot their arrows at me, as I sat on the ground by the\n",
      "door of my house, whereof one very narrowly missed my left eye.  But the\n",
      "colonel ordered six of the ringleaders to be seized, and thought no\n",
      "punishment so proper as to deliver them bound into my hands; which some\n",
      "of his soldiers accordingly did, pushing them forward with the butt-ends\n",
      "of their pikes into my reach.  I took them all in my right hand, put five\n",
      "of them into my coat-pocket; and as to the sixth, I made a countenance as\n",
      "if I would eat him alive.  The poor man squalled terribly, and the\n",
      "colonel and his officers were in much pain, especially when they saw me\n",
      "take out my penknife: but I soon put them out of fear; for, looking\n",
      "mildly, and immediately cutting the strings he was bound with, I set him\n",
      "gently on the ground, and away he ran.  I treated the rest in the same\n",
      "manner, taking them one by one out of my pocket; and I observed both the\n",
      "soldiers and people were highly delighted at this mark of my clemency,\n",
      "which was represented very much to my advantage at court.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards night I got with some difficulty into my house, where I lay on\n",
      "the ground, and continued to do so about a fortnight; during which time,\n",
      "the emperor gave orders to have a bed prepared for me.  Six hundred beds\n",
      "of the common measure were brought in carriages, and worked up in my\n",
      "house; a hundred and fifty of their beds, sewn together, made up the\n",
      "breadth and length; and these were four double: which, however, kept me\n",
      "but very indifferently from the hardness of the floor, that was of smooth\n",
      "stone.  By the same computation, they provided me with sheets, blankets,\n",
      "and coverlets, tolerable enough for one who had been so long inured to\n",
      "hardships.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the news of my arrival spread through the kingdom, it brought\n",
      "prodigious numbers of rich, idle, and curious people to see me; so that\n",
      "the villages were almost emptied; and great neglect of tillage and\n",
      "household affairs must have ensued, if his imperial majesty had not\n",
      "provided, by several proclamations and orders of state, against this\n",
      "inconveniency.  He directed that those who had already beheld me should\n",
      "return home, and not presume to come within fifty yards of my house,\n",
      "without license from the court; whereby the secretaries of state got\n",
      "considerable fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the mean time the emperor held frequent councils, to debate what\n",
      "course should be taken with me; and I was afterwards assured by a\n",
      "particular friend, a person of great quality, who was as much in the\n",
      "secret as any, that the court was under many difficulties concerning me.\n",
      "They apprehended my breaking loose; that my diet would be very expensive,\n",
      "and might cause a famine.  Sometimes they determined to starve me; or at\n",
      "least to shoot me in the face and hands with poisoned arrows, which would\n",
      "soon despatch me; but again they considered, that the stench of so large\n",
      "a carcass might produce a plague in the metropolis, and probably spread\n",
      "through the whole kingdom.  In the midst of these consultations, several\n",
      "officers of the army went to the door of the great council-chamber, and\n",
      "two of them being admitted, gave an account of my behaviour to the six\n",
      "criminals above-mentioned; which made so favourable an impression in the\n",
      "breast of his majesty and the whole board, in my behalf, that an imperial\n",
      "commission was issued out, obliging all the villages, nine hundred yards\n",
      "round the city, to deliver in every morning six beeves, forty sheep, and\n",
      "other victuals for my sustenance; together with a proportionable quantity\n",
      "of bread, and wine, and other liquors; for the due payment of which, his\n",
      "majesty gave assignments upon his treasury:—for this prince lives chiefly\n",
      "upon his own demesnes; seldom, except upon great occasions, raising any\n",
      "subsidies upon his subjects, who are bound to attend him in his wars at\n",
      "their own expense.  An establishment was also made of six hundred persons\n",
      "to be my domestics, who had board-wages allowed for their maintenance,\n",
      "and tents built for them very conveniently on each side of my door.  It\n",
      "was likewise ordered, that three hundred tailors should make me a suit of\n",
      "clothes, after the fashion of the country; that six of his majesty’s\n",
      "greatest scholars should be employed to instruct me in their language;\n",
      "and lastly, that the emperor’s horses, and those of the nobility and\n",
      "troops of guards, should be frequently exercised in my sight, to accustom\n",
      "themselves to me.  All these orders were duly put in execution; and in\n",
      "about three weeks I made a great progress in learning their language;\n",
      "during which time the emperor frequently honoured me with his visits, and\n",
      "was pleased to assist my masters in teaching me.  We began already to\n",
      "converse together in some sort; and the first words I learnt, were to\n",
      "express my desire “that he would please give me my liberty;” which I\n",
      "every day repeated on my knees.  His answer, as I could comprehend it,\n",
      "was, “that this must be a work of time, not to be thought on without the\n",
      "advice of his council, and that first I must _lumos kelmin pesso desmar\n",
      "lon emposo_;” that is, swear a peace with him and his kingdom.  However,\n",
      "that I should be used with all kindness.  And he advised me to “acquire,\n",
      "by my patience and discreet behaviour, the good opinion of himself and\n",
      "his subjects.”  He desired “I would not take it ill, if he gave orders to\n",
      "certain proper officers to search me; for probably I might carry about me\n",
      "several weapons, which must needs be dangerous things, if they answered\n",
      "the bulk of so prodigious a person.”  I said, “His majesty should be\n",
      "satisfied; for I was ready to strip myself, and turn up my pockets before\n",
      "him.”  This I delivered part in words, and part in signs.  He replied,\n",
      "“that, by the laws of the kingdom, I must be searched by two of his\n",
      "officers; that he knew this could not be done without my consent and\n",
      "assistance; and he had so good an opinion of my generosity and justice,\n",
      "as to trust their persons in my hands; that whatever they took from me,\n",
      "should be returned when I left the country, or paid for at the rate which\n",
      "I would set upon them.”  I took up the two officers in my hands, put them\n",
      "first into my coat-pockets, and then into every other pocket about me,\n",
      "except my two fobs, and another secret pocket, which I had no mind should\n",
      "be searched, wherein I had some little necessaries that were of no\n",
      "consequence to any but myself.  In one of my fobs there was a silver\n",
      "watch, and in the other a small quantity of gold in a purse.  These\n",
      "gentlemen, having pen, ink, and paper, about them, made an exact\n",
      "inventory of every thing they saw; and when they had done, desired I\n",
      "would set them down, that they might deliver it to the emperor.  This\n",
      "inventory I afterwards translated into English, and is, word for word, as\n",
      "follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Imprimis_: In the right coat-pocket of the great man-mountain” (for\n",
      "so I interpret the words _quinbus flestrin_,) “after the strictest\n",
      "search, we found only one great piece of coarse-cloth, large enough\n",
      "to be a foot-cloth for your majesty’s chief room of state.  In the\n",
      "left pocket we saw a huge silver chest, with a cover of the same\n",
      "metal, which we, the searchers, were not able to lift.  We desired it\n",
      "should be opened, and one of us stepping into it, found himself up to\n",
      "the mid leg in a sort of dust, some part whereof flying up to our\n",
      "faces set us both a sneezing for several times together.  In his\n",
      "right waistcoat-pocket we found a prodigious bundle of white thin\n",
      "substances, folded one over another, about the bigness of three men,\n",
      "tied with a strong cable, and marked with black figures; which we\n",
      "humbly conceive to be writings, every letter almost half as large as\n",
      "the palm of our hands.  In the left there was a sort of engine, from\n",
      "the back of which were extended twenty long poles, resembling the\n",
      "pallisados before your majesty’s court: wherewith we conjecture the\n",
      "man-mountain combs his head; for we did not always trouble him with\n",
      "questions, because we found it a great difficulty to make him\n",
      "understand us.  In the large pocket, on the right side of his middle\n",
      "cover” (so I translate the word _ranfulo_, by which they meant my\n",
      "breeches,) “we saw a hollow pillar of iron, about the length of a\n",
      "man, fastened to a strong piece of timber larger than the pillar; and\n",
      "upon one side of the pillar, were huge pieces of iron sticking out,\n",
      "cut into strange figures, which we know not what to make of.  In the\n",
      "left pocket, another engine of the same kind.  In the smaller pocket\n",
      "on the right side, were several round flat pieces of white and red\n",
      "metal, of different bulk; some of the white, which seemed to be\n",
      "silver, were so large and heavy, that my comrade and I could hardly\n",
      "lift them.  In the left pocket were two black pillars irregularly\n",
      "shaped: we could not, without difficulty, reach the top of them, as\n",
      "we stood at the bottom of his pocket.  One of them was covered, and\n",
      "seemed all of a piece: but at the upper end of the other there\n",
      "appeared a white round substance, about twice the bigness of our\n",
      "heads.  Within each of these was enclosed a prodigious plate of\n",
      "steel; which, by our orders, we obliged him to show us, because we\n",
      "apprehended they might be dangerous engines.  He took them out of\n",
      "their cases, and told us, that in his own country his practice was to\n",
      "shave his beard with one of these, and cut his meat with the other.\n",
      "There were two pockets which we could not enter: these he called his\n",
      "fobs; they were two large slits cut into the top of his middle cover,\n",
      "but squeezed close by the pressure of his belly.  Out of the right\n",
      "fob hung a great silver chain, with a wonderful kind of engine at the\n",
      "bottom.  We directed him to draw out whatever was at the end of that\n",
      "chain; which appeared to be a globe, half silver, and half of some\n",
      "transparent metal; for, on the transparent side, we saw certain\n",
      "strange figures circularly drawn, and thought we could touch them,\n",
      "till we found our fingers stopped by the lucid substance.  He put\n",
      "this engine into our ears, which made an incessant noise, like that\n",
      "of a water-mill: and we conjecture it is either some unknown animal,\n",
      "or the god that he worships; but we are more inclined to the latter\n",
      "opinion, because he assured us, (if we understood him right, for he\n",
      "expressed himself very imperfectly) that he seldom did any thing\n",
      "without consulting it.  He called it his oracle, and said, it pointed\n",
      "out the time for every action of his life.  From the left fob he took\n",
      "out a net almost large enough for a fisherman, but contrived to open\n",
      "and shut like a purse, and served him for the same use: we found\n",
      "therein several massy pieces of yellow metal, which, if they be real\n",
      "gold, must be of immense value.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Having thus, in obedience to your majesty’s commands, diligently\n",
      "searched all his pockets, we observed a girdle about his waist made\n",
      "of the hide of some prodigious animal, from which, on the left side,\n",
      "hung a sword of the length of five men; and on the right, a bag or\n",
      "pouch divided into two cells, each cell capable of holding three of\n",
      "your majesty’s subjects.  In one of these cells were several globes,\n",
      "or balls, of a most ponderous metal, about the bigness of our heads,\n",
      "and requiring a strong hand to lift them: the other cell contained a\n",
      "heap of certain black grains, but of no great bulk or weight, for we\n",
      "could hold above fifty of them in the palms of our hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is an exact inventory of what we found about the body of the\n",
      "man-mountain, who used us with great civility, and due respect to\n",
      "your majesty’s commission.  Signed and sealed on the fourth day of\n",
      "the eighty-ninth moon of your majesty’s auspicious reign.\n",
      "\n",
      "CLEFRIN FRELOCK, MARSI FRELOCK.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When this inventory was read over to the emperor, he directed me,\n",
      "although in very gentle terms, to deliver up the several particulars.  He\n",
      "first called for my scimitar, which I took out, scabbard and all.  In the\n",
      "mean time he ordered three thousand of his choicest troops (who then\n",
      "attended him) to surround me at a distance, with their bows and arrows\n",
      "just ready to discharge; but I did not observe it, for mine eyes were\n",
      "wholly fixed upon his majesty.  He then desired me to draw my scimitar,\n",
      "which, although it had got some rust by the sea water, was, in most\n",
      "parts, exceeding bright.  I did so, and immediately all the troops gave a\n",
      "shout between terror and surprise; for the sun shone clear, and the\n",
      "reflection dazzled their eyes, as I waved the scimitar to and fro in my\n",
      "hand.  His majesty, who is a most magnanimous prince, was less daunted\n",
      "than I could expect: he ordered me to return it into the scabbard, and\n",
      "cast it on the ground as gently as I could, about six feet from the end\n",
      "of my chain.  The next thing he demanded was one of the hollow iron\n",
      "pillars; by which he meant my pocket pistols.  I drew it out, and at his\n",
      "desire, as well as I could, expressed to him the use of it; and charging\n",
      "it only with powder, which, by the closeness of my pouch, happened to\n",
      "escape wetting in the sea (an inconvenience against which all prudent\n",
      "mariners take special care to provide,) I first cautioned the emperor not\n",
      "to be afraid, and then I let it off in the air.  The astonishment here\n",
      "was much greater than at the sight of my scimitar.  Hundreds fell down as\n",
      "if they had been struck dead; and even the emperor, although he stood his\n",
      "ground, could not recover himself for some time.  I delivered up both my\n",
      "pistols in the same manner as I had done my scimitar, and then my pouch\n",
      "of powder and bullets; begging him that the former might be kept from\n",
      "fire, for it would kindle with the smallest spark, and blow up his\n",
      "imperial palace into the air.  I likewise delivered up my watch, which\n",
      "the emperor was very curious to see, and commanded two of his tallest\n",
      "yeomen of the guards to bear it on a pole upon their shoulders, as\n",
      "draymen in England do a barrel of ale.  He was amazed at the continual\n",
      "noise it made, and the motion of the minute-hand, which he could easily\n",
      "discern; for their sight is much more acute than ours: he asked the\n",
      "opinions of his learned men about it, which were various and remote, as\n",
      "the reader may well imagine without my repeating; although indeed I could\n",
      "not very perfectly understand them.  I then gave up my silver and copper\n",
      "money, my purse, with nine large pieces of gold, and some smaller ones;\n",
      "my knife and razor, my comb and silver snuff-box, my handkerchief and\n",
      "journal-book.  My scimitar, pistols, and pouch, were conveyed in\n",
      "carriages to his majesty’s stores; but the rest of my goods were returned\n",

      "the weakness of mine eyes,) a pocket perspective, and some other little\n",
      "conveniences; which, being of no consequence to the emperor, I did not\n",

      "\n",
      "The author diverts the emperor, and his nobility of both sexes, in a very\n",
      "uncommon manner.  The diversions of the court of Lilliput described.  The\n",
      "author has his liberty granted him upon certain conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "My gentleness and good behaviour had gained so far on the emperor and his\n",
      "court, and indeed upon the army and people in general, that I began to\n",
      "conceive hopes of getting my liberty in a short time.  I took all\n",
      "possible methods to cultivate this favourable disposition.  The natives\n",
      "came, by degrees, to be less apprehensive of any danger from me.  I would\n",
      "sometimes lie down, and let five or six of them dance on my hand; and at\n",
      "last the boys and girls would venture to come and play at hide-and-seek\n",
      "in my hair.  I had now made a good progress in understanding and speaking\n",
      "the language.  The emperor had a mind one day to entertain me with\n",
      "several of the country shows, wherein they exceed all nations I have\n",
      "known, both for dexterity and magnificence.  I was diverted with none so\n",
      "much as that of the rope-dancers, performed upon a slender white thread,\n",
      "extended about two feet, and twelve inches from the ground.  Upon which I\n",
      "shall desire liberty, with the reader’s patience, to enlarge a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "This diversion is only practised by those persons who are candidates for\n",
      "great employments, and high favour at court.  They are trained in this\n",
      "art from their youth, and are not always of noble birth, or liberal\n",
      "education.  When a great office is vacant, either by death or disgrace\n",
      "(which often happens,) five or six of those candidates petition the\n",
      "emperor to entertain his majesty and the court with a dance on the rope;\n",
      "and whoever jumps the highest, without falling, succeeds in the office.\n",
      "Very often the chief ministers themselves are commanded to show their\n",
      "skill, and to convince the emperor that they have not lost their faculty.\n",
      "Flimnap, the treasurer, is allowed to cut a caper on the straight rope,\n",
      "at least an inch higher than any other lord in the whole empire.  I have\n",
      "seen him do the summerset several times together, upon a trencher fixed\n",
      "on a rope which is no thicker than a common packthread in England.  My\n",
      "friend Reldresal, principal secretary for private affairs, is, in my\n",
      "opinion, if I am not partial, the second after the treasurer; the rest of\n",
      "the great officers are much upon a par.\n",
      "\n",
      "These diversions are often attended with fatal accidents, whereof great\n",
      "numbers are on record.  I myself have seen two or three candidates break\n",
      "a limb.  But the danger is much greater, when the ministers themselves\n",
      "are commanded to show their dexterity; for, by contending to excel\n",
      "themselves and their fellows, they strain so far that there is hardly one\n",
      "of them who has not received a fall, and some of them two or three.  I\n",
      "was assured that, a year or two before my arrival, Flimnap would\n",
      "infallibly have broke his neck, if one of the king’s cushions, that\n",
      "accidentally lay on the ground, had not weakened the force of his fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is likewise another diversion, which is only shown before the\n",
      "emperor and empress, and first minister, upon particular occasions.  The\n",
      "emperor lays on the table three fine silken threads of six inches long;\n",
      "one is blue, the other red, and the third green.  These threads are\n",
      "proposed as prizes for those persons whom the emperor has a mind to\n",
      "distinguish by a peculiar mark of his favour.  The ceremony is performed\n",
      "in his majesty’s great chamber of state, where the candidates are to\n",
      "undergo a trial of dexterity very different from the former, and such as\n",
      "I have not observed the least resemblance of in any other country of the\n",
      "new or old world.  The emperor holds a stick in his hands, both ends\n",
      "parallel to the horizon, while the candidates advancing, one by one,\n",
      "sometimes leap over the stick, sometimes creep under it, backward and\n",
      "forward, several times, according as the stick is advanced or depressed.\n",
      "Sometimes the emperor holds one end of the stick, and his first minister\n",
      "the other; sometimes the minister has it entirely to himself.  Whoever\n",
      "performs his part with most agility, and holds out the longest in leaping\n",
      "and creeping, is rewarded with the blue-coloured silk; the red is given\n",
      "to the next, and the green to the third, which they all wear girt twice\n",
      "round about the middle; and you see few great persons about this court\n",
      "who are not adorned with one of these girdles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The horses of the army, and those of the royal stables, having been daily\n",
      "led before me, were no longer shy, but would come up to my very feet\n",
      "without starting.  The riders would leap them over my hand, as I held it\n",
      "on the ground; and one of the emperor’s huntsmen, upon a large courser,\n",
      "took my foot, shoe and all; which was indeed a prodigious leap.  I had\n",
      "the good fortune to divert the emperor one day after a very extraordinary\n",
      "manner.  I desired he would order several sticks of two feet high, and\n",
      "the thickness of an ordinary cane, to be brought me; whereupon his\n",
      "majesty commanded the master of his woods to give directions accordingly;\n",
      "and the next morning six woodmen arrived with as many carriages, drawn by\n",
      "eight horses to each.  I took nine of these sticks, and fixing them\n",
      "firmly in the ground in a quadrangular figure, two feet and a half\n",
      "square, I took four other sticks, and tied them parallel at each corner,\n",
      "about two feet from the ground; then I fastened my handkerchief to the\n",
      "nine sticks that stood erect; and extended it on all sides, till it was\n",
      "tight as the top of a drum; and the four parallel sticks, rising about\n",
      "five inches higher than the handkerchief, served as ledges on each side.\n",
      "When I had finished my work, I desired the emperor to let a troop of his\n",
      "best horses twenty-four in number, come and exercise upon this plain.\n",
      "His majesty approved of the proposal, and I took them up, one by one, in\n",
      "my hands, ready mounted and armed, with the proper officers to exercise\n",
      "them.  As soon as they got into order they divided into two parties,\n",
      "performed mock skirmishes, discharged blunt arrows, drew their swords,\n",
      "fled and pursued, attacked and retired, and in short discovered the best\n",
      "military discipline I ever beheld.  The parallel sticks secured them and\n",
      "their horses from falling over the stage; and the emperor was so much\n",
      "delighted, that he ordered this entertainment to be repeated several\n",
      "days, and once was pleased to be lifted up and give the word of command;\n",
      "and with great difficulty persuaded even the empress herself to let me\n",
      "hold her in her close chair within two yards of the stage, when she was\n",
      "able to take a full view of the whole performance.  It was my good\n",
      "fortune, that no ill accident happened in these entertainments; only once\n",
      "a fiery horse, that belonged to one of the captains, pawing with his\n",
      "hoof, struck a hole in my handkerchief, and his foot slipping, he\n",
      "overthrew his rider and himself; but I immediately relieved them both,\n",
      "and covering the hole with one hand, I set down the troop with the other,\n",
      "in the same manner as I took them up. The horse that fell was strained in\n",
      "the left shoulder, but the rider got no hurt; and I repaired my\n",
      "handkerchief as well as I could: however, I would not trust to the\n",
      "strength of it any more, in such dangerous enterprises.\n",
      "\n",
      "About two or three days before I was set at liberty, as I was\n",
      "entertaining the court with this kind of feat, there arrived an express\n",
      "to inform his majesty, that some of his subjects, riding near the place\n",
      "where I was first taken up, had seen a great black substance lying on the\n",
      "around, very oddly shaped, extending its edges round, as wide as his\n",
      "majesty’s bedchamber, and rising up in the middle as high as a man; that\n",
      "it was no living creature, as they at first apprehended, for it lay on\n",
      "the grass without motion; and some of them had walked round it several\n",
      "times; that, by mounting upon each other’s shoulders, they had got to the\n",
      "top, which was flat and even, and, stamping upon it, they found that it\n",
      "was hollow within; that they humbly conceived it might be something\n",
      "belonging to the man-mountain; and if his majesty pleased, they would\n",
      "undertake to bring it with only five horses.  I presently knew what they\n",
      "meant, and was glad at heart to receive this intelligence.  It seems,\n",
      "upon my first reaching the shore after our shipwreck, I was in such\n",
      "confusion, that before I came to the place where I went to sleep, my hat,\n",
      "which I had fastened with a string to my head while I was rowing, and had\n",
      "stuck on all the time I was swimming, fell off after I came to land; the\n",
      "string, as I conjecture, breaking by some accident, which I never\n",
      "observed, but thought my hat had been lost at sea.  I entreated his\n",
      "imperial majesty to give orders it might be brought to me as soon as\n",
      "possible, describing to him the use and the nature of it: and the next\n",
      "day the waggoners arrived with it, but not in a very good condition; they\n",
      "had bored two holes in the brim, within an inch and half of the edge, and\n",
      "fastened two hooks in the holes; these hooks were tied by a long cord to\n",
      "the harness, and thus my hat was dragged along for above half an English\n",
      "mile; but, the ground in that country being extremely smooth and level,\n",
      "it received less damage than I expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two days after this adventure, the emperor, having ordered that part of\n",
      "his army which quarters in and about his metropolis, to be in readiness,\n",
      "took a fancy of diverting himself in a very singular manner.  He desired\n",
      "I would stand like a Colossus, with my legs as far asunder as I\n",
      "conveniently could.  He then commanded his general (who was an old\n",
      "experienced leader, and a great patron of mine) to draw up the troops in\n",
      "close order, and march them under me; the foot by twenty-four abreast,\n",
      "and the horse by sixteen, with drums beating, colours flying, and pikes\n",
      "advanced.  This body consisted of three thousand foot, and a thousand\n",
      "horse.  His majesty gave orders, upon pain of death, that every soldier\n",
      "in his march should observe the strictest decency with regard to my\n",
      "person; which however could not prevent some of the younger officers from\n",
      "turning up their eyes as they passed under me: and, to confess the truth,\n",
      "my breeches were at that time in so ill a condition, that they afforded\n",
      "some opportunities for laughter and admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had sent so many memorials and petitions for my liberty, that his\n",
      "majesty at length mentioned the matter, first in the cabinet, and then in\n",
      "a full council; where it was opposed by none, except Skyresh Bolgolam,\n",
      "who was pleased, without any provocation, to be my mortal enemy.  But it\n",
      "was carried against him by the whole board, and confirmed by the emperor.\n",
      "That minister was _galbet_, or admiral of the realm, very much in his\n",
      "master’s confidence, and a person well versed in affairs, but of a morose\n",
      "and sour complexion.  However, he was at length persuaded to comply; but\n",
      "prevailed that the articles and conditions upon which I should be set\n",
      "free, and to which I must swear, should be drawn up by himself.  These\n",
      "articles were brought to me by Skyresh Bolgolam in person attended by two\n",
      "under-secretaries, and several persons of distinction.  After they were\n",
      "read, I was demanded to swear to the performance of them; first in the\n",
      "manner of my own country, and afterwards in the method prescribed by\n",
      "their laws; which was, to hold my right foot in my left hand, and to\n",
      "place the middle finger of my right hand on the crown of my head, and my\n",
      "thumb on the tip of my right ear.  But because the reader may be curious\n",
      "to have some idea of the style and manner of expression peculiar to that\n",
      "people, as well as to know the article upon which I recovered my liberty,\n",

      "The first request I made, after I had obtained my liberty, was, that I\n",
      "might have license to see Mildendo, the metropolis; which the emperor\n",
      "easily granted me, but with a special charge to do no hurt either to the\n",
      "inhabitants or their houses.  The people had notice, by proclamation, of\n",
      "my design to visit the town.  The wall which encompassed it is two feet\n",
      "and a half high, and at least eleven inches broad, so that a coach and\n",
      "horses may be driven very safely round it; and it is flanked with strong\n",
      "towers at ten feet distance.  I stepped over the great western gate, and\n",
      "passed very gently, and sidling, through the two principal streets, only\n",
      "in my short waistcoat, for fear of damaging the roofs and eaves of the\n",
      "houses with the skirts of my coat.  I walked with the utmost\n",
      "circumspection, to avoid treading on any stragglers who might remain in\n",
      "the streets, although the orders were very strict, that all people should\n",
      "keep in their houses, at their own peril.  The garret windows and tops of\n",
      "houses were so crowded with spectators, that I thought in all my travels\n",
      "I had not seen a more populous place.  The city is an exact square, each\n",
      "side of the wall being five hundred feet long.  The two great streets,\n",
      "which run across and divide it into four quarters, are five feet wide.\n",
      "The lanes and alleys, which I could not enter, but only view them as I\n",
      "passed, are from twelve to eighteen inches.  The town is capable of\n",
      "holding five hundred thousand souls: the houses are from three to five\n",
      "stories: the shops and markets well provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "The emperor’s palace is in the centre of the city where the two great\n",
      "streets meet.  It is enclosed by a wall of two feet high, and twenty feet\n",
      "distance from the buildings.  I had his majesty’s permission to step over\n",
      "this wall; and, the space being so wide between that and the palace, I\n",
      "could easily view it on every side.  The outward court is a square of\n",
      "forty feet, and includes two other courts: in the inmost are the royal\n",
      "apartments, which I was very desirous to see, but found it extremely\n",
      "difficult; for the great gates, from one square into another, were but\n",
      "eighteen inches high, and seven inches wide.  Now the buildings of the\n",
      "outer court were at least five feet high, and it was impossible for me to\n",
      "stride over them without infinite damage to the pile, though the walls\n",
      "were strongly built of hewn stone, and four inches thick.  At the same\n",
      "time the emperor had a great desire that I should see the magnificence of\n",
      "his palace; but this I was not able to do till three days after, which I\n",
      "spent in cutting down with my knife some of the largest trees in the\n",
      "royal park, about a hundred yards distant from the city.  Of these trees\n",
      "I made two stools, each about three feet high, and strong enough to bear\n",
      "my weight.  The people having received notice a second time, I went again\n",
      "through the city to the palace with my two stools in my hands.  When I\n",
      "came to the side of the outer court, I stood upon one stool, and took the\n",
      "other in my hand; this I lifted over the roof, and gently set it down on\n",
      "the space between the first and second court, which was eight feet wide.\n",
      "I then stept over the building very conveniently from one stool to the\n",
      "other, and drew up the first after me with a hooked stick.  By this\n",
      "contrivance I got into the inmost court; and, lying down upon my side, I\n",
      "applied my face to the windows of the middle stories, which were left\n",
      "open on purpose, and discovered the most splendid apartments that can be\n",
      "imagined.  There I saw the empress and the young princes, in their\n",
      "several lodgings, with their chief attendants about them.  Her imperial\n",
      "majesty was pleased to smile very graciously upon me, and gave me out of\n",
      "the window her hand to kiss.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I shall not anticipate the reader with further descriptions of this\n",
      "kind, because I reserve them for a greater work, which is now almost\n",

      "One morning, about a fortnight after I had obtained my liberty,\n",
      "Reldresal, principal secretary (as they style him) for private affairs,\n",
      "came to my house attended only by one servant.  He ordered his coach to\n",
      "wait at a distance, and desired I would give him an hours audience; which\n",
      "I readily consented to, on account of his quality and personal merits, as\n",
      "well as of the many good offices he had done me during my solicitations\n",
      "at court.  I offered to lie down that he might the more conveniently\n",
      "reach my ear, but he chose rather to let me hold him in my hand during\n",
      "our conversation.  He began with compliments on my liberty; said “he\n",
      "might pretend to some merit in it;” but, however, added, “that if it had\n",
      "not been for the present situation of things at court, perhaps I might\n",
      "not have obtained it so soon.  For,” said he, “as flourishing a condition\n",
      "as we may appear to be in to foreigners, we labour under two mighty\n",
      "evils: a violent faction at home, and the danger of an invasion, by a\n",
      "most potent enemy, from abroad.  As to the first, you are to understand,\n",
      "that for about seventy moons past there have been two struggling parties\n",
      "in this empire, under the names of _Tramecksan_ and _Slamecksan_, from\n",
      "the high and low heels of their shoes, by which they distinguish\n",
      "themselves.  It is alleged, indeed, that the high heels are most\n",
      "agreeable to our ancient constitution; but, however this be, his majesty\n",
      "has determined to make use only of low heels in the administration of the\n",
      "government, and all offices in the gift of the crown, as you cannot but\n",
      "observe; and particularly that his majesty’s imperial heels are lower at\n",
      "least by a _drurr_ than any of his court (_drurr_ is a measure about the\n",
      "fourteenth part of an inch).  The animosities between these two parties\n",
      "run so high, that they will neither eat, nor drink, nor talk with each\n",
      "other.  We compute the _Tramecksan_, or high heels, to exceed us in\n",
      "number; but the power is wholly on our side.  We apprehend his imperial\n",
      "highness, the heir to the crown, to have some tendency towards the high\n",
      "heels; at least we can plainly discover that one of his heels is higher\n",
      "than the other, which gives him a hobble in his gait.  Now, in the midst\n",
      "of these intestine disquiets, we are threatened with an invasion from the\n",
      "island of Blefuscu, which is the other great empire of the universe,\n",
      "almost as large and powerful as this of his majesty.  For as to what we\n",
      "have heard you affirm, that there are other kingdoms and states in the\n",
      "world inhabited by human creatures as large as yourself, our philosophers\n",
      "are in much doubt, and would rather conjecture that you dropped from the\n",
      "moon, or one of the stars; because it is certain, that a hundred mortals\n",
      "of your bulk would in a short time destroy all the fruits and cattle of\n",
      "his majesty’s dominions: besides, our histories of six thousand moons\n",
      "make no mention of any other regions than the two great empires of\n",
      "Lilliput and Blefuscu.  Which two mighty powers have, as I was going to\n",
      "tell you, been engaged in a most obstinate war for six-and-thirty moons\n",
      "past.  It began upon the following occasion.  It is allowed on all hands,\n",
      "that the primitive way of breaking eggs, before we eat them, was upon the\n",
      "larger end; but his present majesty’s grandfather, while he was a boy,\n",
      "going to eat an egg, and breaking it according to the ancient practice,\n",
      "happened to cut one of his fingers.  Whereupon the emperor his father\n",
      "published an edict, commanding all his subjects, upon great penalties, to\n",
      "break the smaller end of their eggs.  The people so highly resented this\n",
      "law, that our histories tell us, there have been six rebellions raised on\n",
      "that account; wherein one emperor lost his life, and another his crown.\n",
      "These civil commotions were constantly fomented by the monarchs of\n",
      "Blefuscu; and when they were quelled, the exiles always fled for refuge\n",
      "to that empire.  It is computed that eleven thousand persons have at\n",
      "several times suffered death, rather than submit to break their eggs at\n",
      "the smaller end.  Many hundred large volumes have been published upon\n",
      "this controversy: but the books of the Big-endians have been long\n",
      "forbidden, and the whole party rendered incapable by law of holding\n",
      "employments.  During the course of these troubles, the emperors of\n",
      "Blefusca did frequently expostulate by their ambassadors, accusing us of\n",
      "making a schism in religion, by offending against a fundamental doctrine\n",
      "of our great prophet Lustrog, in the fifty-fourth chapter of the\n",
      "Blundecral (which is their Alcoran).  This, however, is thought to be a\n",
      "mere strain upon the text; for the words are these: ‘that all true\n",
      "believers break their eggs at the convenient end.’  And which is the\n",
      "convenient end, seems, in my humble opinion to be left to every man’s\n",
      "conscience, or at least in the power of the chief magistrate to\n",
      "determine.  Now, the Big-endian exiles have found so much credit in the\n",
      "emperor of Blefuscu’s court, and so much private assistance and\n",
      "encouragement from their party here at home, that a bloody war has been\n",
      "carried on between the two empires for six-and-thirty moons, with various\n",
      "success; during which time we have lost forty capital ships, and a much a\n",
      "greater number of smaller vessels, together with thirty thousand of our\n",
      "best seamen and soldiers; and the damage received by the enemy is\n",
      "reckoned to be somewhat greater than ours.  However, they have now\n",
      "equipped a numerous fleet, and are just preparing to make a descent upon\n",
      "us; and his imperial majesty, placing great confidence in your valour and\n",
      "strength, has commanded me to lay this account of his affairs before\n",
      "you.”\n",

      "The author, by an extraordinary stratagem, prevents an invasion.  A high\n",
      "title of honour is conferred upon him.  Ambassadors arrive from the\n",
      "emperor of Blefuscu, and sue for peace.  The empress’s apartment on fire\n",
      "by an accident; the author instrumental in saving the rest of the palace.\n",

      "The empire of Blefuscu is an island situated to the north-east of\n",
      "Lilliput, from which it is parted only by a channel of eight hundred\n",
      "yards wide.  I had not yet seen it, and upon this notice of an intended\n",
      "invasion, I avoided appearing on that side of the coast, for fear of\n",
      "being discovered, by some of the enemy’s ships, who had received no\n",
      "intelligence of me; all intercourse between the two empires having been\n",
      "strictly forbidden during the war, upon pain of death, and an embargo\n",
      "laid by our emperor upon all vessels whatsoever.  I communicated to his\n",
      "majesty a project I had formed of seizing the enemy’s whole fleet; which,\n",
      "as our scouts assured us, lay at anchor in the harbour, ready to sail\n",
      "with the first fair wind.  I consulted the most experienced seamen upon\n",
      "the depth of the channel, which they had often plumbed; who told me, that\n",
      "in the middle, at high-water, it was seventy _glumgluffs_ deep, which is\n",
      "about six feet of European measure; and the rest of it fifty _glumgluffs_\n",
      "at most.  I walked towards the north-east coast, over against Blefuscu,\n",
      "where, lying down behind a hillock, I took out my small perspective\n",
      "glass, and viewed the enemy’s fleet at anchor, consisting of about fifty\n",
      "men of war, and a great number of transports: I then came back to my\n",
      "house, and gave orders (for which I had a warrant) for a great quantity\n",
      "of the strongest cable and bars of iron.  The cable was about as thick as\n",
      "packthread and the bars of the length and size of a knitting-needle.  I\n",
      "trebled the cable to make it stronger, and for the same reason I twisted\n",
      "three of the iron bars together, bending the extremities into a hook.\n",
      "Having thus fixed fifty hooks to as many cables, I went back to the\n",
      "north-east coast, and putting off my coat, shoes, and stockings, walked\n",
      "into the sea, in my leathern jerkin, about half an hour before high\n",
      "water.  I waded with what haste I could, and swam in the middle about\n",
      "thirty yards, till I felt ground.  I arrived at the fleet in less than\n",
      "half an hour.  The enemy was so frightened when they saw me, that they\n",
      "leaped out of their ships, and swam to shore, where there could not be\n",
      "fewer than thirty thousand souls.  I then took my tackling, and,\n",
      "fastening a hook to the hole at the prow of each, I tied all the cords\n",
      "together at the end.  While I was thus employed, the enemy discharged\n",
      "several thousand arrows, many of which stuck in my hands and face, and,\n",
      "beside the excessive smart, gave me much disturbance in my work.  My\n",
      "greatest apprehension was for mine eyes, which I should have infallibly\n",
      "lost, if I had not suddenly thought of an expedient.  I kept, among other\n",
      "little necessaries, a pair of spectacles in a private pocket, which, as I\n",
      "observed before, had escaped the emperor’s searchers.  These I took out\n",
      "and fastened as strongly as I could upon my nose, and thus armed, went on\n",
      "boldly with my work, in spite of the enemy’s arrows, many of which struck\n",
      "against the glasses of my spectacles, but without any other effect,\n",
      "further than a little to discompose them.  I had now fastened all the\n",
      "hooks, and, taking the knot in my hand, began to pull; but not a ship\n",
      "would stir, for they were all too fast held by their anchors, so that the\n",
      "boldest part of my enterprise remained.  I therefore let go the cord, and\n",
      "leaving the looks fixed to the ships, I resolutely cut with my knife the\n",
      "cables that fastened the anchors, receiving about two hundred shots in my\n",
      "face and hands; then I took up the knotted end of the cables, to which my\n",
      "hooks were tied, and with great ease drew fifty of the enemy’s largest\n",
      "men of war after me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Blefuscudians, who had not the least imagination of what I intended,\n",
      "were at first confounded with astonishment.  They had seen me cut the\n",
      "cables, and thought my design was only to let the ships run adrift or\n",
      "fall foul on each other: but when they perceived the whole fleet moving\n",
      "in order, and saw me pulling at the end, they set up such a scream of\n",
      "grief and despair as it is almost impossible to describe or conceive.\n",
      "When I had got out of danger, I stopped awhile to pick out the arrows\n",
      "that stuck in my hands and face; and rubbed on some of the same ointment\n",
      "that was given me at my first arrival, as I have formerly mentioned.  I\n",
      "then took off my spectacles, and waiting about an hour, till the tide was\n",
      "a little fallen, I waded through the middle with my cargo, and arrived\n",
      "safe at the royal port of Lilliput.\n",
      "\n",
      "The emperor and his whole court stood on the shore, expecting the issue\n",
      "of this great adventure.  They saw the ships move forward in a large\n",
      "half-moon, but could not discern me, who was up to my breast in water.\n",
      "When I advanced to the middle of the channel, they were yet more in pain,\n",
      "because I was under water to my neck.  The emperor concluded me to be\n",
      "drowned, and that the enemy’s fleet was approaching in a hostile manner:\n",
      "but he was soon eased of his fears; for the channel growing shallower\n",
      "every step I made, I came in a short time within hearing, and holding up\n",
      "the end of the cable, by which the fleet was fastened, I cried in a loud\n",
      "voice, “Long live the most puissant king of Lilliput!”  This great prince\n",
      "received me at my landing with all possible encomiums, and created me a\n",
      "_nardac_ upon the spot, which is the highest title of honour among them.\n",
      "\n",
      "His majesty desired I would take some other opportunity of bringing all\n",
      "the rest of his enemy’s ships into his ports.  And so unmeasureable is\n",
      "the ambition of princes, that he seemed to think of nothing less than\n",
      "reducing the whole empire of Blefuscu into a province, and governing it,\n",
      "by a viceroy; of destroying the Big-endian exiles, and compelling that\n",
      "people to break the smaller end of their eggs, by which he would remain\n",
      "the sole monarch of the whole world.  But I endeavoured to divert him\n",
      "from this design, by many arguments drawn from the topics of policy as\n",
      "well as justice; and I plainly protested, “that I would never be an\n",
      "instrument of bringing a free and brave people into slavery.”  And, when\n",
      "the matter was debated in council, the wisest part of the ministry were\n",
      "of my opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "This open bold declaration of mine was so opposite to the schemes and\n",
      "politics of his imperial majesty, that he could never forgive me.  He\n",
      "mentioned it in a very artful manner at council, where I was told that\n",
      "some of the wisest appeared, at least by their silence, to be of my\n",
      "opinion; but others, who were my secret enemies, could not forbear some\n",
      "expressions which, by a side-wind, reflected on me.  And from this time\n",
      "began an intrigue between his majesty and a junto of ministers,\n",
      "maliciously bent against me, which broke out in less than two months, and\n",
      "had like to have ended in my utter destruction.  Of so little weight are\n",
      "the greatest services to princes, when put into the balance with a\n",
      "refusal to gratify their passions.\n",
      "\n",
      "About three weeks after this exploit, there arrived a solemn embassy from\n",
      "Blefuscu, with humble offers of a peace, which was soon concluded, upon\n",
      "conditions very advantageous to our emperor, wherewith I shall not\n",
      "trouble the reader.  There were six ambassadors, with a train of about\n",
      "five hundred persons, and their entry was very magnificent, suitable to\n",
      "the grandeur of their master, and the importance of their business.  When\n",
      "their treaty was finished, wherein I did them several good offices by the\n",
      "credit I now had, or at least appeared to have, at court, their\n",
      "excellencies, who were privately told how much I had been their friend,\n",
      "made me a visit in form.  They began with many compliments upon my valour\n",
      "and generosity, invited me to that kingdom in the emperor their master’s\n",
      "name, and desired me to show them some proofs of my prodigious strength,\n",
      "of which they had heard so many wonders; wherein I readily obliged them,\n",
      "but shall not trouble the reader with the particulars.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I had for some time entertained their excellencies, to their\n",
      "infinite satisfaction and surprise, I desired they would do me the honour\n",
      "to present my most humble respects to the emperor their master, the\n",
      "renown of whose virtues had so justly filled the whole world with\n",
      "admiration, and whose royal person I resolved to attend, before I\n",
      "returned to my own country.  Accordingly, the next time I had the honour\n",
      "to see our emperor, I desired his general license to wait on the\n",
      "Blefuscudian monarch, which he was pleased to grant me, as I could\n",
      "perceive, in a very cold manner; but could not guess the reason, till I\n",
      "had a whisper from a certain person, “that Flimnap and Bolgolam had\n",
      "represented my intercourse with those ambassadors as a mark of\n",
      "disaffection;” from which I am sure my heart was wholly free.  And this\n",
      "was the first time I began to conceive some imperfect idea of courts and\n",
      "ministers.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is to be observed, that these ambassadors spoke to me, by an\n",
      "interpreter, the languages of both empires differing as much from each\n",
      "other as any two in Europe, and each nation priding itself upon the\n",
      "antiquity, beauty, and energy of their own tongue, with an avowed\n",
      "contempt for that of their neighbour; yet our emperor, standing upon the\n",
      "advantage he had got by the seizure of their fleet, obliged them to\n",
      "deliver their credentials, and make their speech, in the Lilliputian\n",
      "tongue.  And it must be confessed, that from the great intercourse of\n",
      "trade and commerce between both realms, from the continual reception of\n",
      "exiles which is mutual among them, and from the custom, in each empire,\n",
      "to send their young nobility and richer gentry to the other, in order to\n",
      "polish themselves by seeing the world, and understanding men and manners;\n",
      "there are few persons of distinction, or merchants, or seamen, who dwell\n",
      "in the maritime parts, but what can hold conversation in both tongues; as\n",
      "I found some weeks after, when I went to pay my respects to the emperor\n",
      "of Blefuscu, which, in the midst of great misfortunes, through the malice\n",
      "of my enemies, proved a very happy adventure to me, as I shall relate in\n",
      "its proper place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reader may remember, that when I signed those articles upon which I\n",
      "recovered my liberty, there were some which I disliked, upon account of\n",
      "their being too servile; neither could anything but an extreme necessity\n",
      "have forced me to submit.  But being now a _nardac_ of the highest rank\n",
      "in that empire, such offices were looked upon as below my dignity, and\n",
      "the emperor (to do him justice), never once mentioned them to me.\n",
      "However, it was not long before I had an opportunity of doing his\n",
      "majesty, at least as I then thought, a most signal service.  I was\n",
      "alarmed at midnight with the cries of many hundred people at my door; by\n",
      "which, being suddenly awaked, I was in some kind of terror.  I heard the\n",
      "word _Burglum_ repeated incessantly: several of the emperor’s court,\n",
      "making their way through the crowd, entreated me to come immediately to\n",
      "the palace, where her imperial majesty’s apartment was on fire, by the\n",
      "carelessness of a maid of honour, who fell asleep while she was reading a\n",
      "romance.  I got up in an instant; and orders being given to clear the way\n",
      "before me, and it being likewise a moonshine night, I made a shift to get\n",
      "to the palace without trampling on any of the people.  I found they had\n",
      "already applied ladders to the walls of the apartment, and were well\n",
      "provided with buckets, but the water was at some distance.  These buckets\n",
      "were about the size of large thimbles, and the poor people supplied me\n",
      "with them as fast as they could: but the flame was so violent that they\n",
      "did little good.  I might easily have stifled it with my coat, which I\n",
      "unfortunately left behind me for haste, and came away only in my leathern\n",
      "jerkin.  The case seemed wholly desperate and deplorable; and this\n",
      "magnificent palace would have infallibly been burnt down to the ground,\n",
      "if, by a presence of mind unusual to me, I had not suddenly thought of an\n",
      "expedient.  I had, the evening before, drunk plentifully of a most\n",
      "delicious wine called _glimigrim_, (the Blefuscudians call it _flunec_,\n",
      "but ours is esteemed the better sort,) which is very diuretic.  By the\n",
      "luckiest chance in the world, I had not discharged myself of any part of\n",
      "it.  The heat I had contracted by coming very near the flames, and by\n",
      "labouring to quench them, made the wine begin to operate by urine; which\n",
      "I voided in such a quantity, and applied so well to the proper places,\n",
      "that in three minutes the fire was wholly extinguished, and the rest of\n",
      "that noble pile, which had cost so many ages in erecting, preserved from\n",
      "destruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now day-light, and I returned to my house without waiting to\n",
      "congratulate with the emperor: because, although I had done a very\n",
      "eminent piece of service, yet I could not tell how his majesty might\n",
      "resent the manner by which I had performed it: for, by the fundamental\n",
      "laws of the realm, it is capital in any person, of what quality soever,\n",
      "to make water within the precincts of the palace.  But I was a little\n",
      "comforted by a message from his majesty, “that he would give orders to\n",

      "residence of nine months, and thirteen days.  Having a head mechanically\n",
      "turned, and being likewise forced by necessity, I had made for myself a\n",
      "table and chair convenient enough, out of the largest trees in the royal\n",
      "park.  Two hundred sempstresses were employed to make me shirts, and\n",
      "linen for my bed and table, all of the strongest and coarsest kind they\n",
      "could get; which, however, they were forced to quilt together in several\n",
      "folds, for the thickest was some degrees finer than lawn.  Their linen is\n",
      "usually three inches wide, and three feet make a piece.  The sempstresses\n",
      "took my measure as I lay on the ground, one standing at my neck, and\n",
      "another at my mid-leg, with a strong cord extended, that each held by the\n",
      "end, while a third measured the length of the cord with a rule of an inch\n",
      "long.  Then they measured my right thumb, and desired no more; for by a\n",
      "mathematical computation, that twice round the thumb is once round the\n",
      "wrist, and so on to the neck and the waist, and by the help of my old\n",
      "shirt, which I displayed on the ground before them for a pattern, they\n",
      "fitted me exactly.  Three hundred tailors were employed in the same\n",
      "manner to make me clothes; but they had another contrivance for taking my\n",
      "measure.  I kneeled down, and they raised a ladder from the ground to my\n",
      "neck; upon this ladder one of them mounted, and let fall a plumb-line\n",
      "from my collar to the floor, which just answered the length of my coat:\n",
      "but my waist and arms I measured myself.  When my clothes were finished,\n",
      "which was done in my house (for the largest of theirs would not have been\n",
      "able to hold them), they looked like the patch-work made by the ladies in\n",

      "them on the table: a hundred more attended below on the ground, some with\n",
      "dishes of meat, and some with barrels of wine and other liquors slung on\n",
      "their shoulders; all which the waiters above drew up, as I wanted, in a\n",
      "very ingenious manner, by certain cords, as we draw the bucket up a well\n",
      "in Europe.  A dish of their meat was a good mouthful, and a barrel of\n",
      "their liquor a reasonable draught.  Their mutton yields to ours, but\n",
      "their beef is excellent.  I have had a sirloin so large, that I have been\n",

      "master.  That minister had always been my secret enemy, though he\n",

      "be jealous of his wife, from the malice of some evil tongues, who\n",
      "informed him that her grace had taken a violent affection for my person;\n",
      "and the court scandal ran for some time, that she once came privately to\n",

      "without any grounds, further than that her grace was pleased to treat me\n",
      "with all innocent marks of freedom and friendship.  I own she came often\n",
      "to my house, but always publicly, nor ever without three more in the\n",
      "coach, who were usually her sister and young daughter, and some\n",
      "particular acquaintance; but this was common to many other ladies of the\n",
      "court.  And I still appeal to my servants round, whether they at any time\n",
      "saw a coach at my door, without knowing what persons were in it.  On\n",
      "those occasions, when a servant had given me notice, my custom was to go\n",
      "immediately to the door, and, after paying my respects, to take up the\n",
      "coach and two horses very carefully in my hands (for, if there were six\n",
      "horses, the postillion always unharnessed four,) and place them on a\n",
      "table, where I had fixed a movable rim quite round, of five inches high,\n",
      "to prevent accidents.  And I have often had four coaches and horses at\n",
      "once on my table, full of company, while I sat in my chair, leaning my\n",
      "face towards them; and when I was engaged with one set, the coachmen\n",
      "would gently drive the others round my table.  I have passed many an\n",
      "afternoon very agreeably in these conversations.  But I defy the\n",
      "treasurer, or his two informers (I will name them, and let them make the\n",
      "best of it) Clustril and Drunlo, to prove that any person ever came to me\n",
      "_incognito_, except the secretary Reldresal, who was sent by express\n",
      "command of his imperial majesty, as I have before related.  I should not\n",

      "wherein the reputation of a great lady is so nearly concerned, to say\n",

      "flesh from your bones, take it away by cart-loads, and bury it in distant\n",

      "admiral, who, being a creature of the empress, was perpetually instigated\n",
      "by her majesty to insist upon your death, she having borne perpetual\n",

      "It was a custom introduced by this prince and his ministry (very\n",
      "different, as I have been assured, from the practice of former times,)\n",
      "that after the court had decreed any cruel execution, either to gratify\n",
      "the monarch’s resentment, or the malice of a favourite, the emperor\n",
      "always made a speech to his whole council, expressing his great lenity\n",
      "and tenderness, as qualities known and confessed by all the world.  This\n",
      "speech was immediately published throughout the kingdom; nor did any\n",
      "thing terrify the people so much as those encomiums on his majesty’s\n",
      "mercy; because it was observed, that the more these praises were enlarged\n",
      "and insisted on, the more inhuman was the punishment, and the sufferer\n",
      "more innocent.  Yet, as to myself, I must confess, having never been\n",
      "designed for a courtier, either by my birth or education, I was so ill a\n",
      "judge of things, that I could not discover the lenity and favour of this\n",
      "sentence, but conceived it (perhaps erroneously) rather to be rigorous\n",
      "than gentle.  I sometimes thought of standing my trial, for, although I\n",
      "could not deny the facts alleged in the several articles, yet I hoped\n",
      "they would admit of some extenuation.  But having in my life perused many\n",
      "state-trials, which I ever observed to terminate as the judges thought\n",
      "fit to direct, I durst not rely on so dangerous a decision, in so\n",
      "critical a juncture, and against such powerful enemies.  Once I was\n",
      "strongly bent upon resistance, for, while I had liberty the whole\n",
      "strength of that empire could hardly subdue me, and I might easily with\n",
      "stones pelt the metropolis to pieces; but I soon rejected that project\n",
      "with horror, by remembering the oath I had made to the emperor, the\n",
      "favours I received from him, and the high title of _nardac_ he conferred\n",
      "upon me.  Neither had I so soon learned the gratitude of courtiers, to\n",
      "persuade myself, that his majesty’s present seventies acquitted me of all\n",
      "past obligations.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, I fixed upon a resolution, for which it is probable I may incur\n",
      "some censure, and not unjustly; for I confess I owe the preserving of\n",
      "mine eyes, and consequently my liberty, to my own great rashness and want\n",
      "of experience; because, if I had then known the nature of princes and\n",
      "ministers, which I have since observed in many other courts, and their\n",
      "methods of treating criminals less obnoxious than myself, I should, with\n",
      "great alacrity and readiness, have submitted to so easy a punishment.\n",
      "But hurried on by the precipitancy of youth, and having his imperial\n",
      "majesty’s license to pay my attendance upon the emperor of Blefuscu, I\n",
      "took this opportunity, before the three days were elapsed, to send a\n",
      "letter to my friend the secretary, signifying my resolution of setting\n",
      "out that morning for Blefuscu, pursuant to the leave I had got; and,\n",
      "without waiting for an answer, I went to that side of the island where\n",
      "our fleet lay.  I seized a large man of war, tied a cable to the prow,\n",
      "and, lifting up the anchors, I stripped myself, put my clothes (together\n",
      "with my coverlet, which I carried under my arm) into the vessel, and,\n",
      "drawing it after me, between wading and swimming arrived at the royal\n",
      "port of Blefuscu, where the people had long expected me: they lent me two\n",
      "guides to direct me to the capital city, which is of the same name.  I\n",
      "held them in my hands, till I came within two hundred yards of the gate,\n",
      "and desired them “to signify my arrival to one of the secretaries, and\n",

      "about an hour, “that his majesty, attended by the royal family, and great\n",
      "officers of the court, was coming out to receive me.”  I advanced a\n",
      "hundred yards.  The emperor and his train alighted from their horses, the\n",
      "empress and ladies from their coaches, and I did not perceive they were\n",
      "in any fright or concern.  I lay on the ground to kiss his majesty’s and\n",
      "the empress’s hands.  I told his majesty, “that I was come according to\n",
      "my promise, and with the license of the emperor my master, to have the\n",
      "honour of seeing so mighty a monarch, and to offer him any service in my\n",
      "power, consistent with my duty to my own prince;” not mentioning a word\n",
      "of my disgrace, because I had hitherto no regular information of it, and\n",
      "might suppose myself wholly ignorant of any such design; neither could I\n",
      "reasonably conceive that the emperor would discover the secret, while I\n",

      "after some difficulties, returns safe to his native country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three days after my arrival, walking out of curiosity to the north-east\n",
      "coast of the island, I observed, about half a league off in the sea,\n",
      "somewhat that looked like a boat overturned.  I pulled off my shoes and\n",
      "stockings, and, wailing two or three hundred yards, I found the object to\n",
      "approach nearer by force of the tide; and then plainly saw it to be a\n",
      "real boat, which I supposed might by some tempest have been driven from a\n",
      "ship.  Whereupon, I returned immediately towards the city, and desired\n",
      "his imperial majesty to lend me twenty of the tallest vessels he had\n",
      "left, after the loss of his fleet, and three thousand seamen, under the\n",
      "command of his vice-admiral.  This fleet sailed round, while I went back\n",
      "the shortest way to the coast, where I first discovered the boat.  I\n",
      "found the tide had driven it still nearer.  The seamen were all provided\n",
      "with cordage, which I had beforehand twisted to a sufficient strength.\n",
      "When the ships came up, I stripped myself, and waded till I came within a\n",
      "hundred yards off the boat, after which I was forced to swim till I got\n",
      "up to it.  The seamen threw me the end of the cord, which I fastened to a\n",
      "hole in the fore-part of the boat, and the other end to a man of war; but\n",
      "I found all my labour to little purpose; for, being out of my depth, I\n",
      "was not able to work.  In this necessity I was forced to swim behind, and\n",
      "push the boat forward, as often as I could, with one of my hands; and the\n",
      "tide favouring me, I advanced so far that I could just hold up my chin\n",
      "and feel the ground.  I rested two or three minutes, and then gave the\n",
      "boat another shove, and so on, till the sea was no higher than my\n",
      "arm-pits; and now, the most laborious part being over, I took out my\n",
      "other cables, which were stowed in one of the ships, and fastened them\n",
      "first to the boat, and then to nine of the vessels which attended me; the\n",
      "wind being favourable, the seamen towed, and I shoved, until we arrived\n",
      "within forty yards of the shore; and, waiting till the tide was out, I\n",
      "got dry to the boat, and by the assistance of two thousand men, with\n",
      "ropes and engines, I made a shift to turn it on its bottom, and found it\n",
      "was but little damaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall not trouble the reader with the difficulties I was under, by the\n",
      "help of certain paddles, which cost me ten days making, to get my boat to\n",
      "the royal port of Blefuscu, where a mighty concourse of people appeared\n",
      "upon my arrival, full of wonder at the sight of so prodigious a vessel.\n",
      "I told the emperor “that my good fortune had thrown this boat in my way,\n",
      "to carry me to some place whence I might return into my native country;\n",
      "and begged his majesty’s orders for getting materials to fit it up,\n",
      "together with his license to depart;” which, after some kind\n",
      "expostulations, he was pleased to grant.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did very much wonder, in all this time, not to have heard of any\n",
      "express relating to me from our emperor to the court of Blefuscu.  But I\n",
      "was afterward given privately to understand, that his imperial majesty,\n",
      "never imagining I had the least notice of his designs, believed I was\n",
      "only gone to Blefuscu in performance of my promise, according to the\n",
      "license he had given me, which was well known at our court, and would\n",
      "return in a few days, when the ceremony was ended.  But he was at last in\n",
      "pain at my long absence; and after consulting with the treasurer and the\n",
      "rest of that cabal, a person of quality was dispatched with the copy of\n",
      "the articles against me.  This envoy had instructions to represent to the\n",
      "monarch of Blefuscu, “the great lenity of his master, who was content to\n",
      "punish me no farther than with the loss of mine eyes; that I had fled\n",
      "from justice; and if I did not return in two hours, I should be deprived\n",
      "of my title of _nardac_, and declared a traitor.”  The envoy further\n",
      "added, “that in order to maintain the peace and amity between both\n",
      "empires, his master expected that his brother of Blefuscu would give\n",
      "orders to have me sent back to Lilliput, bound hand and foot, to be\n",
      "punished as a traitor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The emperor of Blefuscu, having taken three days to consult, returned an\n",
      "answer consisting of many civilities and excuses.  He said, “that as for\n",
      "sending me bound, his brother knew it was impossible; that, although I\n",
      "had deprived him of his fleet, yet he owed great obligations to me for\n",
      "many good offices I had done him in making the peace.  That, however,\n",
      "both their majesties would soon be made easy; for I had found a\n",
      "prodigious vessel on the shore, able to carry me on the sea, which he had\n",
      "given orders to fit up, with my own assistance and direction; and he\n",
      "hoped, in a few weeks, both empires would be freed from so insupportable\n",
      "an encumbrance.”\n",

      "With this answer the envoy returned to Lilliput; and the monarch of\n",
      "Blefuscu related to me all that had passed; offering me at the same time\n",
      "(but under the strictest confidence) his gracious protection, if I would\n",
      "continue in his service; wherein, although I believed him sincere, yet I\n",
      "resolved never more to put any confidence in princes or ministers, where\n",
      "I could possibly avoid it; and therefore, with all due acknowledgments\n",
      "for his favourable intentions, I humbly begged to be excused.  I told\n",
      "him, “that since fortune, whether good or evil, had thrown a vessel in my\n",
      "way, I was resolved to venture myself on the ocean, rather than be an\n",
      "occasion of difference between two such mighty monarchs.”  Neither did I\n",
      "find the emperor at all displeased; and I discovered, by a certain\n",
      "accident, that he was very glad of my resolution, and so were most of his\n",
      "ministers.\n",
      "\n",
      "These considerations moved me to hasten my departure somewhat sooner than\n",
      "I intended; to which the court, impatient to have me gone, very readily\n",
      "contributed.  Five hundred workmen were employed to make two sails to my\n",
      "boat, according to my directions, by quilting thirteen folds of their\n",
      "strongest linen together.  I was at the pains of making ropes and cables,\n",
      "by twisting ten, twenty, or thirty of the thickest and strongest of\n",
      "theirs.  A great stone that I happened to find, after a long search, by\n",
      "the sea-shore, served me for an anchor.  I had the tallow of three\n",
      "hundred cows, for greasing my boat, and other uses.  I was at incredible\n",
      "pains in cutting down some of the largest timber-trees, for oars and\n",
      "masts, wherein I was, however, much assisted by his majesty’s\n",
      "ship-carpenters, who helped me in smoothing them, after I had done the\n",
      "rough work.\n",
      "\n",
      "In about a month, when all was prepared, I sent to receive his majesty’s\n",
      "commands, and to take my leave.  The emperor and royal family came out of\n",
      "the palace; I lay down on my face to kiss his hand, which he very\n",
      "graciously gave me: so did the empress and young princes of the blood.\n",
      "His majesty presented me with fifty purses of two hundred _sprugs_\n",
      "a-piece, together with his picture at full length, which I put\n",
      "immediately into one of my gloves, to keep it from being hurt.  The\n",
      "ceremonies at my departure were too many to trouble the reader with at\n",
      "this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I stored the boat with the carcases of a hundred oxen, and three hundred\n",
      "sheep, with bread and drink proportionable, and as much meat ready\n",
      "dressed as four hundred cooks could provide.  I took with me six cows and\n",
      "two bulls alive, with as many ewes and rams, intending to carry them into\n",
      "my own country, and propagate the breed.  And to feed them on board, I\n",
      "had a good bundle of hay, and a bag of corn.  I would gladly have taken a\n",
      "dozen of the natives, but this was a thing the emperor would by no means\n",
      "permit; and, besides a diligent search into my pockets, his majesty\n",
      "engaged my honour “not to carry away any of his subjects, although with\n",
      "their own consent and desire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Having thus prepared all things as well as I was able, I set sail on the\n",
      "twenty-fourth day of September 1701, at six in the morning; and when I\n",
      "had gone about four-leagues to the northward, the wind being at\n",
      "south-east, at six in the evening I descried a small island, about half a\n",
      "league to the north-west.  I advanced forward, and cast anchor on the\n",
      "lee-side of the island, which seemed to be uninhabited.  I then took some\n",
      "refreshment, and went to my rest.  I slept well, and as I conjectured at\n",
      "least six hours, for I found the day broke in two hours after I awaked.\n",
      "It was a clear night.  I ate my breakfast before the sun was up; and\n",
      "heaving anchor, the wind being favourable, I steered the same course that\n",
      "I had done the day before, wherein I was directed by my pocket compass.\n",
      "My intention was to reach, if possible, one of those islands which I had\n",
      "reason to believe lay to the north-east of Van Diemen’s Land.  I\n",
      "discovered nothing all that day; but upon the next, about three in the\n",
      "afternoon, when I had by my computation made twenty-four leagues from\n",
      "Blefuscu, I descried a sail steering to the south-east; my course was due\n",
      "east.  I hailed her, but could get no answer; yet I found I gained upon\n",
      "her, for the wind slackened.  I made all the sail I could, and in half an\n",
      "hour she spied me, then hung out her ancient, and discharged a gun.  It\n",
      "is not easy to express the joy I was in, upon the unexpected hope of once\n",
      "more seeing my beloved country, and the dear pledges I left in it.  The\n",
      "ship slackened her sails, and I came up with her between five and six in\n",
      "the evening, September 26th; but my heart leaped within me to see her\n",
      "English colours.  I put my cows and sheep into my coat-pockets, and got\n",
      "on board with all my little cargo of provisions.  The vessel was an\n",
      "English merchantman, returning from Japan by the North and South seas;\n",
      "the captain, Mr. John Biddel, of Deptford, a very civil man, and an\n",
      "excellent sailor.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were now in the latitude of 30 degrees south; there were about fifty\n",
      "men in the ship; and here I met an old comrade of mine, one Peter\n",
      "Williams, who gave me a good character to the captain.  This gentleman\n",
      "treated me with kindness, and desired I would let him know what place I\n",
      "came from last, and whither I was bound; which I did in a few words, but\n",
      "he thought I was raving, and that the dangers I underwent had disturbed\n",
      "my head; whereupon I took my black cattle and sheep out of my pocket,\n",
      "which, after great astonishment, clearly convinced him of my veracity.  I\n",
      "then showed him the gold given me by the emperor of Blefuscu, together\n",
      "with his majesty’s picture at full length, and some other rarities of\n",
      "that country.  I gave him two purses of two hundreds _sprugs_ each, and\n",
      "promised, when we arrived in England, to make him a present of a cow and\n",
      "a sheep big with young.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall not trouble the reader with a particular account of this voyage,\n",
      "which was very prosperous for the most part.  We arrived in the Downs on\n",
      "the 13th of April, 1702.  I had only one misfortune, that the rats on\n",
      "board carried away one of my sheep; I found her bones in a hole, picked\n",
      "clean from the flesh.  The rest of my cattle I got safe ashore, and set\n",
      "them a-grazing in a bowling-green at Greenwich, where the fineness of the\n",
      "grass made them feed very heartily, though I had always feared the\n",
      "contrary: neither could I possibly have preserved them in so long a\n",
      "voyage, if the captain had not allowed me some of his best biscuit,\n",
      "which, rubbed to powder, and mingled with water, was their constant food.\n",
      "The short time I continued in England, I made a considerable profit by\n",
      "showing my cattle to many persons of quality and others: and before I\n",
      "began my second voyage, I sold them for six hundred pounds.  Since my\n",
      "last return I find the breed is considerably increased, especially the\n",
      "sheep, which I hope will prove much to the advantage of the woollen\n",
      "manufacture, by the fineness of the fleeces.\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed but two months with my wife and family, for my insatiable desire\n",
      "of seeing foreign countries, would suffer me to continue no longer.  I\n",
      "left fifteen hundred pounds with my wife, and fixed her in a good house\n",
      "at Redriff.  My remaining stock I carried with me, part in money and part\n",
      "in goods, in hopes to improve my fortunes.  My eldest uncle John had left\n",
      "me an estate in land, near Epping, of about thirty pounds a-year; and I\n",
      "had a long lease of the Black Bull in Fetter-Lane, which yielded me as\n",
      "much more; so that I was not in any danger of leaving my family upon the\n",
      "parish.  My son Johnny, named so after his uncle, was at the\n",
      "grammar-school, and a towardly child.  My daughter Betty (who is now well\n",
      "married, and has children) was then at her needle-work.  I took leave of\n",
      "my wife, and boy and girl, with tears on both sides, and went on board\n",
      "the Adventure, a merchant ship of three hundred tons, bound for Surat,\n",

      "Adventure, Captain John Nicholas, a Cornish man, commander, bound for\n",
      "Surat.  We had a very prosperous gale, till we arrived at the Cape of\n",
      "Good Hope, where we landed for fresh water; but discovering a leak, we\n",
      "unshipped our goods and wintered there; for the captain falling sick of\n",
      "an ague, we could not leave the Cape till the end of March.  We then set\n",
      "sail, and had a good voyage till we passed the Straits of Madagascar; but\n",
      "having got northward of that island, and to about five degrees south\n",
      "latitude, the winds, which in those seas are observed to blow a constant\n",
      "equal gale between the north and west, from the beginning of December to\n",
      "the beginning of May, on the 19th of April began to blow with much\n",
      "greater violence, and more westerly than usual, continuing so for twenty\n",
      "days together: during which time, we were driven a little to the east of\n",
      "the Molucca Islands, and about three degrees northward of the line, as\n",
      "our captain found by an observation he took the 2nd of May, at which time\n",
      "the wind ceased, and it was a perfect calm, whereat I was not a little\n",
      "rejoiced.  But he, being a man well experienced in the navigation of\n",
      "those seas, bid us all prepare against a storm, which accordingly\n",
      "happened the day following: for the southern wind, called the southern\n",
      "monsoon, began to set in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finding it was likely to overblow, we took in our sprit-sail, and stood\n",
      "by to hand the fore-sail; but making foul weather, we looked the guns\n",
      "were all fast, and handed the mizen.  The ship lay very broad off, so we\n",
      "thought it better spooning before the sea, than trying or hulling.  We\n",
      "reefed the fore-sail and set him, and hauled aft the fore-sheet; the helm\n",
      "was hard a-weather.  The ship wore bravely.  We belayed the fore\n",
      "down-haul; but the sail was split, and we hauled down the yard, and got\n",
      "the sail into the ship, and unbound all the things clear of it.  It was a\n",
      "very fierce storm; the sea broke strange and dangerous.  We hauled off\n",
      "upon the laniard of the whip-staff, and helped the man at the helm.  We\n",
      "would not get down our topmast, but let all stand, because she scudded\n",
      "before the sea very well, and we knew that the top-mast being aloft, the\n",
      "ship was the wholesomer, and made better way through the sea, seeing we\n",
      "had sea-room.  When the storm was over, we set fore-sail and main-sail,\n",
      "and brought the ship to.  Then we set the mizen, main-top-sail, and the\n",
      "fore-top-sail.  Our course was east-north-east, the wind was at\n",
      "south-west.  We got the starboard tacks aboard, we cast off our\n",
      "weather-braces and lifts; we set in the lee-braces, and hauled forward by\n",
      "the weather-bowlings, and hauled them tight, and belayed them, and hauled\n",
      "over the mizen tack to windward, and kept her full and by as near as she\n",
      "would lie.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this storm, which was followed by a strong wind west-south-west,\n",
      "we were carried, by my computation, about five hundred leagues to the\n",
      "east, so that the oldest sailor on board could not tell in what part of\n",
      "the world we were.  Our provisions held out well, our ship was staunch,\n",
      "and our crew all in good health; but we lay in the utmost distress for\n",
      "water.  We thought it best to hold on the same course, rather than turn\n",
      "more northerly, which might have brought us to the north-west part of\n",
      "Great Tartary, and into the Frozen Sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the 16th day of June, 1703, a boy on the top-mast discovered land.  On\n",
      "the 17th, we came in full view of a great island, or continent (for we\n",
      "knew not whether;) on the south side whereof was a small neck of land\n",
      "jutting out into the sea, and a creek too shallow to hold a ship of above\n",
      "one hundred tons.  We cast anchor within a league of this creek, and our\n",
      "captain sent a dozen of his men well armed in the long-boat, with vessels\n",
      "for water, if any could be found.  I desired his leave to go with them,\n",
      "that I might see the country, and make what discoveries I could.  When we\n",
      "came to land we saw no river or spring, nor any sign of inhabitants.  Our\n",
      "men therefore wandered on the shore to find out some fresh water near the\n",
      "sea, and I walked alone about a mile on the other side, where I observed\n",
      "the country all barren and rocky.  I now began to be weary, and seeing\n",
      "nothing to entertain my curiosity, I returned gently down towards the\n",
      "creek; and the sea being full in my view, I saw our men already got into\n",
      "the boat, and rowing for life to the ship.  I was going to holla after\n",
      "them, although it had been to little purpose, when I observed a huge\n",
      "creature walking after them in the sea, as fast as he could: he waded not\n",
      "much deeper than his knees, and took prodigious strides: but our men had\n",
      "the start of him half a league, and, the sea thereabouts being full of\n",
      "sharp-pointed rocks, the monster was not able to overtake the boat.  This\n",
      "I was afterwards told, for I durst not stay to see the issue of the\n",
      "adventure; but ran as fast as I could the way I first went, and then\n",
      "climbed up a steep hill, which gave me some prospect of the country.  I\n",
      "found it fully cultivated; but that which first surprised me was the\n",
      "length of the grass, which, in those grounds that seemed to be kept for\n",
      "hay, was about twenty feet high.\n",
      "\n",
      "I fell into a high road, for so I took it to be, though it served to the\n",
      "inhabitants only as a foot-path through a field of barley.  Here I walked\n",
      "on for some time, but could see little on either side, it being now near\n",
      "harvest, and the corn rising at least forty feet.  I was an hour walking\n",
      "to the end of this field, which was fenced in with a hedge of at least\n",
      "one hundred and twenty feet high, and the trees so lofty that I could\n",
      "make no computation of their altitude.  There was a stile to pass from\n",
      "this field into the next.  It had four steps, and a stone to cross over\n",
      "when you came to the uppermost.  It was impossible for me to climb this\n",
      "stile, because every step was six-feet high, and the upper stone about\n",
      "twenty.  I was endeavouring to find some gap in the hedge, when I\n",
      "discovered one of the inhabitants in the next field, advancing towards\n",
      "the stile, of the same size with him whom I saw in the sea pursuing our\n",
      "boat.  He appeared as tall as an ordinary spire steeple, and took about\n",
      "ten yards at every stride, as near as I could guess.  I was struck with\n",
      "the utmost fear and astonishment, and ran to hide myself in the corn,\n",
      "whence I saw him at the top of the stile looking back into the next field\n",
      "on the right hand, and heard him call in a voice many degrees louder than\n",
      "a speaking-trumpet: but the noise was so high in the air, that at first I\n",
      "certainly thought it was thunder.  Whereupon seven monsters, like\n",
      "himself, came towards him with reaping-hooks in their hands, each hook\n",
      "about the largeness of six scythes.  These people were not so well clad\n",
      "as the first, whose servants or labourers they seemed to be; for, upon\n",
      "some words he spoke, they went to reap the corn in the field where I lay.\n",
      "I kept from them at as great a distance as I could, but was forced to\n",
      "move with extreme difficulty, for the stalks of the corn were sometimes\n",
      "not above a foot distant, so that I could hardly squeeze my body betwixt\n",
      "them.  However, I made a shift to go forward, till I came to a part of\n",
      "the field where the corn had been laid by the rain and wind.  Here it was\n",
      "impossible for me to advance a step; for the stalks were so interwoven,\n",
      "that I could not creep through, and the beards of the fallen ears so\n",
      "strong and pointed, that they pierced through my clothes into my flesh.\n",
      "At the same time I heard the reapers not a hundred yards behind me.\n",
      "Being quite dispirited with toil, and wholly overcome by grief and\n",
      "dispair, I lay down between two ridges, and heartily wished I might there\n",
      "end my days.  I bemoaned my desolate widow and fatherless children.  I\n",
      "lamented my own folly and wilfulness, in attempting a second voyage,\n",
      "against the advice of all my friends and relations.  In this terrible\n",
      "agitation of mind, I could not forbear thinking of Lilliput, whose\n",
      "inhabitants looked upon me as the greatest prodigy that ever appeared in\n",
      "the world; where I was able to draw an imperial fleet in my hand, and\n",
      "perform those other actions, which will be recorded for ever in the\n",
      "chronicles of that empire, while posterity shall hardly believe them,\n",
      "although attested by millions.  I reflected what a mortification it must\n",
      "prove to me, to appear as inconsiderable in this nation, as one single\n",
      "Lilliputian would be among us.  But this I conceived was to be the least\n",
      "of my misfortunes; for, as human creatures are observed to be more savage\n",
      "and cruel in proportion to their bulk, what could I expect but to be a\n",
      "morsel in the mouth of the first among these enormous barbarians that\n",
      "should happen to seize me?  Undoubtedly philosophers are in the right,\n",
      "when they tell us that nothing is great or little otherwise than by\n",
      "comparison.  It might have pleased fortune, to have let the Lilliputians\n",
      "find some nation, where the people were as diminutive with respect to\n",
      "them, as they were to me.  And who knows but that even this prodigious\n",
      "race of mortals might be equally overmatched in some distant part of the\n",
      "world, whereof we have yet no discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scared and confounded as I was, I could not forbear going on with these\n",
      "reflections, when one of the reapers, approaching within ten yards of the\n",
      "ridge where I lay, made me apprehend that with the next step I should be\n",
      "squashed to death under his foot, or cut in two with his reaping-hook.\n",
      "And therefore, when he was again about to move, I screamed as loud as\n",
      "fear could make me: whereupon the huge creature trod short, and, looking\n",
      "round about under him for some time, at last espied me as I lay on the\n",
      "ground.  He considered awhile, with the caution of one who endeavours to\n",
      "lay hold on a small dangerous animal in such a manner that it shall not\n",
      "be able either to scratch or bite him, as I myself have sometimes done\n",
      "with a weasel in England.  At length he ventured to take me behind, by\n",
      "the middle, between his fore-finger and thumb, and brought me within\n",
      "three yards of his eyes, that he might behold my shape more perfectly.  I\n",
      "guessed his meaning, and my good fortune gave me so much presence of\n",
      "mind, that I resolved not to struggle in the least as he held me in the\n",
      "air above sixty feet from the ground, although he grievously pinched my\n",
      "sides, for fear I should slip through his fingers.  All I ventured was to\n",
      "raise mine eyes towards the sun, and place my hands together in a\n",
      "supplicating posture, and to speak some words in a humble melancholy\n",
      "tone, suitable to the condition I then was in: for I apprehended every\n",
      "moment that he would dash me against the ground, as we usually do any\n",
      "little hateful animal, which we have a mind to destroy.  But my good star\n",
      "would have it, that he appeared pleased with my voice and gestures, and\n",
      "began to look upon me as a curiosity, much wondering to hear me pronounce\n",
      "articulate words, although he could not understand them.  In the mean\n",
      "time I was not able to forbear groaning and shedding tears, and turning\n",
      "my head towards my sides; letting him know, as well as I could, how\n",
      "cruelly I was hurt by the pressure of his thumb and finger.  He seemed to\n",
      "apprehend my meaning; for, lifting up the lappet of his coat, he put me\n",
      "gently into it, and immediately ran along with me to his master, who was\n",
      "a substantial farmer, and the same person I had first seen in the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "The farmer having (as I suppose by their talk) received such an account\n",
      "of me as his servant could give him, took a piece of a small straw, about\n",
      "the size of a walking-staff, and therewith lifted up the lappets of my\n",
      "coat; which it seems he thought to be some kind of covering that nature\n",
      "had given me.  He blew my hairs aside to take a better view of my face.\n",
      "He called his hinds about him, and asked them, as I afterwards learned,\n",
      "whether they had ever seen in the fields any little creature that\n",
      "resembled me.  He then placed me softly on the ground upon all fours, but\n",
      "I got immediately up, and walked slowly backward and forward, to let\n",
      "those people see I had no intent to run away.  They all sat down in a\n",
      "circle about me, the better to observe my motions.  I pulled off my hat,\n",
      "and made a low bow towards the farmer.  I fell on my knees, and lifted up\n",
      "my hands and eyes, and spoke several words as loud as I could: I took a\n",
      "purse of gold out of my pocket, and humbly presented it to him.  He\n",
      "received it on the palm of his hand, then applied it close to his eye to\n",
      "see what it was, and afterwards turned it several times with the point of\n",
      "a pin (which he took out of his sleeve,) but could make nothing of it.\n",
      "Whereupon I made a sign that he should place his hand on the ground.  I\n",
      "then took the purse, and, opening it, poured all the gold into his palm.\n",
      "There were six Spanish pieces of four pistoles each, beside twenty or\n",
      "thirty smaller coins.  I saw him wet the tip of his little finger upon\n",
      "his tongue, and take up one of my largest pieces, and then another; but\n",
      "he seemed to be wholly ignorant what they were.  He made me a sign to put\n",
      "them again into my purse, and the purse again into my pocket, which,\n",
      "after offering it to him several times, I thought it best to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "The farmer, by this time, was convinced I must be a rational creature.\n",
      "He spoke often to me; but the sound of his voice pierced my ears like\n",
      "that of a water-mill, yet his words were articulate enough.  I answered\n",
      "as loud as I could in several languages, and he often laid his ear within\n",
      "two yards of me: but all in vain, for we were wholly unintelligible to\n",
      "each other.  He then sent his servants to their work, and taking his\n",
      "handkerchief out of his pocket, he doubled and spread it on his left\n",
      "hand, which he placed flat on the ground with the palm upward, making me\n",
      "a sign to step into it, as I could easily do, for it was not above a foot\n",
      "in thickness.  I thought it my part to obey, and, for fear of falling,\n",
      "laid myself at full length upon the handkerchief, with the remainder of\n",
      "which he lapped me up to the head for further security, and in this\n",
      "manner carried me home to his house.  There he called his wife, and\n",
      "showed me to her; but she screamed and ran back, as women in England do\n",
      "at the sight of a toad or a spider.  However, when she had a while seen\n",
      "my behaviour, and how well I observed the signs her husband made, she was\n",
      "soon reconciled, and by degrees grew extremely tender of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was about twelve at noon, and a servant brought in dinner.  It was\n",
      "only one substantial dish of meat (fit for the plain condition of a\n",
      "husbandman,) in a dish of about four-and-twenty feet diameter.  The\n",
      "company were, the farmer and his wife, three children, and an old\n",
      "grandmother.  When they were sat down, the farmer placed me at some\n",
      "distance from him on the table, which was thirty feet high from the\n",
      "floor.  I was in a terrible fright, and kept as far as I could from the\n",
      "edge, for fear of falling.  The wife minced a bit of meat, then crumbled\n",
      "some bread on a trencher, and placed it before me.  I made her a low bow,\n",
      "took out my knife and fork, and fell to eat, which gave them exceeding\n",
      "delight.  The mistress sent her maid for a small dram cup, which held\n",
      "about two gallons, and filled it with drink; I took up the vessel with\n",
      "much difficulty in both hands, and in a most respectful manner drank to\n",
      "her ladyship’s health, expressing the words as loud as I could in\n",
      "English, which made the company laugh so heartily, that I was almost\n",
      "deafened with the noise.  This liquor tasted like a small cider, and was\n",
      "not unpleasant.  Then the master made me a sign to come to his trencher\n",
      "side; but as I walked on the table, being in great surprise all the time,\n",
      "as the indulgent reader will easily conceive and excuse, I happened to\n",
      "stumble against a crust, and fell flat on my face, but received no hurt.\n",
      "I got up immediately, and observing the good people to be in much\n",
      "concern, I took my hat (which I held under my arm out of good manners,)\n",
      "and waving it over my head, made three huzzas, to show I had got no\n",
      "mischief by my fall.  But advancing forward towards my master (as I shall\n",
      "henceforth call him,) his youngest son, who sat next to him, an arch boy\n",
      "of about ten years old, took me up by the legs, and held me so high in\n",
      "the air, that I trembled every limb: but his father snatched me from him,\n",
      "and at the same time gave him such a box on the left ear, as would have\n",
      "felled an European troop of horse to the earth, ordering him to be taken\n",
      "from the table.  But being afraid the boy might owe me a spite, and well\n",
      "remembering how mischievous all children among us naturally are to\n",
      "sparrows, rabbits, young kittens, and puppy dogs, I fell on my knees, and\n",
      "pointing to the boy, made my master to understand, as well as I could,\n",
      "that I desired his son might be pardoned.  The father complied, and the\n",
      "lad took his seat again, whereupon I went to him, and kissed his hand,\n",
      "which my master took, and made him stroke me gently with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the midst of dinner, my mistress’s favourite cat leaped into her lap.\n",
      "I heard a noise behind me like that of a dozen stocking-weavers at work;\n",
      "and turning my head, I found it proceeded from the purring of that\n",
      "animal, who seemed to be three times larger than an ox, as I computed by\n",
      "the view of her head, and one of her paws, while her mistress was feeding\n",
      "and stroking her.  The fierceness of this creature’s countenance\n",
      "altogether discomposed me; though I stood at the farther end of the\n",
      "table, above fifty feet off; and although my mistress held her fast, for\n",
      "fear she might give a spring, and seize me in her talons.  But it\n",
      "happened there was no danger, for the cat took not the least notice of me\n",
      "when my master placed me within three yards of her.  And as I have been\n",
      "always told, and found true by experience in my travels, that flying or\n",
      "discovering fear before a fierce animal, is a certain way to make it\n",
      "pursue or attack you, so I resolved, in this dangerous juncture, to show\n",
      "no manner of concern.  I walked with intrepidity five or six times before\n",
      "the very head of the cat, and came within half a yard of her; whereupon\n",
      "she drew herself back, as if she were more afraid of me: I had less\n",
      "apprehension concerning the dogs, whereof three or four came into the\n",
      "room, as it is usual in farmers’ houses; one of which was a mastiff,\n",
      "equal in bulk to four elephants, and another a greyhound, somewhat taller\n",
      "than the mastiff, but not so large.\n",
      "\n",
      "When dinner was almost done, the nurse came in with a child of a year old\n",
      "in her arms, who immediately spied me, and began a squall that you might\n",
      "have heard from London-Bridge to Chelsea, after the usual oratory of\n",
      "infants, to get me for a plaything.  The mother, out of pure indulgence,\n",
      "took me up, and put me towards the child, who presently seized me by the\n",
      "middle, and got my head into his mouth, where I roared so loud that the\n",
      "urchin was frighted, and let me drop, and I should infallibly have broke\n",
      "my neck, if the mother had not held her apron under me.  The nurse, to\n",
      "quiet her babe, made use of a rattle which was a kind of hollow vessel\n",
      "filled with great stones, and fastened by a cable to the child’s waist:\n",
      "but all in vain; so that she was forced to apply the last remedy by\n",
      "giving it suck.  I must confess no object ever disgusted me so much as\n",
      "the sight of her monstrous breast, which I cannot tell what to compare\n",
      "with, so as to give the curious reader an idea of its bulk, shape, and\n",
      "colour.  It stood prominent six feet, and could not be less than sixteen\n",
      "in circumference.  The nipple was about half the bigness of my head, and\n",
      "the hue both of that and the dug, so varied with spots, pimples, and\n",
      "freckles, that nothing could appear more nauseous: for I had a near sight\n",
      "of her, she sitting down, the more conveniently to give suck, and I\n",
      "standing on the table.  This made me reflect upon the fair skins of our\n",
      "English ladies, who appear so beautiful to us, only because they are of\n",
      "our own size, and their defects not to be seen but through a magnifying\n",
      "glass; where we find by experiment that the smoothest and whitest skins\n",
      "look rough, and coarse, and ill-coloured.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember when I was at Lilliput, the complexion of those diminutive\n",
      "people appeared to me the fairest in the world; and talking upon this\n",
      "subject with a person of learning there, who was an intimate friend of\n",
      "mine, he said that my face appeared much fairer and smoother when he\n",
      "looked on me from the ground, than it did upon a nearer view, when I took\n",
      "him up in my hand, and brought him close, which he confessed was at first\n",
      "a very shocking sight.  He said, “he could discover great holes in my\n",
      "skin; that the stumps of my beard were ten times stronger than the\n",
      "bristles of a boar, and my complexion made up of several colours\n",
      "altogether disagreeable:” although I must beg leave to say for myself,\n",
      "that I am as fair as most of my sex and country, and very little sunburnt\n",
      "by all my travels.  On the other side, discoursing of the ladies in that\n",
      "emperor’s court, he used to tell me, “one had freckles; another too wide\n",
      "a mouth; a third too large a nose;” nothing of which I was able to\n",
      "distinguish.  I confess this reflection was obvious enough; which,\n",
      "however, I could not forbear, lest the reader might think those vast\n",
      "creatures were actually deformed: for I must do them the justice to say,\n",
      "they are a comely race of people, and particularly the features of my\n",
      "master’s countenance, although he was but a farmer, when I beheld him\n",
      "from the height of sixty feet, appeared very well proportioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "When dinner was done, my master went out to his labourers, and, as I\n",
      "could discover by his voice and gesture, gave his wife strict charge to\n",
      "take care of me.  I was very much tired, and disposed to sleep, which my\n",
      "mistress perceiving, she put me on her own bed, and covered me with a\n",
      "clean white handkerchief, but larger and coarser than the mainsail of a\n",
      "man-of-war.\n",
      "\n",
      "I slept about two hours, and dreamt I was at home with my wife and\n",
      "children, which aggravated my sorrows when I awaked, and found myself\n",
      "alone in a vast room, between two and three hundred feet wide, and above\n",
      "two hundred high, lying in a bed twenty yards wide.  My mistress was gone\n",
      "about her household affairs, and had locked me in.  The bed was eight\n",
      "yards from the floor.  Some natural necessities required me to get down;\n",
      "I durst not presume to call; and if I had, it would have been in vain,\n",
      "with such a voice as mine, at so great a distance from the room where I\n",
      "lay to the kitchen where the family kept.  While I was under these\n",
      "circumstances, two rats crept up the curtains, and ran smelling backwards\n",
      "and forwards on the bed.  One of them came up almost to my face,\n",
      "whereupon I rose in a fright, and drew out my hanger to defend myself.\n",
      "These horrible animals had the boldness to attack me on both sides, and\n",
      "one of them held his fore-feet at my collar; but I had the good fortune\n",
      "to rip up his belly before he could do me any mischief.  He fell down at\n",
      "my feet; and the other, seeing the fate of his comrade, made his escape,\n",
      "but not without one good wound on the back, which I gave him as he fled,\n",
      "and made the blood run trickling from him.  After this exploit, I walked\n",
      "gently to and fro on the bed, to recover my breath and loss of spirits.\n",
      "These creatures were of the size of a large mastiff, but infinitely more\n",
      "nimble and fierce; so that if I had taken off my belt before I went to\n",
      "sleep, I must have infallibly been torn to pieces and devoured.  I\n",
      "measured the tail of the dead rat, and found it to be two yards long,\n",
      "wanting an inch; but it went against my stomach to drag the carcass off\n",
      "the bed, where it lay still bleeding; I observed it had yet some life,\n",
      "but with a strong slash across the neck, I thoroughly despatched it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after my mistress came into the room, who seeing me all bloody, ran\n",
      "and took me up in her hand.  I pointed to the dead rat, smiling, and\n",
      "making other signs to show I was not hurt; whereat she was extremely\n",
      "rejoiced, calling the maid to take up the dead rat with a pair of tongs,\n",
      "and throw it out of the window.  Then she set me on a table, where I\n",
      "showed her my hanger all bloody, and wiping it on the lappet of my coat,\n",
      "returned it to the scabbard.  I was pressed to do more than one thing\n",
      "which another could not do for me, and therefore endeavoured to make my\n",
      "mistress understand, that I desired to be set down on the floor; which\n",
      "after she had done, my bashfulness would not suffer me to express myself\n",
      "farther, than by pointing to the door, and bowing several times.  The\n",
      "good woman, with much difficulty, at last perceived what I would be at,\n",
      "and taking me up again in her hand, walked into the garden, where she set\n",
      "me down.  I went on one side about two hundred yards, and beckoning to\n",
      "her not to look or to follow me, I hid myself between two leaves of\n",
      "sorrel, and there discharged the necessities of nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope the gentle reader will excuse me for dwelling on these and the\n",
      "like particulars, which, however insignificant they may appear to\n",
      "groveling vulgar minds, yet will certainly help a philosopher to enlarge\n",
      "his thoughts and imagination, and apply them to the benefit of public as\n",
      "well as private life, which was my sole design in presenting this and\n",
      "other accounts of my travels to the world; wherein I have been chiefly\n",
      "studious of truth, without affecting any ornaments of learning or of\n",
      "style.  But the whole scene of this voyage made so strong an impression\n",
      "on my mind, and is so deeply fixed in my memory, that, in committing it\n",
      "to paper I did not omit one material circumstance: however, upon a strict\n",
      "review, I blotted out several passages.  Of less moment which were in my\n",
      "first copy, for fear of being censured as tedious and trifling, whereof\n",

      "CHAPTER II.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A description of the farmer’s daughter.  The author carried to a\n",
      "market-town, and then to the metropolis.  The particulars of his journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "My mistress had a daughter of nine years old, a child of towardly parts\n",
      "for her age, very dexterous at her needle, and skilful in dressing her\n",
      "baby.  Her mother and she contrived to fit up the baby’s cradle for me\n",
      "against night: the cradle was put into a small drawer of a cabinet, and\n",
      "the drawer placed upon a hanging shelf for fear of the rats.  This was my\n",
      "bed all the time I staid with those people, though made more convenient\n",
      "by degrees, as I began to learn their language and make my wants known.\n",
      "This young girl was so handy, that after I had once or twice pulled off\n",
      "my clothes before her, she was able to dress and undress me, though I\n",
      "never gave her that trouble when she would let me do either myself.  She\n",
      "made me seven shirts, and some other linen, of as fine cloth as could be\n",
      "got, which indeed was coarser than sackcloth; and these she constantly\n",
      "washed for me with her own hands.  She was likewise my school-mistress,\n",
      "to teach me the language: when I pointed to any thing, she told me the\n",
      "name of it in her own tongue, so that in a few days I was able to call\n",
      "for whatever I had a mind to.  She was very good-natured, and not above\n",
      "forty feet high, being little for her age.  She gave me the name of\n",
      "_Grildrig_, which the family took up, and afterwards the whole kingdom.\n",
      "The word imports what the Latins call _nanunculus_, the Italians\n",
      "_homunceletino_, and the English _mannikin_.  To her I chiefly owe my\n",
      "preservation in that country: we never parted while I was there; I called\n",
      "her my _Glumdalclitch_, or little nurse; and should be guilty of great\n",
      "ingratitude, if I omitted this honourable mention of her care and\n",
      "affection towards me, which I heartily wish it lay in my power to requite\n",
      "as she deserves, instead of being the innocent, but unhappy instrument of\n",
      "her disgrace, as I have too much reason to fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "It now began to be known and talked of in the neighbourhood, that my\n",
      "master had found a strange animal in the field, about the bigness of a\n",
      "_splacnuck_, but exactly shaped in every part like a human creature;\n",
      "which it likewise imitated in all its actions; seemed to speak in a\n",
      "little language of its own, had already learned several words of theirs,\n",
      "went erect upon two legs, was tame and gentle, would come when it was\n",
      "called, do whatever it was bid, had the finest limbs in the world, and a\n",
      "complexion fairer than a nobleman’s daughter of three years old.  Another\n",
      "farmer, who lived hard by, and was a particular friend of my master, came\n",
      "on a visit on purpose to inquire into the truth of this story.  I was\n",
      "immediately produced, and placed upon a table, where I walked as I was\n",
      "commanded, drew my hanger, put it up again, made my reverence to my\n",
      "master’s guest, asked him in his own language how he did, and told him\n",
      "_he was welcome_, just as my little nurse had instructed me.  This man,\n",
      "who was old and dim-sighted, put on his spectacles to behold me better;\n",
      "at which I could not forbear laughing very heartily, for his eyes\n",
      "appeared like the full moon shining into a chamber at two windows.  Our\n",
      "people, who discovered the cause of my mirth, bore me company in\n",
      "laughing, at which the old fellow was fool enough to be angry and out of\n",
      "countenance.  He had the character of a great miser; and, to my\n",
      "misfortune, he well deserved it, by the cursed advice he gave my master,\n",
      "to show me as a sight upon a market-day in the next town, which was half\n",
      "an hour’s riding, about two-and-twenty miles from our house.  I guessed\n",
      "there was some mischief when I observed my master and his friend\n",
      "whispering together, sometimes pointing at me; and my fears made me fancy\n",
      "that I overheard and understood some of their words.  But the next\n",
      "morning Glumdalclitch, my little nurse, told me the whole matter, which\n",
      "she had cunningly picked out from her mother.  The poor girl laid me on\n",
      "her bosom, and fell a weeping with shame and grief.  She apprehended some\n",
      "mischief would happen to me from rude vulgar folks, who might squeeze me\n",
      "to death, or break one of my limbs by taking me in their hands.  She had\n",
      "also observed how modest I was in my nature, how nicely I regarded my\n",
      "honour, and what an indignity I should conceive it, to be exposed for\n",
      "money as a public spectacle, to the meanest of the people.  She said, her\n",
      "papa and mamma had promised that Grildrig should be hers; but now she\n",
      "found they meant to serve her as they did last year, when they pretended\n",
      "to give her a lamb, and yet, as soon as it was fat, sold it to a butcher.\n",
      "For my own part, I may truly affirm, that I was less concerned than my\n",
      "nurse.  I had a strong hope, which never left me, that I should one day\n",
      "recover my liberty: and as to the ignominy of being carried about for a\n",
      "monster, I considered myself to be a perfect stranger in the country, and\n",
      "that such a misfortune could never be charged upon me as a reproach, if\n",
      "ever I should return to England, since the king of Great Britain himself,\n",
      "in my condition, must have undergone the same distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master, pursuant to the advice of his friend, carried me in a box the\n",
      "next market-day to the neighbouring town, and took along with him his\n",
      "little daughter, my nurse, upon a pillion behind him.  The box was close\n",
      "on every side, with a little door for me to go in and out, and a few\n",
      "gimlet holes to let in air.  The girl had been so careful as to put the\n",
      "quilt of her baby’s bed into it, for me to lie down on.  However, I was\n",
      "terribly shaken and discomposed in this journey, though it was but of\n",
      "half an hour: for the horse went about forty feet at every step and\n",
      "trotted so high, that the agitation was equal to the rising and falling\n",
      "of a ship in a great storm, but much more frequent.  Our journey was\n",
      "somewhat farther than from London to St. Alban’s.  My master alighted at\n",
      "an inn which he used to frequent; and after consulting awhile with the\n",
      "inn-keeper, and making some necessary preparations, he hired the\n",
      "_grultrud_, or crier, to give notice through the town of a strange\n",
      "creature to be seen at the sign of the Green Eagle, not so big as a\n",
      "_splacnuck_ (an animal in that country very finely shaped, about six feet\n",
      "long,) and in every part of the body resembling a human creature, could\n",
      "speak several words, and perform a hundred diverting tricks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was placed upon a table in the largest room of the inn, which might be\n",
      "near three hundred feet square.  My little nurse stood on a low stool\n",
      "close to the table, to take care of me, and direct what I should do.  My\n",
      "master, to avoid a crowd, would suffer only thirty people at a time to\n",
      "see me.  I walked about on the table as the girl commanded; she asked me\n",
      "questions, as far as she knew my understanding of the language reached,\n",
      "and I answered them as loud as I could.  I turned about several times to\n",
      "the company, paid my humble respects, said _they were welcome_, and used\n",
      "some other speeches I had been taught.  I took up a thimble filled with\n",
      "liquor, which Glumdalclitch had given me for a cup, and drank their\n",
      "health, I drew out my hanger, and flourished with it after the manner of\n",
      "fencers in England.  My nurse gave me a part of a straw, which I\n",
      "exercised as a pike, having learnt the art in my youth.  I was that day\n",
      "shown to twelve sets of company, and as often forced to act over again\n",
      "the same fopperies, till I was half dead with weariness and vexation; for\n",
      "those who had seen me made such wonderful reports, that the people were\n",
      "ready to break down the doors to come in.  My master, for his own\n",
      "interest, would not suffer any one to touch me except my nurse; and to\n",
      "prevent danger, benches were set round the table at such a distance as to\n",
      "put me out of every body’s reach.  However, an unlucky school-boy aimed a\n",
      "hazel nut directly at my head, which very narrowly missed me; otherwise\n",
      "it came with so much violence, that it would have infallibly knocked out\n",
      "my brains, for it was almost as large as a small pumpkin, but I had the\n",
      "satisfaction to see the young rogue well beaten, and turned out of the\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master gave public notice that he would show me again the next\n",
      "market-day; and in the meantime he prepared a convenient vehicle for me,\n",
      "which he had reason enough to do; for I was so tired with my first\n",
      "journey, and with entertaining company for eight hours together, that I\n",
      "could hardly stand upon my legs, or speak a word.  It was at least three\n",
      "days before I recovered my strength; and that I might have no rest at\n",
      "home, all the neighbouring gentlemen from a hundred miles round, hearing\n",
      "of my fame, came to see me at my master’s own house.  There could not be\n",
      "fewer than thirty persons with their wives and children (for the country\n",
      "is very populous;) and my master demanded the rate of a full room\n",
      "whenever he showed me at home, although it were only to a single family;\n",
      "so that for some time I had but little ease every day of the week (except\n",
      "Wednesday, which is their Sabbath,) although I were not carried to the\n",
      "town.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master, finding how profitable I was likely to be, resolved to carry\n",
      "me to the most considerable cities of the kingdom.  Having therefore\n",
      "provided himself with all things necessary for a long journey, and\n",
      "settled his affairs at home, he took leave of his wife, and upon the 17th\n",
      "of August, 1703, about two months after my arrival, we set out for the\n",
      "metropolis, situate near the middle of that empire, and about three\n",
      "thousand miles distance from our house.  My master made his daughter\n",
      "Glumdalclitch ride behind him.  She carried me on her lap, in a box tied\n",
      "about her waist.  The girl had lined it on all sides with the softest\n",
      "cloth she could get, well quilted underneath, furnished it with her\n",
      "baby’s bed, provided me with linen and other necessaries, and made\n",
      "everything as convenient as she could.  We had no other company but a boy\n",
      "of the house, who rode after us with the luggage.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master’s design was to show me in all the towns by the way, and to\n",
      "step out of the road for fifty or a hundred miles, to any village, or\n",
      "person of quality’s house, where he might expect custom.  We made easy\n",
      "journeys, of not above seven or eight score miles a-day; for\n",
      "Glumdalclitch, on purpose to spare me, complained she was tired with the\n",
      "trotting of the horse.  She often took me out of my box, at my own\n",
      "desire, to give me air, and show me the country, but always held me fast\n",
      "by a leading-string.  We passed over five or six rivers, many degrees\n",
      "broader and deeper than the Nile or the Ganges: and there was hardly a\n",
      "rivulet so small as the Thames at London-bridge.  We were ten weeks in\n",
      "our journey, and I was shown in eighteen large towns, besides many\n",
      "villages, and private families.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the 26th day of October we arrived at the metropolis, called in their\n",
      "language _Lorbrulgrud_, or Pride of the Universe.  My master took a\n",
      "lodging in the principal street of the city, not far from the royal\n",
      "palace, and put out bills in the usual form, containing an exact\n",
      "description of my person and parts.  He hired a large room between three\n",
      "and four hundred feet wide.  He provided a table sixty feet in diameter,\n",
      "upon which I was to act my part, and pallisadoed it round three feet from\n",
      "the edge, and as many high, to prevent my falling over.  I was shown ten\n",
      "times a-day, to the wonder and satisfaction of all people.  I could now\n",
      "speak the language tolerably well, and perfectly understood every word,\n",
      "that was spoken to me.  Besides, I had learnt their alphabet, and could\n",
      "make a shift to explain a sentence here and there; for Glumdalclitch had\n",
      "been my instructor while we were at home, and at leisure hours during our\n",
      "journey.  She carried a little book in her pocket, not much larger than a\n",
      "Sanson’s Atlas; it was a common treatise for the use of young girls,\n",
      "giving a short account of their religion: out of this she taught me my\n",
      "letters, and interpreted the words.\n",

      "CHAPTER III.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The author sent for to court.  The queen buys him of his master the\n",
      "farmer, and presents him to the king.  He disputes with his majesty’s\n",
      "great scholars.  An apartment at court provided for the author.  He is in\n",
      "high favour with the queen.  He stands up for the honour of his own\n",
      "country.  His quarrels with the queen’s dwarf.\n",
      "\n",
      "The frequent labours I underwent every day, made, in a few weeks, a very\n",
      "considerable change in my health: the more my master got by me, the more\n",
      "insatiable he grew.  I had quite lost my stomach, and was almost reduced\n",
      "to a skeleton.  The farmer observed it, and concluding I must soon die,\n",
      "resolved to make as good a hand of me as he could.  While he was thus\n",
      "reasoning and resolving with himself, a _sardral_, or gentleman-usher,\n",
      "came from court, commanding my master to carry me immediately thither for\n",
      "the diversion of the queen and her ladies.  Some of the latter had\n",
      "already been to see me, and reported strange things of my beauty,\n",
      "behaviour, and good sense.  Her majesty, and those who attended her, were\n",
      "beyond measure delighted with my demeanour.  I fell on my knees, and\n",
      "begged the honour of kissing her imperial foot; but this gracious\n",
      "princess held out her little finger towards me, after I was set on the\n",
      "table, which I embraced in both my arms, and put the tip of it with the\n",
      "utmost respect to my lip.  She made me some general questions about my\n",
      "country and my travels, which I answered as distinctly, and in as few\n",
      "words as I could.  She asked, “whether I could be content to live at\n",
      "court?”  I bowed down to the board of the table, and humbly answered\n",
      "“that I was my master’s slave: but, if I were at my own disposal, I\n",
      "should be proud to devote my life to her majesty’s service.”  She then\n",
      "asked my master, “whether he was willing to sell me at a good price?”\n",
      "He, who apprehended I could not live a month, was ready enough to part\n",
      "with me, and demanded a thousand pieces of gold, which were ordered him\n",
      "on the spot, each piece being about the bigness of eight hundred\n",
      "moidores; but allowing for the proportion of all things between that\n",
      "country and Europe, and the high price of gold among them, was hardly so\n",
      "great a sum as a thousand guineas would be in England.  I then said to\n",
      "the queen, “since I was now her majesty’s most humble creature and\n",
      "vassal, I must beg the favour, that Glumdalclitch, who had always tended\n",
      "me with so much care and kindness, and understood to do it so well, might\n",
      "be admitted into her service, and continue to be my nurse and\n",
      "instructor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her majesty agreed to my petition, and easily got the farmer’s consent,\n",
      "who was glad enough to have his daughter preferred at court, and the poor\n",
      "girl herself was not able to hide her joy.  My late master withdrew,\n",
      "bidding me farewell, and saying he had left me in a good service; to\n",
      "which I replied not a word, only making him a slight bow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The queen observed my coldness; and, when the farmer was gone out of the\n",
      "apartment, asked me the reason.  I made bold to tell her majesty, “that I\n",
      "owed no other obligation to my late master, than his not dashing out the\n",
      "brains of a poor harmless creature, found by chance in his fields: which\n",
      "obligation was amply recompensed, by the gain he had made in showing me\n",
      "through half the kingdom, and the price he had now sold me for.  That the\n",
      "life I had since led was laborious enough to kill an animal of ten times\n",
      "my strength.  That my health was much impaired, by the continual drudgery\n",
      "of entertaining the rabble every hour of the day; and that, if my master\n",
      "had not thought my life in danger, her majesty would not have got so\n",
      "cheap a bargain.  But as I was out of all fear of being ill-treated under\n",
      "the protection of so great and good an empress, the ornament of nature,\n",
      "the darling of the world, the delight of her subjects, the phoenix of the\n",
      "creation, so I hoped my late master’s apprehensions would appear to be\n",
      "groundless; for I already found my spirits revive, by the influence of\n",
      "her most august presence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the sum of my speech, delivered with great improprieties and\n",
      "hesitation.  The latter part was altogether framed in the style peculiar\n",
      "to that people, whereof I learned some phrases from Glumdalclitch, while\n",
      "she was carrying me to court.\n",
      "\n",
      "The queen, giving great allowance for my defectiveness in speaking, was,\n",
      "however, surprised at so much wit and good sense in so diminutive an\n",
      "animal.  She took me in her own hand, and carried me to the king, who was\n",
      "then retired to his cabinet.  His majesty, a prince of much gravity and\n",
      "austere countenance, not well observing my shape at first view, asked the\n",
      "queen after a cold manner “how long it was since she grew fond of a\n",
      "_splacnuck_?” for such it seems he took me to be, as I lay upon my breast\n",
      "in her majesty’s right hand.  But this princess, who has an infinite deal\n",
      "of wit and humour, set me gently on my feet upon the scrutoire, and\n",
      "commanded me to give his majesty an account of myself, which I did in a\n",
      "very few words: and Glumdalclitch who attended at the cabinet door, and\n",
      "could not endure I should be out of her sight, being admitted, confirmed\n",
      "all that had passed from my arrival at her father’s house.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king, although he be as learned a person as any in his dominions, had\n",
      "been educated in the study of philosophy, and particularly mathematics;\n",
      "yet when he observed my shape exactly, and saw me walk erect, before I\n",
      "began to speak, conceived I might be a piece of clock-work (which is in\n",
      "that country arrived to a very great perfection) contrived by some\n",
      "ingenious artist.  But when he heard my voice, and found what I delivered\n",
      "to be regular and rational, he could not conceal his astonishment.  He\n",
      "was by no means satisfied with the relation I gave him of the manner I\n",
      "came into his kingdom, but thought it a story concerted between\n",
      "Glumdalclitch and her father, who had taught me a set of words to make me\n",
      "sell at a better price.  Upon this imagination, he put several other\n",
      "questions to me, and still received rational answers: no otherwise\n",
      "defective than by a foreign accent, and an imperfect knowledge in the\n",
      "language, with some rustic phrases which I had learned at the farmer’s\n",
      "house, and did not suit the polite style of a court.\n",
      "\n",
      "His majesty sent for three great scholars, who were then in their weekly\n",
      "waiting, according to the custom in that country.  These gentlemen, after\n",
      "they had a while examined my shape with much nicety, were of different\n",
      "opinions concerning me.  They all agreed that I could not be produced\n",
      "according to the regular laws of nature, because I was not framed with a\n",
      "capacity of preserving my life, either by swiftness, or climbing of\n",
      "trees, or digging holes in the earth.  They observed by my teeth, which\n",
      "they viewed with great exactness, that I was a carnivorous animal; yet\n",
      "most quadrupeds being an overmatch for me, and field mice, with some\n",
      "others, too nimble, they could not imagine how I should be able to\n",
      "support myself, unless I fed upon snails and other insects, which they\n",
      "offered, by many learned arguments, to evince that I could not possibly\n",
      "do.  One of these virtuosi seemed to think that I might be an embryo, or\n",
      "abortive birth.  But this opinion was rejected by the other two, who\n",
      "observed my limbs to be perfect and finished; and that I had lived\n",
      "several years, as it was manifest from my beard, the stumps whereof they\n",
      "plainly discovered through a magnifying glass.  They would not allow me\n",
      "to be a dwarf, because my littleness was beyond all degrees of\n",
      "comparison; for the queen’s favourite dwarf, the smallest ever known in\n",
      "that kingdom, was near thirty feet high.  After much debate, they\n",
      "concluded unanimously, that I was only _relplum scalcath_, which is\n",
      "interpreted literally _lusus naturæ_; a determination exactly agreeable\n",
      "to the modern philosophy of Europe, whose professors, disdaining the old\n",
      "evasion of occult causes, whereby the followers of Aristotle endeavoured\n",
      "in vain to disguise their ignorance, have invented this wonderful\n",
      "solution of all difficulties, to the unspeakable advancement of human\n",
      "knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this decisive conclusion, I entreated to be heard a word or two.  I\n",
      "applied myself to the king, and assured his majesty, “that I came from a\n",
      "country which abounded with several millions of both sexes, and of my own\n",
      "stature; where the animals, trees, and houses, were all in proportion,\n",
      "and where, by consequence, I might be as able to defend myself, and to\n",
      "find sustenance, as any of his majesty’s subjects could do here; which I\n",
      "took for a full answer to those gentlemen’s arguments.”  To this they\n",
      "only replied with a smile of contempt, saying, “that the farmer had\n",
      "instructed me very well in my lesson.”  The king, who had a much better\n",
      "understanding, dismissing his learned men, sent for the farmer, who by\n",
      "good fortune was not yet gone out of town.  Having therefore first\n",
      "examined him privately, and then confronted him with me and the young\n",
      "girl, his majesty began to think that what we told him might possibly be\n",
      "true. He desired the queen to order that a particular care should be\n",
      "taken of me; and was of opinion that Glumdalclitch should still continue\n",
      "in her office of tending me, because he observed we had a great affection\n",
      "for each other.  A convenient apartment was provided for her at court:\n",
      "she had a sort of governess appointed to take care of her education, a\n",
      "maid to dress her, and two other servants for menial offices; but the\n",
      "care of me was wholly appropriated to herself.  The queen commanded her\n",
      "own cabinet-maker to contrive a box, that might serve me for a\n",
      "bedchamber, after the model that Glumdalclitch and I should agree upon.\n",
      "This man was a most ingenious artist, and according to my direction, in\n",
      "three weeks finished for me a wooden chamber of sixteen feet square, and\n",
      "twelve high, with sash-windows, a door, and two closets, like a London\n",
      "bed-chamber.  The board, that made the ceiling, was to be lifted up and\n",
      "down by two hinges, to put in a bed ready furnished by her majesty’s\n",
      "upholsterer, which Glumdalclitch took out every day to air, made it with\n",
      "her own hands, and letting it down at night, locked up the roof over me.\n",
      "A nice workman, who was famous for little curiosities, undertook to make\n",
      "me two chairs, with backs and frames, of a substance not unlike ivory,\n",
      "and two tables, with a cabinet to put my things in.  The room was quilted\n",
      "on all sides, as well as the floor and the ceiling, to prevent any\n",
      "accident from the carelessness of those who carried me, and to break the\n",
      "force of a jolt, when I went in a coach.  I desired a lock for my door,\n",
      "to prevent rats and mice from coming in.  The smith, after several\n",
      "attempts, made the smallest that ever was seen among them, for I have\n",
      "known a larger at the gate of a gentleman’s house in England.  I made a\n",
      "shift to keep the key in a pocket of my own, fearing Glumdalclitch might\n",
      "lose it.  The queen likewise ordered the thinnest silks that could be\n",
      "gotten, to make me clothes, not much thicker than an English blanket,\n",
      "very cumbersome till I was accustomed to them.  They were after the\n",
      "fashion of the kingdom, partly resembling the Persian, and partly the\n",
      "Chinese, and are a very grave and decent habit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The queen became so fond of my company, that she could not dine without\n",
      "me.  I had a table placed upon the same at which her majesty ate, just at\n",
      "her left elbow, and a chair to sit on.  Glumdalclitch stood on a stool on\n",
      "the floor near my table, to assist and take care of me.  I had an entire\n",
      "set of silver dishes and plates, and other necessaries, which, in\n",
      "proportion to those of the queen, were not much bigger than what I have\n",
      "seen in a London toy-shop for the furniture of a baby-house: these my\n",
      "little nurse kept in her pocket in a silver box, and gave me at meals as\n",
      "I wanted them, always cleaning them herself.  No person dined with the\n",
      "queen but the two princesses royal, the eldest sixteen years old, and the\n",
      "younger at that time thirteen and a month.  Her majesty used to put a bit\n",
      "of meat upon one of my dishes, out of which I carved for myself, and her\n",
      "diversion was to see me eat in miniature: for the queen (who had indeed\n",
      "but a weak stomach) took up, at one mouthful, as much as a dozen English\n",
      "farmers could eat at a meal, which to me was for some time a very\n",
      "nauseous sight.  She would craunch the wing of a lark, bones and all,\n",
      "between her teeth, although it were nine times as large as that of a\n",
      "full-grown turkey; and put a bit of bread into her mouth as big as two\n",
      "twelve-penny loaves.  She drank out of a golden cup, above a hogshead at\n",
      "a draught.  Her knives were twice as long as a scythe, set straight upon\n",
      "the handle.  The spoons, forks, and other instruments, were all in the\n",
      "same proportion.  I remember when Glumdalclitch carried me, out of\n",
      "curiosity, to see some of the tables at court, where ten or a dozen of\n",
      "those enormous knives and forks were lifted up together, I thought I had\n",
      "never till then beheld so terrible a sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the custom, that every Wednesday (which, as I have observed, is\n",
      "their Sabbath) the king and queen, with the royal issue of both sexes,\n",
      "dine together in the apartment of his majesty, to whom I was now become a\n",
      "great favourite; and at these times, my little chair and table were\n",
      "placed at his left hand, before one of the salt-cellars.  This prince\n",
      "took a pleasure in conversing with me, inquiring into the manners,\n",
      "religion, laws, government, and learning of Europe; wherein I gave him\n",
      "the best account I was able.  His apprehension was so clear, and his\n",
      "judgment so exact, that he made very wise reflections and observations\n",
      "upon all I said.  But I confess, that, after I had been a little too\n",
      "copious in talking of my own beloved country, of our trade and wars by\n",
      "sea and land, of our schisms in religion, and parties in the state; the\n",
      "prejudices of his education prevailed so far, that he could not forbear\n",
      "taking me up in his right hand, and stroking me gently with the other,\n",
      "after a hearty fit of laughing, asked me, “whether I was a whig or tory?”\n",
      "Then turning to his first minister, who waited behind him with a white\n",
      "staff, near as tall as the mainmast of the Royal Sovereign, he observed\n",
      "“how contemptible a thing was human grandeur, which could be mimicked by\n",
      "such diminutive insects as I: and yet,” says he, “I dare engage these\n",
      "creatures have their titles and distinctions of honour; they contrive\n",
      "little nests and burrows, that they call houses and cities; they make a\n",
      "figure in dress and equipage; they love, they fight, they dispute, they\n",
      "cheat, they betray!”  And thus he continued on, while my colour came and\n",
      "went several times, with indignation, to hear our noble country, the\n",
      "mistress of arts and arms, the scourge of France, the arbitress of\n",
      "Europe, the seat of virtue, piety, honour, and truth, the pride and envy\n",
      "of the world, so contemptuously treated.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as I was not in a condition to resent injuries, so upon mature\n",
      "thoughts I began to doubt whether I was injured or no.  For, after having\n",
      "been accustomed several months to the sight and converse of this people,\n",
      "and observed every object upon which I cast mine eyes to be of\n",
      "proportionable magnitude, the horror I had at first conceived from their\n",
      "bulk and aspect was so far worn off, that if I had then beheld a company\n",
      "of English lords and ladies in their finery and birth-day clothes, acting\n",
      "their several parts in the most courtly manner of strutting, and bowing,\n",
      "and prating, to say the truth, I should have been strongly tempted to\n",
      "laugh as much at them as the king and his grandees did at me.  Neither,\n",
      "indeed, could I forbear smiling at myself, when the queen used to place\n",
      "me upon her hand towards a looking-glass, by which both our persons\n",
      "appeared before me in full view together; and there could be nothing more\n",
      "ridiculous than the comparison; so that I really began to imagine myself\n",
      "dwindled many degrees below my usual size.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing angered and mortified me so much as the queen’s dwarf; who being\n",
      "of the lowest stature that was ever in that country (for I verily think\n",
      "he was not full thirty feet high), became so insolent at seeing a\n",
      "creature so much beneath him, that he would always affect to swagger and\n",
      "look big as he passed by me in the queen’s antechamber, while I was\n",
      "standing on some table talking with the lords or ladies of the court, and\n",
      "he seldom failed of a smart word or two upon my littleness; against which\n",
      "I could only revenge myself by calling him brother, challenging him to\n",
      "wrestle, and such repartees as are usually in the mouths of court pages.\n",
      "One day, at dinner, this malicious little cub was so nettled with\n",
      "something I had said to him, that, raising himself upon the frame of her\n",
      "majesty’s chair, he took me up by the middle, as I was sitting down, not\n",
      "thinking any harm, and let me drop into a large silver bowl of cream, and\n",
      "then ran away as fast as he could.  I fell over head and ears, and, if I\n",
      "had not been a good swimmer, it might have gone very hard with me; for\n",
      "Glumdalclitch in that instant happened to be at the other end of the\n",
      "room, and the queen was in such a fright, that she wanted presence of\n",
      "mind to assist me.  But my little nurse ran to my relief, and took me\n",
      "out, after I had swallowed above a quart of cream.  I was put to bed:\n",
      "however, I received no other damage than the loss of a suit of clothes,\n",
      "which was utterly spoiled.  The dwarf was soundly whipt, and as a farther\n",
      "punishment, forced to drink up the bowl of cream into which he had thrown\n",
      "me: neither was he ever restored to favour; for soon after the queen\n",
      "bestowed him on a lady of high quality, so that I saw him no more, to my\n",
      "very great satisfaction; for I could not tell to what extremities such a\n",
      "malicious urchin might have carried his resentment.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had before served me a scurvy trick, which set the queen a-laughing,\n",
      "although at the same time she was heartily vexed, and would have\n",
      "immediately cashiered him, if I had not been so generous as to intercede.\n",
      "Her majesty had taken a marrow-bone upon her plate, and, after knocking\n",
      "out the marrow, placed the bone again in the dish erect, as it stood\n",
      "before; the dwarf, watching his opportunity, while Glumdalclitch was gone\n",
      "to the side-board, mounted the stool that she stood on to take care of me\n",
      "at meals, took me up in both hands, and squeezing my legs together,\n",
      "wedged them into the marrow bone above my waist, where I stuck for some\n",
      "time, and made a very ridiculous figure.  I believe it was near a minute\n",
      "before any one knew what was become of me; for I thought it below me to\n",
      "cry out.  But, as princes seldom get their meat hot, my legs were not\n",
      "scalded, only my stockings and breeches in a sad condition.  The dwarf,\n",
      "at my entreaty, had no other punishment than a sound whipping.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was frequently rallied by the queen upon account of my fearfulness; and\n",
      "she used to ask me whether the people of my country were as great cowards\n",
      "as myself?  The occasion was this: the kingdom is much pestered with\n",
      "flies in summer; and these odious insects, each of them as big as a\n",
      "Dunstable lark, hardly gave me any rest while I sat at dinner, with their\n",
      "continual humming and buzzing about mine ears.  They would sometimes\n",
      "alight upon my victuals, and leave their loathsome excrement, or spawn\n",
      "behind, which to me was very visible, though not to the natives of that\n",
      "country, whose large optics were not so acute as mine, in viewing smaller\n",
      "objects.  Sometimes they would fix upon my nose, or forehead, where they\n",
      "stung me to the quick, smelling very offensively; and I could easily\n",
      "trace that viscous matter, which, our naturalists tell us, enables those\n",
      "creatures to walk with their feet upwards upon a ceiling.  I had much ado\n",
      "to defend myself against these detestable animals, and could not forbear\n",
      "starting when they came on my face.  It was the common practice of the\n",
      "dwarf, to catch a number of these insects in his hand, as schoolboys do\n",
      "among us, and let them out suddenly under my nose, on purpose to frighten\n",
      "me, and divert the queen.  My remedy was to cut them in pieces with my\n",
      "knife, as they flew in the air, wherein my dexterity was much admired.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember, one morning, when Glumdalclitch had set me in a box upon a\n",

      "cages in England), after I had lifted up one of my sashes, and sat down\n",
      "at my table to eat a piece of sweet cake for my breakfast, above twenty\n",
      "wasps, allured by the smell, came flying into the room, humming louder\n",
      "than the drones of as many bagpipes.  Some of them seized my cake, and\n",
      "carried it piecemeal away; others flew about my head and face,\n",
      "confounding me with the noise, and putting me in the utmost terror of\n",
      "their stings.  However, I had the courage to rise and draw my hanger, and\n",
      "attack them in the air.  I dispatched four of them, but the rest got\n",
      "away, and I presently shut my window.  These insects were as large as\n",
      "partridges: I took out their stings, found them an inch and a half long,\n",
      "and as sharp as needles.  I carefully preserved them all; and having\n",
      "since shown them, with some other curiosities, in several parts of\n",
      "Europe, upon my return to England I gave three of them to Gresham\n",

      "Lorbrulgrud, the metropolis.  For the queen, whom I always attended,\n",

      "whole extent of this prince’s dominions reaches about six thousand miles\n",
      "in length, and from three to five in breadth: whence I cannot but\n",
      "conclude, that our geographers of Europe are in a great error, by\n",
      "supposing nothing but sea between Japan and California; for it was ever\n",
      "my opinion, that there must be a balance of earth to counterpoise the\n",

      "maps and charts, by joining this vast tract of land to the north-west\n",
      "parts of America, wherein I shall be ready to lend them my assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The kingdom is a peninsula, terminated to the north-east by a ridge of\n",
      "mountains thirty miles high, which are altogether impassable, by reason\n",
      "of the volcanoes upon the tops: neither do the most learned know what\n",
      "sort of mortals inhabit beyond those mountains, or whether they be\n",

      "their boats; so that these people are wholly excluded from any commerce\n",
      "with the rest of the world.  But the large rivers are full of vessels,\n",
      "and abound with excellent fish; for they seldom get any from the sea,\n",
      "because the sea fish are of the same size with those in Europe, and\n",
      "consequently not worth catching; whereby it is manifest, that nature, in\n",
      "the production of plants and animals of so extraordinary a bulk, is\n",
      "wholly confined to this continent, of which I leave the reasons to be\n",
      "determined by philosophers.  However, now and then they take a whale that\n",

      "curious reader, it may be sufficient to describe Lorbrulgrud.  This city\n",
      "stands upon almost two equal parts, on each side the river that passes\n",
      "through.  It contains above eighty thousand houses, and about six hundred\n",
      "thousand inhabitants.  It is in length three _glomglungs_ (which make\n",
      "about fifty-four English miles,) and two and a half in breadth; as I\n",
      "measured it myself in the royal map made by the king’s order, which was\n",
      "laid on the ground on purpose for me, and extended a hundred feet: I\n",
      "paced the diameter and circumference several times barefoot, and,\n",
      "computing by the scale, measured it pretty exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king’s palace is no regular edifice, but a heap of buildings, about\n",
      "seven miles round: the chief rooms are generally two hundred and forty\n",

      "me out, and hold me in her hand, that I might more conveniently view the\n",
      "houses and the people, as we passed along the streets.  I reckoned our\n",
      "coach to be about a square of Westminster-hall, but not altogether so\n",
      "high: however, I cannot be very exact.  One day the governess ordered our\n",
      "coachman to stop at several shops, where the beggars, watching their\n",
      "opportunity, crowded to the sides of the coach, and gave me the most\n",
      "horrible spectacle that ever a European eye beheld.  There was a woman\n",
      "with a cancer in her breast, swelled to a monstrous size, full of holes,\n",
      "in two or three of which I could have easily crept, and covered my whole\n",
      "body.  There was a fellow with a wen in his neck, larger than five\n",
      "wool-packs; and another, with a couple of wooden legs, each about twenty\n",
      "feet high.  But the most hateful sight of all, was the lice crawling on\n",
      "their clothes.  I could see distinctly the limbs of these vermin with my\n",
      "naked eye, much better than those of a European louse through a\n",
      "microscope, and their snouts with which they rooted like swine.  They\n",
      "were the first I had ever beheld, and I should have been curious enough\n",
      "to dissect one of them, if I had had proper instruments, which I\n",
      "unluckily left behind me in the ship, although, indeed, the sight was so\n",
      "nauseous, that it perfectly turned my stomach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the large box in which I was usually carried, the queen ordered a\n",
      "smaller one to be made for me, of about twelve feet square, and ten high,\n",
      "for the convenience of travelling; because the other was somewhat too\n",
      "large for Glumdalclitch’s lap, and cumbersome in the coach; it was made\n",
      "by the same artist, whom I directed in the whole contrivance.  This\n",
      "travelling-closet was an exact square, with a window in the middle of\n",
      "three of the squares, and each window was latticed with iron wire on the\n",
      "outside, to prevent accidents in long journeys.  On the fourth side,\n",
      "which had no window, two strong staples were fixed, through which the\n",
      "person that carried me, when I had a mind to be on horseback, put a\n",
      "leathern belt, and buckled it about his waist.  This was always the\n",
      "office of some grave trusty servant, in whom I could confide, whether I\n",
      "attended the king and queen in their progresses, or were disposed to see\n",
      "the gardens, or pay a visit to some great lady or minister of state in\n",
      "the court, when Glumdalclitch happened to be out of order; for I soon\n",
      "began to be known and esteemed among the greatest officers, I suppose\n",
      "more upon account of their majesties’ favour, than any merit of my own.\n",
      "In journeys, when I was weary of the coach, a servant on horseback would\n",
      "buckle on my box, and place it upon a cushion before him; and there I had\n",
      "a full prospect of the country on three sides, from my three windows.  I\n",
      "had, in this closet, a field-bed and a hammock, hung from the ceiling,\n",
      "two chairs and a table, neatly screwed to the floor, to prevent being\n",
      "tossed about by the agitation of the horse or the coach.  And having been\n",
      "long used to sea-voyages, those motions, although sometimes very violent,\n",
      "did not much discompose me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever I had a mind to see the town, it was always in my\n",
      "travelling-closet; which Glumdalclitch held in her lap in a kind of open\n",
      "sedan, after the fashion of the country, borne by four men, and attended\n",
      "by two others in the queen’s livery.  The people, who had often heard of\n",
      "me, were very curious to crowd about the sedan, and the girl was\n",
      "complaisant enough to make the bearers stop, and to take me in her hand,\n",
      "that I might be more conveniently seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was very desirous to see the chief temple, and particularly the tower\n",
      "belonging to it, which is reckoned the highest in the kingdom.\n",
      "Accordingly one day my nurse carried me thither, but I may truly say I\n",
      "came back disappointed; for the height is not above three thousand feet,\n",
      "reckoning from the ground to the highest pinnacle top; which, allowing\n",
      "for the difference between the size of those people and us in Europe, is\n",
      "no great matter for admiration, nor at all equal in proportion (if I\n",
      "rightly remember) to Salisbury steeple.  But, not to detract from a\n",
      "nation, to which, during my life, I shall acknowledge myself extremely\n",
      "obliged, it must be allowed, that whatever this famous tower wants in\n",
      "height, is amply made up in beauty and strength: for the walls are near a\n",
      "hundred feet thick, built of hewn stone, whereof each is about forty feet\n",
      "square, and adorned on all sides with statues of gods and emperors, cut\n",
      "in marble, larger than the life, placed in their several niches.  I\n",
      "measured a little finger which had fallen down from one of these statues,\n",
      "and lay unperceived among some rubbish, and found it exactly four feet\n",
      "and an inch in length.  Glumdalclitch wrapped it up in her handkerchief,\n",
      "and carried it home in her pocket, to keep among other trinkets, of which\n",
      "the girl was very fond, as children at her age usually are.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king’s kitchen is indeed a noble building, vaulted at top, and about\n",
      "six hundred feet high.  The great oven is not so wide, by ten paces, as\n",
      "the cupola at St. Paul’s: for I measured the latter on purpose, after my\n",
      "return.  But if I should describe the kitchen grate, the prodigious pots\n",
      "and kettles, the joints of meat turning on the spits, with many other\n",

      "critic would be apt to think I enlarged a little, as travellers are often\n",
      "suspected to do.  To avoid which censure I fear I have run too much into\n",
      "the other extreme; and that if this treatise should happen to be\n",
      "translated into the language of Brobdingnag (which is the general name of\n",

      "gardener, who knew me well, and had a great kindness for me, was in a\n",
      "terrible fright: he gently took me up in both his hands, and asked me how\n",

      "word.  In a few minutes I came to myself, and he carried me safe to my\n",

      "before.  But one day, I took a thick cudgel, and threw it with all my\n",
      "strength so luckily, at a linnet, that I knocked him down, and seizing\n",
      "him by the neck with both my hands, ran with him in triumph to my nurse.\n",
      "However, the bird, who had only been stunned, recovering himself gave me\n",
      "so many boxes with his wings, on both sides of my head and body, though I\n",
      "held him at arm’s-length, and was out of the reach of his claws, that I\n",
      "was twenty times thinking to let him go.  But I was soon relieved by one\n",
      "of our servants, who wrung off the bird’s neck, and I had him next day\n",
      "for dinner, by the queen’s command.  This linnet, as near as I can\n",
      "remember, seemed to be somewhat larger than an English swan.\n",

      "The maids of honour often invited Glumdalclitch to their apartments, and\n",
      "desired she would bring me along with her, on purpose to have the\n",
      "pleasure of seeing and touching me.  They would often strip me naked from\n",
      "top to toe, and lay me at full length in their bosoms; wherewith I was\n",
      "much disgusted because, to say the truth, a very offensive smell came\n",
      "from their skins; which I do not mention, or intend, to the disadvantage\n",
      "of those excellent ladies, for whom I have all manner of respect; but I\n",
      "conceive that my sense was more acute in proportion to my littleness, and\n",
      "that those illustrious persons were no more disagreeable to their lovers,\n",
      "or to each other, than people of the same quality are with us in England.\n",
      "And, after all, I found their natural smell was much more supportable,\n",
      "than when they used perfumes, under which I immediately swooned away.  I\n",
      "cannot forget, that an intimate friend of mine in Lilliput, took the\n",
      "freedom in a warm day, when I had used a good deal of exercise, to\n",
      "complain of a strong smell about me, although I am as little faulty that\n",
      "way, as most of my sex: but I suppose his faculty of smelling was as nice\n",
      "with regard to me, as mine was to that of this people.  Upon this point,\n",
      "I cannot forbear doing justice to the queen my mistress, and\n",
      "Glumdalclitch my nurse, whose persons were as sweet as those of any lady\n",
      "in England.\n",
      "\n",
      "That which gave me most uneasiness among these maids of honour (when my\n",
      "nurse carried me to visit then) was, to see them use me without any\n",
      "manner of ceremony, like a creature who had no sort of consequence: for\n",
      "they would strip themselves to the skin, and put on their smocks in my\n",
      "presence, while I was placed on their toilet, directly before their naked\n",
      "bodies, which I am sure to me was very far from being a tempting sight,\n",
      "or from giving me any other emotions than those of horror and disgust:\n",
      "their skins appeared so coarse and uneven, so variously coloured, when I\n",
      "saw them near, with a mole here and there as broad as a trencher, and\n",
      "hairs hanging from it thicker than packthreads, to say nothing farther\n",
      "concerning the rest of their persons.  Neither did they at all scruple,\n",
      "while I was by, to discharge what they had drank, to the quantity of at\n",
      "least two hogsheads, in a vessel that held above three tuns.  The\n",
      "handsomest among these maids of honour, a pleasant, frolicsome girl of\n",
      "sixteen, would sometimes set me astride upon one of her nipples, with\n",
      "many other tricks, wherein the reader will excuse me for not being over\n",
      "particular.  But I was so much displeased, that I entreated Glumdalclitch\n",
      "to contrive some excuse for not seeing that young lady any more.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, a young gentleman, who was nephew to my nurse’s governess, came\n",
      "and pressed them both to see an execution.  It was of a man, who had\n",
      "murdered one of that gentleman’s intimate acquaintance.  Glumdalclitch\n",
      "was prevailed on to be of the company, very much against her inclination,\n",
      "for she was naturally tender-hearted: and, as for myself, although I\n",
      "abhorred such kind of spectacles, yet my curiosity tempted me to see\n",
      "something that I thought must be extraordinary.  The malefactor was fixed\n",
      "in a chair upon a scaffold erected for that purpose, and his head cut off\n",
      "at one blow, with a sword of about forty feet long.  The veins and\n",
      "arteries spouted up such a prodigious quantity of blood, and so high in\n",
      "the air, that the great _jet d’eau_ at Versailles was not equal to it for\n",
      "the time it lasted: and the head, when it fell on the scaffold floor,\n",
      "gave such a bounce as made me start, although I was at least half an\n",
      "English mile distant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The queen, who often used to hear me talk of my sea-voyages, and took all\n",
      "occasions to divert me when I was melancholy, asked me whether I\n",
      "understood how to handle a sail or an oar, and whether a little exercise\n",
      "of rowing might not be convenient for my health?  I answered, that I\n",
      "understood both very well: for although my proper employment had been to\n",
      "be surgeon or doctor to the ship, yet often, upon a pinch, I was forced\n",
      "to work like a common mariner.  But I could not see how this could be\n",
      "done in their country, where the smallest wherry was equal to a\n",
      "first-rate man of war among us; and such a boat as I could manage would\n",
      "never live in any of their rivers.  Her majesty said, if I would contrive\n",
      "a boat, her own joiner should make it, and she would provide a place for\n",
      "me to sail in.  The fellow was an ingenious workman, and by my\n",
      "instructions, in ten days, finished a pleasure-boat with all its\n",
      "tackling, able conveniently to hold eight Europeans.  When it was\n",
      "finished, the queen was so delighted, that she ran with it in her lap to\n",
      "the king, who ordered it to be put into a cistern full of water, with me\n",
      "in it, by way of trial, where I could not manage my two sculls, or little\n",
      "oars, for want of room.  But the queen had before contrived another\n",
      "project.  She ordered the joiner to make a wooden trough of three hundred\n",
      "feet long, fifty broad, and eight deep; which, being well pitched, to\n",
      "prevent leaking, was placed on the floor, along the wall, in an outer\n",
      "room of the palace.  It had a cock near the bottom to let out the water,\n",
      "when it began to grow stale; and two servants could easily fill it in\n",
      "half an hour.  Here I often used to row for my own diversion, as well as\n",
      "that of the queen and her ladies, who thought themselves well entertained\n",
      "with my skill and agility.  Sometimes I would put up my sail, and then my\n",
      "business was only to steer, while the ladies gave me a gale with their\n",
      "fans; and, when they were weary, some of their pages would blow my sail\n",
      "forward with their breath, while I showed my art by steering starboard or\n",
      "larboard as I pleased.  When I had done, Glumdalclitch always carried\n",
      "back my boat into her closet, and hung it on a nail to dry.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this exercise I once met an accident, which had like to have cost me\n",
      "my life; for, one of the pages having put my boat into the trough, the\n",
      "governess who attended Glumdalclitch very officiously lifted me up, to\n",
      "place me in the boat: but I happened to slip through her fingers, and\n",
      "should infallibly have fallen down forty feet upon the floor, if, by the\n",
      "luckiest chance in the world, I had not been stopped by a corking-pin\n",
      "that stuck in the good gentlewoman’s stomacher; the head of the pin\n",
      "passing between my shirt and the waistband of my breeches, and thus I was\n",
      "held by the middle in the air, till Glumdalclitch ran to my relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another time, one of the servants, whose office it was to fill my trough\n",
      "every third day with fresh water, was so careless as to let a huge frog\n",
      "(not perceiving it) slip out of his pail.  The frog lay concealed till I\n",
      "was put into my boat, but then, seeing a resting-place, climbed up, and\n",
      "made it lean so much on one side, that I was forced to balance it with\n",
      "all my weight on the other, to prevent overturning.  When the frog was\n",
      "got in, it hopped at once half the length of the boat, and then over my\n",
      "head, backward and forward, daubing my face and clothes with its odious\n",
      "slime.  The largeness of its features made it appear the most deformed\n",
      "animal that can be conceived.  However, I desired Glumdalclitch to let me\n",
      "deal with it alone.  I banged it a good while with one of my sculls, and\n",
      "at last forced it to leap out of the boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the greatest danger I ever underwent in that kingdom, was from a\n",
      "monkey, who belonged to one of the clerks of the kitchen.  Glumdalclitch\n",
      "had locked me up in her closet, while she went somewhere upon business,\n",
      "or a visit.  The weather being very warm, the closet-window was left\n",
      "open, as well as the windows and the door of my bigger box, in which I\n",
      "usually lived, because of its largeness and conveniency.  As I sat\n",
      "quietly meditating at my table, I heard something bounce in at the\n",
      "closet-window, and skip about from one side to the other: whereat,\n",
      "although I was much alarmed, yet I ventured to look out, but not stirring\n",
      "from my seat; and then I saw this frolicsome animal frisking and leaping\n",
      "up and down, till at last he came to my box, which he seemed to view with\n",
      "great pleasure and curiosity, peeping in at the door and every window.  I\n",
      "retreated to the farther corner of my room; or box; but the monkey\n",
      "looking in at every side, put me in such a fright, that I wanted presence\n",
      "of mind to conceal myself under the bed, as I might easily have done.\n",
      "After some time spent in peeping, grinning, and chattering, he at last\n",
      "espied me; and reaching one of his paws in at the door, as a cat does\n",
      "when she plays with a mouse, although I often shifted place to avoid him,\n",
      "he at length seized the lappet of my coat (which being made of that\n",
      "country silk, was very thick and strong), and dragged me out.  He took me\n",
      "up in his right fore-foot and held me as a nurse does a child she is\n",
      "going to suckle, just as I have seen the same sort of creature do with a\n",
      "kitten in Europe; and when I offered to struggle he squeezed me so hard,\n",
      "that I thought it more prudent to submit.  I have good reason to believe,\n",
      "that he took me for a young one of his own species, by his often stroking\n",
      "my face very gently with his other paw.  In these diversions he was\n",
      "interrupted by a noise at the closet door, as if somebody were opening\n",
      "it: whereupon he suddenly leaped up to the window at which he had come\n",
      "in, and thence upon the leads and gutters, walking upon three legs, and\n",
      "holding me in the fourth, till he clambered up to a roof that was next to\n",
      "ours.  I heard Glumdalclitch give a shriek at the moment he was carrying\n",
      "me out.  The poor girl was almost distracted: that quarter of the palace\n",
      "was all in an uproar; the servants ran for ladders; the monkey was seen\n",
      "by hundreds in the court, sitting upon the ridge of a building, holding\n",
      "me like a baby in one of his forepaws, and feeding me with the other, by\n",
      "cramming into my mouth some victuals he had squeezed out of the bag on\n",
      "one side of his chaps, and patting me when I would not eat; whereat many\n",
      "of the rabble below could not forbear laughing; neither do I think they\n",
      "justly ought to be blamed, for, without question, the sight was\n",
      "ridiculous enough to every body but myself.  Some of the people threw up\n",
      "stones, hoping to drive the monkey down; but this was strictly forbidden,\n",
      "or else, very probably, my brains had been dashed out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ladders were now applied, and mounted by several men; which the\n",
      "monkey observing, and finding himself almost encompassed, not being able\n",
      "to make speed enough with his three legs, let me drop on a ridge tile,\n",
      "and made his escape.  Here I sat for some time, five hundred yards from\n",
      "the ground, expecting every moment to be blown down by the wind, or to\n",
      "fall by my own giddiness, and come tumbling over and over from the ridge\n",
      "to the eaves; but an honest lad, one of my nurse’s footmen, climbed up,\n",
      "and putting me into his breeches pocket, brought me down safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was almost choked with the filthy stuff the monkey had crammed down my\n",
      "throat: but my dear little nurse picked it out of my mouth with a small\n",
      "needle, and then I fell a-vomiting, which gave me great relief.  Yet I\n",
      "was so weak and bruised in the sides with the squeezes given me by this\n",
      "odious animal, that I was forced to keep my bed a fortnight.  The king,\n",
      "queen, and all the court, sent every day to inquire after my health; and\n",
      "her majesty made me several visits during my sickness.  The monkey was\n",
      "killed, and an order made, that no such animal should be kept about the\n",
      "palace.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I attended the king after my recovery, to return him thanks for his\n",
      "favours, he was pleased to rally me a good deal upon this adventure.  He\n",
      "asked me, “what my thoughts and speculations were, while I lay in the\n",
      "monkey’s paw; how I liked the victuals he gave me; his manner of feeding;\n",
      "and whether the fresh air on the roof had sharpened my stomach.”  He\n",
      "desired to know, “what I would have done upon such an occasion in my own\n",
      "country.”  I told his majesty, “that in Europe we had no monkeys, except\n",
      "such as were brought for curiosity from other places, and so small, that\n",
      "I could deal with a dozen of them together, if they presumed to attack\n",
      "me.  And as for that monstrous animal with whom I was so lately engaged\n",
      "(it was indeed as large as an elephant), if my fears had suffered me to\n",
      "think so far as to make use of my hanger,” (looking fiercely, and\n",
      "clapping my hand on the hilt, as I spoke) “when he poked his paw into my\n",
      "chamber, perhaps I should have given him such a wound, as would have made\n",
      "him glad to withdraw it with more haste than he put it in.”  This I\n",
      "delivered in a firm tone, like a person who was jealous lest his courage\n",
      "should be called in question.  However, my speech produced nothing else\n",
      "beside a laud laughter, which all the respect due to his majesty from\n",
      "those about him could not make them contain.  This made me reflect, how\n",
      "vain an attempt it is for a man to endeavour to do himself honour among\n",
      "those who are out of all degree of equality or comparison with him.  And\n",
      "yet I have seen the moral of my own behaviour very frequent in England\n",
      "since my return; where a little contemptible varlet, without the least\n",
      "title to birth, person, wit, or common sense, shall presume to look with\n",
      "importance, and put himself upon a foot with the greatest persons of the\n",
      "kingdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was every day furnishing the court with some ridiculous story: and\n",
      "Glumdalclitch, although she loved me to excess, yet was arch enough to\n",
      "inform the queen, whenever I committed any folly that she thought would\n",
      "be diverting to her majesty.  The girl, who had been out of order, was\n",
      "carried by her governess to take the air about an hour’s distance, or\n",
      "thirty miles from town.  They alighted out of the coach near a small\n",
      "foot-path in a field, and Glumdalclitch setting down my travelling box, I\n",
      "went out of it to walk.  There was a cow-dung in the path, and I must\n",
      "need try my activity by attempting to leap over it.  I took a run, but\n",
      "unfortunately jumped short, and found myself just in the middle up to my\n",
      "knees.  I waded through with some difficulty, and one of the footmen\n",
      "wiped me as clean as he could with his handkerchief, for I was filthily\n",
      "bemired; and my nurse confined me to my box, till we returned home; where\n",
      "the queen was soon informed of what had passed, and the footmen spread it\n",
      "about the court: so that all the mirth for some days was at my expense.\n",

      "Several contrivances of the author to please the king and queen.  He\n",
      "shows his skill in music.  The king inquires into the state of England,\n",
      "which the author relates to him.  The king’s observations thereon.\n",
      "\n",
      "I used to attend the king’s levee once or twice a week, and had often\n",
      "seen him under the barber’s hand, which indeed was at first very terrible\n",
      "to behold; for the razor was almost twice as long as an ordinary scythe.\n",
      "His majesty, according to the custom of the country, was only shaved\n",
      "twice a-week.  I once prevailed on the barber to give me some of the suds\n",
      "or lather, out of which I picked forty or fifty of the strongest stumps\n",
      "of hair.  I then took a piece of fine wood, and cut it like the back of a\n",
      "comb, making several holes in it at equal distances with as small a\n",
      "needle as I could get from Glumdalclitch.  I fixed in the stumps so\n",
      "artificially, scraping and sloping them with my knife toward the points,\n",
      "that I made a very tolerable comb; which was a seasonable supply, my own\n",
      "being so much broken in the teeth, that it was almost useless: neither\n",
      "did I know any artist in that country so nice and exact, as would\n",
      "undertake to make me another.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this puts me in mind of an amusement, wherein I spent many of my\n",
      "leisure hours.  I desired the queen’s woman to save for me the combings\n",
      "of her majesty’s hair, whereof in time I got a good quantity; and\n",
      "consulting with my friend the cabinet-maker, who had received general\n",
      "orders to do little jobs for me, I directed him to make two chair-frames,\n",
      "no larger than those I had in my box, and to bore little holes with a\n",
      "fine awl, round those parts where I designed the backs and seats; through\n",
      "these holes I wove the strongest hairs I could pick out, just after the\n",
      "manner of cane chairs in England.  When they were finished, I made a\n",
      "present of them to her majesty; who kept them in her cabinet, and used to\n",
      "show them for curiosities, as indeed they were the wonder of every one\n",
      "that beheld them.  The queen would have me sit upon one of these chairs,\n",
      "but I absolutely refused to obey her, protesting I would rather die than\n",
      "place a dishonourable part of my body on those precious hairs, that once\n",
      "adorned her majesty’s head.  Of these hairs (as I had always a mechanical\n",
      "genius) I likewise made a neat little purse, about five feet long, with\n",
      "her majesty’s name deciphered in gold letters, which I gave to\n",
      "Glumdalclitch, by the queen’s consent.  To say the truth, it was more for\n",
      "show than use, being not of strength to bear the weight of the larger\n",
      "coins, and therefore she kept nothing in it but some little toys that\n",
      "girls are fond of.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king, who delighted in music, had frequent concerts at court, to\n",
      "which I was sometimes carried, and set in my box on a table to hear them:\n",
      "but the noise was so great that I could hardly distinguish the tunes.  I\n",
      "am confident that all the drums and trumpets of a royal army, beating and\n",
      "sounding together just at your ears, could not equal it.  My practice was\n",
      "to have my box removed from the place where the performers sat, as far as\n",
      "I could, then to shut the doors and windows of it, and draw the window\n",
      "curtains; after which I found their music not disagreeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had learned in my youth to play a little upon the spinet.\n",
      "Glumdalclitch kept one in her chamber, and a master attended twice a-week\n",
      "to teach her: I called it a spinet, because it somewhat resembled that\n",
      "instrument, and was played upon in the same manner.  A fancy came into my\n",
      "head, that I would entertain the king and queen with an English tune upon\n",
      "this instrument.  But this appeared extremely difficult: for the spinet\n",
      "was near sixty feet long, each key being almost a foot wide, so that with\n",
      "my arms extended I could not reach to above five keys, and to press them\n",
      "down required a good smart stroke with my fist, which would be too great\n",
      "a labour, and to no purpose.  The method I contrived was this: I prepared\n",
      "two round sticks, about the bigness of common cudgels; they were thicker\n",
      "at one end than the other, and I covered the thicker ends with pieces of\n",
      "a mouse’s skin, that by rapping on them I might neither damage the tops\n",
      "of the keys nor interrupt the sound.  Before the spinet a bench was\n",
      "placed, about four feet below the keys, and I was put upon the bench.  I\n",
      "ran sideling upon it, that way and this, as fast as I could, banging the\n",
      "proper keys with my two sticks, and made a shift to play a jig, to the\n",
      "great satisfaction of both their majesties; but it was the most violent\n",
      "exercise I ever underwent; and yet I could not strike above sixteen keys,\n",
      "nor consequently play the bass and treble together, as other artists do;\n",
      "which was a great disadvantage to my performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king, who, as I before observed, was a prince of excellent\n",
      "understanding, would frequently order that I should be brought in my box,\n",
      "and set upon the table in his closet: he would then command me to bring\n",
      "one of my chairs out of the box, and sit down within three yards distance\n",
      "upon the top of the cabinet, which brought me almost to a level with his\n",
      "face.  In this manner I had several conversations with him.  I one day\n",
      "took the freedom to tell his majesty, “that the contempt he discovered\n",
      "towards Europe, and the rest of the world, did not seem answerable to\n",
      "those excellent qualities of mind that he was master of; that reason did\n",
      "not extend itself with the bulk of the body; on the contrary, we observed\n",
      "in our country, that the tallest persons were usually the least provided\n",
      "with it; that among other animals, bees and ants had the reputation of\n",

      "iron, according to its bigness, would drive a ball of iron or lead, with\n",
      "such violence and speed, as nothing was able to sustain its force.  That\n",

      "an army at once, but batter the strongest walls to the ground, sink down\n",
      "ships, with a thousand men in each, to the bottom of the sea, and when\n",
      "linked together by a chain, would cut through masts and rigging, divide\n",
      "hundreds of bodies in the middle, and lay all waste before them.  That we\n",
      "often put this powder into large hollow balls of iron, and discharged\n",

      "Their style is clear, masculine, and smooth, but not florid; for they\n",
      "avoid nothing more than multiplying unnecessary words, or using various\n",
      "expressions.  I have perused many of their books, especially those in\n",
      "history and morality.  Among the rest, I was much diverted with a little\n",
      "old treatise, which always lay in Glumdalclitch’s bed chamber, and\n",
      "belonged to her governess, a grave elderly gentlewoman, who dealt in\n",
      "writings of morality and devotion.  The book treats of the weakness of\n",
      "human kind, and is in little esteem, except among the women and the\n",
      "vulgar.  However, I was curious to see what an author of that country\n",
      "could say upon such a subject.  This writer went through all the usual\n",
      "topics of European moralists, showing “how diminutive, contemptible, and\n",
      "helpless an animal was man in his own nature; how unable to defend\n",
      "himself from inclemencies of the air, or the fury of wild beasts: how\n",
      "much he was excelled by one creature in strength, by another in speed, by\n",
      "a third in foresight, by a fourth in industry.”  He added, “that nature\n",
      "was degenerated in these latter declining ages of the world, and could\n",
      "now produce only small abortive births, in comparison of those in ancient\n",
      "times.”  He said “it was very reasonable to think, not only that the\n",
      "species of men were originally much larger, but also that there must have\n",
      "been giants in former ages; which, as it is asserted by history and\n",
      "tradition, so it has been confirmed by huge bones and skulls, casually\n",
      "dug up in several parts of the kingdom, far exceeding the common dwindled\n",
      "race of men in our days.”  He argued, “that the very laws of nature\n",
      "absolutely required we should have been made, in the beginning of a size\n",
      "more large and robust; not so liable to destruction from every little\n",
      "accident, of a tile falling from a house, or a stone cast from the hand\n",
      "of a boy, or being drowned in a little brook.”  From this way of\n",
      "reasoning, the author drew several moral applications, useful in the\n",
      "conduct of life, but needless here to repeat.  For my own part, I could\n",
      "not avoid reflecting how universally this talent was spread, of drawing\n",
      "lectures in morality, or indeed rather matter of discontent and repining,\n",
      "from the quarrels we raise with nature.  And I believe, upon a strict\n",

      "silken ropes from the four corners at the top, to break the jolts, when a\n",
      "servant carried me before him on horseback, as I sometimes desired; and\n",
      "would often sleep in my hammock, while we were upon the road.  On the\n",
      "roof of my closet, not directly over the middle of the hammock, I ordered\n",
      "the joiner to cut out a hole of a foot square, to give me air in hot\n",

      "When we came to our journey’s end, the king thought proper to pass a few\n",
      "days at a palace he has near Flanflasnic, a city within eighteen English\n",
      "miles of the seaside.  Glumdalclitch and I were much fatigued: I had\n",
      "gotten a small cold, but the poor girl was so ill as to be confined to\n",
      "her chamber.  I longed to see the ocean, which must be the only scene of\n",
      "my escape, if ever it should happen.  I pretended to be worse than I\n",
      "really was, and desired leave to take the fresh air of the sea, with a\n",
      "page, whom I was very fond of, and who had sometimes been trusted with\n",
      "me.  I shall never forget with what unwillingness Glumdalclitch\n",
      "consented, nor the strict charge she gave the page to be careful of me,\n",
      "bursting at the same time into a flood of tears, as if she had some\n",
      "forboding of what was to happen.  The boy took me out in my box, about\n",
      "half an hours walk from the palace, towards the rocks on the sea-shore.\n",
      "I ordered him to set me down, and lifting up one of my sashes, cast many\n",
      "a wistful melancholy look towards the sea.  I found myself not very well,\n",

      "down, to keep out the cold.  I soon fell asleep, and all I can conjecture\n",
      "is, while I slept, the page, thinking no danger could happen, went among\n",
      "the rocks to look for birds’ eggs, having before observed him from my\n",
      "window searching about, and picking up one or two in the clefts.  Be that\n",
      "as it will, I found myself suddenly awaked with a violent pull upon the\n",
      "ring, which was fastened at the top of my box for the conveniency of\n",
      "carriage.  I felt my box raised very high in the air, and then borne\n",
      "forward with prodigious speed.  The first jolt had like to have shaken me\n",
      "out of my hammock, but afterward the motion was easy enough.  I called\n",
      "out several times, as loud as I could raise my voice, but all to no\n",
      "purpose.  I looked towards my windows, and could see nothing but the\n",
      "clouds and sky.  I heard a noise just over my head, like the clapping of\n",
      "wings, and then began to perceive the woful condition I was in; that some\n",
      "eagle had got the ring of my box in his beak, with an intent to let it\n",
      "fall on a rock, like a tortoise in a shell, and then pick out my body,\n",
      "and devour it: for the sagacity and smell of this bird enables him to\n",
      "discover his quarry at a great distance, though better concealed than I\n",
      "could be within a two-inch board.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a little time, I observed the noise and flutter of wings to increase\n",
      "very fast, and my box was tossed up and down, like a sign in a windy day.\n",
      "I heard several bangs or buffets, as I thought given to the eagle (for\n",
      "such I am certain it must have been that held the ring of my box in his\n",
      "beak), and then, all on a sudden, felt myself falling perpendicularly\n",
      "down, for above a minute, but with such incredible swiftness, that I\n",
      "almost lost my breath.  My fall was stopped by a terrible squash, that\n",
      "sounded louder to my ears than the cataract of Niagara; after which, I\n",
      "was quite in the dark for another minute, and then my box began to rise\n",
      "so high, that I could see light from the tops of the windows.  I now\n",
      "perceived I was fallen into the sea.  My box, by the weight of my body,\n",
      "the goods that were in, and the broad plates of iron fixed for strength\n",
      "at the four corners of the top and bottom, floated about five feet deep\n",
      "in water.  I did then, and do now suppose, that the eagle which flew away\n",
      "with my box was pursued by two or three others, and forced to let me\n",
      "drop, while he defended himself against the rest, who hoped to share in\n",
      "the prey.  The plates of iron fastened at the bottom of the box (for\n",
      "those were the strongest) preserved the balance while it fell, and\n",
      "hindered it from being broken on the surface of the water. Every joint of\n",
      "it was well grooved; and the door did not move on hinges, but up and down\n",
      "like a sash, which kept my closet so tight that very little water came\n",
      "in.  I got with much difficulty out of my hammock, having first ventured\n",
      "to draw back the slip-board on the roof already mentioned, contrived on\n",
      "purpose to let in air, for want of which I found myself almost stifled.\n",
      "\n",
      "How often did I then wish myself with my dear Glumdalclitch, from whom\n",

      "nurse, the grief she would suffer for my loss, the displeasure of the\n",
      "queen, and the ruin of her fortune.  Perhaps many travellers have not\n",
      "been under greater difficulties and distress than I was at this juncture,\n",
      "expecting every moment to see my box dashed to pieces, or at least\n",
      "overset by the first violent blast, or rising wave.  A breach in one\n",
      "single pane of glass would have been immediate death: nor could any thing\n",
      "have preserved the windows, but the strong lattice wires placed on the\n",
      "outside, against accidents in travelling.  I saw the water ooze in at\n",
      "several crannies, although the leaks were not considerable, and I\n",
      "endeavoured to stop them as well as I could.  I was not able to lift up\n",
      "the roof of my closet, which otherwise I certainly should have done, and\n",
      "sat on the top of it; where I might at least preserve myself some hours\n",
      "longer, than by being shut up (as I may call it) in the hold.  Or if I\n",
      "escaped these dangers for a day or two, what could I expect but a\n",
      "miserable death of cold and hunger?  I was four hours under these\n",

      "I have already told the reader that there were two strong staples fixed\n",
      "upon that side of my box which had no window, and into which the servant,\n",
      "who used to carry me on horseback, would put a leathern belt, and buckle\n",
      "it about his waist.  Being in this disconsolate state, I heard, or at\n",
      "least thought I heard, some kind of grating noise on that side of my box\n",
      "where the staples were fixed; and soon after I began to fancy that the\n",
      "box was pulled or towed along the sea; for I now and then felt a sort of\n",
      "tugging, which made the waves rise near the tops of my windows, leaving\n",
      "me almost in the dark.  This gave me some faint hopes of relief, although\n",
      "I was not able to imagine how it could be brought about.  I ventured to\n",
      "unscrew one of my chairs, which were always fastened to the floor; and\n",
      "having made a hard shift to screw it down again, directly under the\n",
      "slipping-board that I had lately opened, I mounted on the chair, and\n",
      "putting my mouth as near as I could to the hole, I called for help in a\n",
      "loud voice, and in all the languages I understood.  I then fastened my\n",
      "handkerchief to a stick I usually carried, and thrusting it up the hole,\n",
      "waved it several times in the air, that if any boat or ship were near,\n",
      "the seamen might conjecture some unhappy mortal to be shut up in the box.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found no effect from all I could do, but plainly perceived my closet to\n",
      "be moved along; and in the space of an hour, or better, that side of the\n",
      "box where the staples were, and had no windows, struck against something\n",
      "that was hard.  I apprehended it to be a rock, and found myself tossed\n",
      "more than ever.  I plainly heard a noise upon the cover of my closet,\n",
      "like that of a cable, and the grating of it as it passed through the\n",
      "ring.  I then found myself hoisted up, by degrees, at least three feet\n",
      "higher than I was before.  Whereupon I again thrust up my stick and\n",
      "handkerchief, calling for help till I was almost hoarse.  In return to\n",
      "which, I heard a great shout repeated three times, giving me such\n",
      "transports of joy as are not to be conceived but by those who feel them.\n",
      "I now heard a trampling over my head, and somebody calling through the\n",
      "hole with a loud voice, in the English tongue, “If there be any body\n",
      "below, let them speak.”  I answered, “I was an Englishman, drawn by ill\n",
      "fortune into the greatest calamity that ever any creature underwent, and\n",
      "begged, by all that was moving, to be delivered out of the dungeon I was\n",
      "in.”  The voice replied, “I was safe, for my box was fastened to their\n",

      "one of the crew put his finger into the ring, and take the box out of the\n",
      "sea into the ship, and so into the captain’s cabin.”  Some of them, upon\n",
      "hearing me talk so wildly, thought I was mad: others laughed; for indeed\n",
      "it never came into my head, that I was now got among people of my own\n",
      "stature and strength.  The carpenter came, and in a few minutes sawed a\n",
      "passage about four feet square, then let down a small ladder, upon which\n",
      "I mounted, and thence was taken into the ship in a very weak condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sailors were all in amazement, and asked me a thousand questions,\n",
      "which I had no inclination to answer.  I was equally confounded at the\n",

      "long accustomed mine eyes to the monstrous objects I had left.  But the\n",
      "captain, Mr. Thomas Wilcocks, an honest worthy Shropshire man, observing\n",
      "I was ready to faint, took me into his cabin, gave me a cordial to\n",
      "comfort me, and made me turn in upon his own bed, advising me to take a\n",
      "little rest, of which I had great need.  Before I went to sleep, I gave\n",

      "and a cabinet; that my closet was hung on all sides, or rather quilted,\n",
      "with silk and cotton; that if he would let one of the crew bring my\n",
      "closet into his cabin, I would open it there before him, and show him my\n",
      "goods.  The captain, hearing me utter these absurdities, concluded I was\n",
      "raving; however (I suppose to pacify me) he promised to give order as I\n",
      "desired, and going upon deck, sent some of his men down into my closet,\n",
      "whence (as I afterwards found) they drew up all my goods, and stripped\n",
      "off the quilting; but the chairs, cabinet, and bedstead, being screwed to\n",
      "the floor, were much damaged by the ignorance of the seamen, who tore\n",
      "them up by force.  Then they knocked off some of the boards for the use\n",
      "of the ship, and when they had got all they had a mind for, let the hull\n",
      "drop into the sea, which by reason of many breaches made in the bottom\n",
      "and sides, sunk to rights.  And, indeed, I was glad not to have been a\n",
      "spectator of the havoc they made, because I am confident it would have\n",

      "I slept some hours, but perpetually disturbed with dreams of the place I\n",
      "had left, and the dangers I had escaped.  However, upon waking, I found\n",
      "myself much recovered.  It was now about eight o’clock at night, and the\n",
      "captain ordered supper immediately, thinking I had already fasted too\n",
      "long.  He entertained me with great kindness, observing me not to look\n",
      "wildly, or talk inconsistently: and, when we were left alone, desired I\n",
      "would give him a relation of my travels, and by what accident I came to\n",
      "be set adrift, in that monstrous wooden chest.  He said “that about\n",
      "twelve o’clock at noon, as he was looking through his glass, he spied it\n",
      "at a distance, and thought it was a sail, which he had a mind to make,\n",
      "being not much out of his course, in hopes of buying some biscuit, his\n",
      "own beginning to fall short.  That upon coming nearer, and finding his\n",
      "error, he sent out his long-boat to discover what it was; that his men\n",
      "came back in a fright, swearing they had seen a swimming house.  That he\n",
      "laughed at their folly, and went himself in the boat, ordering his men to\n",
      "take a strong cable along with them.  That the weather being calm, he\n",
      "rowed round me several times, observed my windows and wire lattices that\n",
      "defended them.  That he discovered two staples upon one side, which was\n",
      "all of boards, without any passage for light.  He then commanded his men\n",
      "to row up to that side, and fastening a cable to one of the staples,\n",
      "ordered them to tow my chest, as they called it, toward the ship.  When\n",
      "it was there, he gave directions to fasten another cable to the ring\n",
      "fixed in the cover, and to raise up my chest with pulleys, which all the\n",
      "sailors were not able to do above two or three feet.”  He said, “they saw\n",
      "my stick and handkerchief thrust out of the hole, and concluded that some\n",
      "unhappy man must be shut up in the cavity.”  I asked, “whether he or the\n",
      "crew had seen any prodigious birds in the air, about the time he first\n",
      "discovered me.”  To which he answered, “that discoursing this matter with\n",
      "the sailors while I was asleep, one of them said, he had observed three\n",
      "eagles flying towards the north, but remarked nothing of their being\n",
      "larger than the usual size:” which I suppose must be imputed to the great\n",
      "height they were at; and he could not guess the reason of my question.  I\n",
      "then asked the captain, “how far he reckoned we might be from land?”  He\n",
      "said, “by the best computation he could make, we were at least a hundred\n",
      "leagues.”  I assured him, “that he must be mistaken by almost half, for I\n",
      "had not left the country whence I came above two hours before I dropped\n",
      "into the sea.”  Whereupon he began again to think that my brain was\n",
      "disturbed, of which he gave me a hint, and advised me to go to bed in a\n",
      "cabin he had provided.  I assured him, “I was well refreshed with his\n",
      "good entertainment and company, and as much in my senses as ever I was in\n",
      "my life.”  He then grew serious, and desired to ask me freely, “whether I\n",
      "were not troubled in my mind by the consciousness of some enormous crime,\n",
      "for which I was punished, at the command of some prince, by exposing me\n",

      "worthy gentleman, who had some tincture of learning, and very good sense,\n",
      "was immediately convinced of my candour and veracity.  But further to\n",

      "his own presence, and showed him the small collection of rarities I made\n",
      "in the country from which I had been so strangely delivered.  There was\n",
      "the comb I had contrived out of the stumps of the king’s beard, and\n",
      "another of the same materials, but fixed into a paring of her majesty’s\n",
      "thumb-nail, which served for the back.  There was a collection of needles\n",
      "and pins, from a foot to half a yard long; four wasp stings, like\n",
      "joiner’s tacks; some combings of the queen’s hair; a gold ring, which one\n",

      "the captain would please to accept this ring in return for his\n",
      "civilities; which he absolutely refused.  I showed him a corn that I had\n",
      "cut off with my own hand, from a maid of honour’s toe; it was about the\n",
      "bigness of Kentish pippin, and grown so hard, that when I returned\n",
      "England, I got it hollowed into a cup, and set in silver.  Lastly, I\n",

      "mouse’s skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could force nothing on him but a footman’s tooth, which I observed him\n",

      "deserve.  It was drawn by an unskilful surgeon, in a mistake, from one of\n",
      "Glumdalclitch’s men, who was afflicted with the tooth-ache, but it was as\n",
      "sound as any in his head.  I got it cleaned, and put it into my cabinet.\n",
      "It was about a foot long, and four inches in diameter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The captain was very well satisfied with this plain relation I had given\n",
      "him, and said, “he hoped, when we returned to England, I would oblige the\n",
      "world by putting it on paper, and making it public.”  My answer was,\n",
      "“that we were overstocked with books of travels: that nothing could now\n",
      "pass which was not extraordinary; wherein I doubted some authors less\n",
      "consulted truth, than their own vanity, or interest, or the diversion of\n",
      "ignorant readers; that my story could contain little beside common\n",
      "events, without those ornamental descriptions of strange plants, trees,\n",
      "birds, and other animals; or of the barbarous customs and idolatry of\n",
      "savage people, with which most writers abound.  However, I thanked him\n",
      "for his good opinion, and promised to take the matter into my thoughts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He said “he wondered at one thing very much, which was, to hear me speak\n",
      "so loud;” asking me “whether the king or queen of that country were thick\n",
      "of hearing?”  I told him, “it was what I had been used to for above two\n",
      "years past, and that I admired as much at the voices of him and his men,\n",
      "who seemed to me only to whisper, and yet I could hear them well enough.\n",
      "But, when I spoke in that country, it was like a man talking in the\n",
      "streets, to another looking out from the top of a steeple, unless when I\n",
      "was placed on a table, or held in any person’s hand.”  I told him, “I had\n",
      "likewise observed another thing, that, when I first got into the ship,\n",
      "and the sailors stood all about me, I thought they were the most little\n",
      "contemptible creatures I had ever beheld.”  For indeed, while I was in\n",
      "that prince’s country, I could never endure to look in a glass, after\n",
      "mine eyes had been accustomed to such prodigious objects, because the\n",
      "comparison gave me so despicable a conceit of myself.  The captain said,\n",
      "“that while we were at supper, he observed me to look at every thing with\n",
      "a sort of wonder, and that I often seemed hardly able to contain my\n",
      "laughter, which he knew not well how to take, but imputed it to some\n",
      "disorder in my brain.”  I answered, “it was very true; and I wondered how\n",
      "I could forbear, when I saw his dishes of the size of a silver\n",
      "three-pence, a leg of pork hardly a mouthful, a cup not so big as a\n",
      "nut-shell;” and so I went on, describing the rest of his household-stuff\n",
      "and provisions, after the same manner.  For, although he queen had\n",
      "ordered a little equipage of all things necessary for me, while I was in\n",
      "her service, yet my ideas were wholly taken up with what I saw on every\n",
      "side of me, and I winked at my own littleness, as people do at their own\n",
      "faults.  The captain understood my raillery very well, and merrily\n",
      "replied with the old English proverb, “that he doubted mine eyes were\n",
      "bigger than my belly, for he did not observe my stomach so good, although\n",
      "I had fasted all day;” and, continuing in his mirth, protested “he would\n",
      "have gladly given a hundred pounds, to have seen my closet in the eagle’s\n",
      "bill, and afterwards in its fall from so great a height into the sea;\n",
      "which would certainly have been a most astonishing object, worthy to have\n",
      "the description of it transmitted to future ages:” and the comparison of\n",
      "Phaëton was so obvious, that he could not forbear applying it, although I\n",
      "did not much admire the conceit.\n",

      "The captain having been at Tonquin, was, in his return to England, driven\n",
      "north-eastward to the latitude of 44 degrees, and longitude of 143.  But\n",
      "meeting a trade-wind two days after I came on board him, we sailed\n",
      "southward a long time, and coasting New Holland, kept our course\n",
      "west-south-west, and then south-south-west, till we doubled the Cape of\n",
      "Good Hope.  Our voyage was very prosperous, but I shall not trouble the\n",
      "reader with a journal of it.  The captain called in at one or two ports,\n",
      "and sent in his long-boat for provisions and fresh water; but I never\n",
      "went out of the ship till we came into the Downs, which was on the third\n",
      "day of June, 1706, about nine months after my escape.  I offered to leave\n",
      "my goods in security for payment of my freight: but the captain protested\n",
      "he would not receive one farthing.  We took a kind leave of each other,\n",
      "and I made him promise he would come to see me at my house in Redriff.  I\n",

      "We set out the 5th day of August, 1706, and arrived at Fort St. George\n",

      "many of whom were sick.  From thence we went to Tonquin, where the\n",
      "captain resolved to continue some time, because many of the goods he\n",
      "intended to buy were not ready, nor could he expect to be dispatched in\n",
      "several months.  Therefore, in hopes to defray some of the charges he\n",
      "must be at, he bought a sloop, loaded it with several sorts of goods,\n",

      "\n",
      "We had not sailed above three days, when a great storm arising, we were\n",
      "driven five days to the north-north-east, and then to the east: after\n",
      "which we had fair weather, but still with a pretty strong gale from the\n",
      "west.  Upon the tenth day we were chased by two pirates, who soon\n",
      "overtook us; for my sloop was so deep laden, that she sailed very slow,\n",
      "neither were we in a condition to defend ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were boarded about the same time by both the pirates, who entered\n",
      "furiously at the head of their men; but finding us all prostrate upon our\n",
      "faces (for so I gave order), they pinioned us with strong ropes, and\n",
      "setting guard upon us, went to search the sloop.\n",
      "\n",
      "I observed among them a Dutchman, who seemed to be of some authority,\n",
      "though he was not commander of either ship.  He knew us by our\n",
      "countenances to be Englishmen, and jabbering to us in his own language,\n",
      "swore we should be tied back to back and thrown into the sea.  I spoken\n",
      "Dutch tolerably well; I told him who we were, and begged him, in\n",
      "consideration of our being Christians and Protestants, of neighbouring\n",
      "countries in strict alliance, that he would move the captains to take\n",
      "some pity on us.  This inflamed his rage; he repeated his threatenings,\n",
      "and turning to his companions, spoke with great vehemence in the Japanese\n",
      "language, as I suppose, often using the word _Christianos_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The largest of the two pirate ships was commanded by a Japanese captain,\n",
      "who spoke a little Dutch, but very imperfectly.  He came up to me, and\n",
      "after several questions, which I answered in great humility, he said, “we\n",
      "should not die.”  I made the captain a very low bow, and then, turning to\n",
      "the Dutchman, said, “I was sorry to find more mercy in a heathen, than in\n",
      "a brother christian.”  But I had soon reason to repent those foolish\n",
      "words: for that malicious reprobate, having often endeavoured in vain to\n",
      "persuade both the captains that I might be thrown into the sea (which\n",
      "they would not yield to, after the promise made me that I should not\n",
      "die), however, prevailed so far, as to have a punishment inflicted on me,\n",
      "worse, in all human appearance, than death itself.  My men were sent by\n",
      "an equal division into both the pirate ships, and my sloop new manned.\n",
      "As to myself, it was determined that I should be set adrift in a small\n",
      "canoe, with paddles and a sail, and four days’ provisions; which last,\n",
      "the Japanese captain was so kind to double out of his own stores, and\n",
      "would permit no man to search me.  I got down into the canoe, while the\n",
      "Dutchman, standing upon the deck, loaded me with all the curses and\n",
      "injurious terms his language could afford.\n",
      "\n",
      "About an hour before we saw the pirates I had taken an observation, and\n",
      "found we were in the latitude of 46 N. and longitude of 183.  When I was\n",
      "at some distance from the pirates, I discovered, by my pocket-glass,\n",
      "several islands to the south-east.  I set up my sail, the wind being\n",
      "fair, with a design to reach the nearest of those islands, which I made a\n",
      "shift to do, in about three hours.  It was all rocky: however I got many\n",
      "birds’ eggs; and, striking fire, I kindled some heath and dry sea-weed,\n",
      "by which I roasted my eggs.  I ate no other supper, being resolved to\n",
      "spare my provisions as much as I could.  I passed the night under the\n",
      "shelter of a rock, strewing some heath under me, and slept pretty well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day I sailed to another island, and thence to a third and\n",
      "fourth, sometimes using my sail, and sometimes my paddles.  But, not to\n",
      "trouble the reader with a particular account of my distresses, let it\n",
      "suffice, that on the fifth day I arrived at the last island in my sight,\n",
      "which lay south-south-east to the former.\n",
      "\n",
      "This island was at a greater distance than I expected, and I did not\n",
      "reach it in less than five hours.  I encompassed it almost round, before\n",
      "I could find a convenient place to land in; which was a small creek,\n",
      "about three times the wideness of my canoe.  I found the island to be all\n",
      "rocky, only a little intermingled with tufts of grass, and sweet-smelling\n",
      "herbs.  I took out my small provisions and after having refreshed myself,\n",
      "I secured the remainder in a cave, whereof there were great numbers; I\n",
      "gathered plenty of eggs upon the rocks, and got a quantity of dry\n",
      "sea-weed, and parched grass, which I designed to kindle the next day, and\n",
      "roast my eggs as well as I could, for I had about me my flint, steel,\n",
      "match, and burning-glass.  I lay all night in the cave where I had lodged\n",
      "my provisions.  My bed was the same dry grass and sea-weed which I\n",
      "intended for fuel.  I slept very little, for the disquiets of my mind\n",
      "prevailed over my weariness, and kept me awake.  I considered how\n",
      "impossible it was to preserve my life in so desolate a place, and how\n",
      "miserable my end must be: yet found myself so listless and desponding,\n",
      "that I had not the heart to rise; and before I could get spirits enough\n",
      "to creep out of my cave, the day was far advanced.  I walked awhile among\n",
      "the rocks: the sky was perfectly clear, and the sun so hot, that I was\n",
      "forced to turn my face from it: when all on a sudden it became obscure,\n",
      "as I thought, in a manner very different from what happens by the\n",
      "interposition of a cloud.  I turned back, and perceived a vast opaque\n",
      "body between me and the sun moving forwards towards the island: it seemed\n",
      "to be about two miles high, and hid the sun six or seven minutes; but I\n",
      "did not observe the air to be much colder, or the sky more darkened, than\n",
      "if I had stood under the shade of a mountain.  As it approached nearer\n",
      "over the place where I was, it appeared to be a firm substance, the\n",
      "bottom flat, smooth, and shining very bright, from the reflection of the\n",
      "sea below.  I stood upon a height about two hundred yards from the shore,\n",
      "and saw this vast body descending almost to a parallel with me, at less\n",
      "than an English mile distance.  I took out my pocket perspective, and\n",
      "could plainly discover numbers of people moving up and down the sides of\n",
      "it, which appeared to be sloping; but what those people where doing I was\n",
      "not able to distinguish.\n",
      "\n",
      "The natural love of life gave me some inward motion of joy, and I was\n",
      "ready to entertain a hope that this adventure might, some way or other,\n",
      "help to deliver me from the desolate place and condition I was in.  But\n",
      "at the same time the reader can hardly conceive my astonishment, to\n",
      "behold an island in the air, inhabited by men, who were able (as it\n",
      "should seem) to raise or sink, or put it into progressive motion, as they\n",
      "pleased.  But not being at that time in a disposition to philosophise\n",
      "upon this phenomenon, I rather chose to observe what course the island\n",
      "would take, because it seemed for awhile to stand still.  Yet soon after,\n",
      "it advanced nearer, and I could see the sides of it encompassed with\n",
      "several gradations of galleries, and stairs, at certain intervals, to\n",
      "descend from one to the other.  In the lowest gallery, I beheld some\n",
      "people fishing with long angling rods, and others looking on.  I waved my\n",
      "cap (for my hat was long since worn out) and my handkerchief toward the\n",
      "island; and upon its nearer approach, I called and shouted with the\n",
      "utmost strength of my voice; and then looking circumspectly, I beheld a\n",
      "crowd gather to that side which was most in my view.  I found by their\n",
      "pointing towards me and to each other, that they plainly discovered me,\n",
      "although they made no return to my shouting.  But I could see four or\n",
      "five men running in great haste, up the stairs, to the top of the island,\n",
      "who then disappeared.  I happened rightly to conjecture, that these were\n",
      "sent for orders to some person in authority upon this occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of people increased, and, in less than half all hour, the\n",
      "island was moved and raised in such a manner, that the lowest gallery\n",
      "appeared in a parallel of less then a hundred yards distance from the\n",
      "height where I stood.  I then put myself in the most supplicating\n",
      "posture, and spoke in the humblest accent, but received no answer.  Those\n",
      "who stood nearest over against me, seemed to be persons of distinction,\n",
      "as I supposed by their habit.  They conferred earnestly with each other,\n",
      "looking often upon me.  At length one of them called out in a clear,\n",
      "polite, smooth dialect, not unlike in sound to the Italian: and therefore\n",
      "I returned an answer in that language, hoping at least that the cadence\n",
      "might be more agreeable to his ears.  Although neither of us understood\n",
      "the other, yet my meaning was easily known, for the people saw the\n",
      "distress I was in.\n",
      "\n",
      "They made signs for me to come down from the rock, and go towards the\n",
      "shore, which I accordingly did; and the flying island being raised to a\n",

      "the lowest gallery, with a seat fastened to the bottom, to which I fixed\n",

      "to the right, or the left; one of their eyes turned inward, and the other\n",
      "directly up to the zenith.  Their outward garments were adorned with the\n",
      "figures of suns, moons, and stars; interwoven with those of fiddles,\n",
      "flutes, harps, trumpets, guitars, harpsichords, and many other\n",

      "is likewise employed diligently to attend his master in his walks, and\n",
      "upon occasion to give him a soft flap on his eyes; because he is always\n",
      "so wrapped up in cogitation, that he is in manifest danger of falling\n",

      "It was necessary to give the reader this information, without which he\n",

      "people, as they conducted me up the stairs to the top of the island, and\n",
      "from thence to the royal palace.  While we were ascending, they forgot\n",
      "several times what they were about, and left me to myself, till their\n",
      "memories were again roused by their flappers; for they appeared\n",
      "altogether unmoved by the sight of my foreign habit and countenance, and\n",
      "by the shouts of the vulgar, whose thoughts and minds were more\n",
      "disengaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last we entered the palace, and proceeded into the chamber of\n",
      "presence, where I saw the king seated on his throne, attended on each\n",
      "side by persons of prime quality.  Before the throne, was a large table\n",
      "filled with globes and spheres, and mathematical instruments of all\n",
      "kinds.  His majesty took not the least notice of us, although our\n",
      "entrance was not without sufficient noise, by the concourse of all\n",
      "persons belonging to the court.  But he was then deep in a problem; and\n",
      "we attended at least an hour, before he could solve it.  There stood by\n",
      "him, on each side, a young page with flaps in their hands, and when they\n",
      "saw he was at leisure, one of them gently struck his mouth, and the other\n",
      "his right ear; at which he startled like one awaked on the sudden, and\n",
      "looking towards me and the company I was in, recollected the occasion of\n",
      "our coming, whereof he had been informed before.  He spoke some words,\n",
      "whereupon immediately a young man with a flap came up to my side, and\n",
      "flapped me gently on the right ear; but I made signs, as well as I could,\n",
      "that I had no occasion for such an instrument; which, as I afterwards\n",
      "found, gave his majesty, and the whole court, a very mean opinion of my\n",
      "understanding.  The king, as far as I could conjecture, asked me several\n",
      "questions, and I addressed myself to him in all the languages I had.\n",
      "When it was found I could neither understand nor be understood, I was\n",
      "conducted by his order to an apartment in his palace (this prince being\n",
      "distinguished above all his predecessors for his hospitality to\n",
      "strangers), where two servants were appointed to attend me.  My dinner\n",
      "was brought, and four persons of quality, whom I remembered to have seen\n",
      "very near the king’s person, did me the honour to dine with me.  We had\n",
      "two courses, of three dishes each.  In the first course, there was a\n",
      "shoulder of mutton cut into an equilateral triangle, a piece of beef into\n",
      "a rhomboides, and a pudding into a cycloid.  The second course was two\n",
      "ducks trussed up in the form of fiddles; sausages and puddings resembling\n",
      "flutes and hautboys, and a breast of veal in the shape of a harp.  The\n",
      "servants cut our bread into cones, cylinders, parallelograms, and several\n",
      "other mathematical figures.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we were at dinner, I made bold to ask the names of several things\n",
      "in their language, and those noble persons, by the assistance of their\n",
      "flappers, delighted to give me answers, hoping to raise my admiration of\n",
      "their great abilities if I could be brought to converse with them.  I was\n",
      "soon able to call for bread and drink, or whatever else I wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "After dinner my company withdrew, and a person was sent to me by the\n",
      "king’s order, attended by a flapper.  He brought with him pen, ink, and\n",
      "paper, and three or four books, giving me to understand by signs, that he\n",
      "was sent to teach me the language.  We sat together four hours, in which\n",
      "time I wrote down a great number of words in columns, with the\n",
      "translations over against them; I likewise made a shift to learn several\n",
      "short sentences; for my tutor would order one of my servants to fetch\n",
      "something, to turn about, to make a bow, to sit, or to stand, or walk,\n",
      "and the like.  Then I took down the sentence in writing.  He showed me\n",
      "also, in one of his books, the figures of the sun, moon, and stars, the\n",
      "zodiac, the tropics, and polar circles, together with the denominations\n",
      "of many plains and solids.  He gave me the names and descriptions of all\n",
      "the musical instruments, and the general terms of art in playing on each\n",
      "of them.  After he had left me, I placed all my words, with their\n",
      "interpretations, in alphabetical order.  And thus, in a few days, by the\n",
      "help of a very faithful memory, I got some insight into their language.\n",
      "The word, which I interpret the flying or floating island, is in the\n",
      "original _Laputa_, whereof I could never learn the true etymology.\n",
      "_Lap_, in the old obsolete language, signifies high; and _untuh_, a\n",
      "governor; from which they say, by corruption, was derived _Laputa_, from\n",
      "_Lapuntuh_.  But I do not approve of this derivation, which seems to be a\n",
      "little strained.  I ventured to offer to the learned among them a\n",
      "conjecture of my own, that Laputa was _quasi lap outed_; _lap_,\n",
      "signifying properly, the dancing of the sunbeams in the sea, and _outed_,\n",
      "a wing; which, however, I shall not obtrude, but submit to the judicious\n",

      "clothes.  This operator did his office after a different manner from\n",
      "those of his trade in Europe.  He first took my altitude by a quadrant,\n",
      "and then, with a rule and compasses, described the dimensions and\n",
      "outlines of my whole body, all which he entered upon paper; and in six\n",

      "return him some kind of answers.  His majesty had given orders, that the\n",

      "Lagado, the metropolis of the whole kingdom below, upon the firm earth.\n",
      "It was about ninety leagues distant, and our voyage lasted four days and\n",

      "in the air by the island.  On the second morning, about eleven o’clock,\n",
      "the king himself in person, attended by his nobility, courtiers, and\n",
      "officers, having prepared all their musical instruments, played on them\n",
      "for three hours without intermission, so that I was quite stunned with\n",
      "the noise; neither could I possibly guess the meaning, till my tutor\n",
      "informed me.  He said that, the people of their island had their ears\n",
      "adapted to hear “the music of the spheres, which always played at certain\n",

      "several packthreads were let down, with small weights at the bottom.  On\n",
      "these packthreads the people strung their petitions, which mounted up\n",
      "directly, like the scraps of paper fastened by school boys at the end of\n",

      "the earth, by the continual approaches of the sun towards it, must, in\n",
      "course of time, be absorbed, or swallowed up; that the face of the sun,\n",
      "will, by degrees, be encrusted with its own effluvia, and give no more\n",
      "light to the world; that the earth very narrowly escaped a brush from the\n",
      "tail of the last comet, which would have infallibly reduced it to ashes;\n",
      "and that the next, which they have calculated for one-and-thirty years\n",

      "approach within a certain degree of the sun (as by their calculations\n",

      "times more intense than that of red hot glowing iron, and in its absence\n",
      "from the sun, carry a blazing tail ten hundred thousand and fourteen\n",
      "miles long, through which, if the earth should pass at the distance of\n",
      "one hundred thousand miles from the nucleus, or main body of the comet,\n",
      "it must in its passage be set on fire, and reduced to ashes: that the\n",
      "sun, daily spending its rays without any nutriment to supply them, will\n",

      "\n",
      "A phenomenon solved by modern philosophy and astronomy.  The Laputians’\n",
      "great improvements in the latter.  The king’s method of suppressing\n",
      "insurrections.\n",
      "\n",
      "I desired leave of this prince to see the curiosities of the island,\n",
      "which he was graciously pleased to grant, and ordered my tutor to attend\n",
      "me.  I chiefly wanted to know, to what cause, in art or in nature, it\n",
      "owed its several motions, whereof I will now give a philosophical account\n",
      "to the reader.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flying or floating island is exactly circular, its diameter 7837\n",
      "yards, or about four miles and a half, and consequently contains ten\n",
      "thousand acres.  It is three hundred yards thick.  The bottom, or under\n",
      "surface, which appears to those who view it below, is one even regular\n",
      "plate of adamant, shooting up to the height of about two hundred yards.\n",
      "Above it lie the several minerals in their usual order, and over all is a\n",
      "coat of rich mould, ten or twelve feet deep.  The declivity of the upper\n",
      "surface, from the circumference to the centre, is the natural cause why\n",
      "all the dews and rains, which fall upon the island, are conveyed in small\n",
      "rivulets toward the middle, where they are emptied into four large\n",
      "basins, each of about half a mile in circuit, and two hundred yards\n",
      "distant from the centre.  From these basins the water is continually\n",
      "exhaled by the sun in the daytime, which effectually prevents their\n",
      "overflowing.  Besides, as it is in the power of the monarch to raise the\n",
      "island above the region of clouds and vapours, he can prevent the falling\n",
      "of dews and rain whenever he pleases.  For the highest clouds cannot rise\n",
      "above two miles, as naturalists agree, at least they were never known to\n",
      "do so in that country.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the centre of the island there is a chasm about fifty yards in\n",
      "diameter, whence the astronomers descend into a large dome, which is\n",
      "therefore called _flandona gagnole_, or the astronomer’s cave, situated\n",
      "at the depth of a hundred yards beneath the upper surface of the adamant.\n",
      "In this cave are twenty lamps continually burning, which, from the\n",
      "reflection of the adamant, cast a strong light into every part.  The\n",
      "place is stored with great variety of sextants, quadrants, telescopes,\n",
      "astrolabes, and other astronomical instruments.  But the greatest\n",
      "curiosity, upon which the fate of the island depends, is a loadstone of a\n",
      "prodigious size, in shape resembling a weaver’s shuttle.  It is in length\n",
      "six yards, and in the thickest part at least three yards over.  This\n",
      "magnet is sustained by a very strong axle of adamant passing through its\n",
      "middle, upon which it plays, and is poised so exactly that the weakest\n",
      "hand can turn it.  It is hooped round with a hollow cylinder of adamant,\n",
      "four feet yards in diameter, placed horizontally, and supported by eight\n",
      "adamantine feet, each six yards high.  In the middle of the concave side,\n",
      "there is a groove twelve inches deep, in which the extremities of the\n",
      "axle are lodged, and turned round as there is occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stone cannot be removed from its place by any force, because the hoop\n",
      "and its feet are one continued piece with that body of adamant which\n",
      "constitutes the bottom of the island.\n",
      "\n",
      "By means of this loadstone, the island is made to rise and fall, and move\n",
      "from one place to another.  For, with respect to that part of the earth\n",
      "over which the monarch presides, the stone is endued at one of its sides\n",
      "with an attractive power, and at the other with a repulsive.  Upon\n",
      "placing the magnet erect, with its attracting end towards the earth, the\n",
      "island descends; but when the repelling extremity points downwards, the\n",
      "island mounts directly upwards.  When the position of the stone is\n",
      "oblique, the motion of the island is so too: for in this magnet, the\n",

      "By this oblique motion, the island is conveyed to different parts of the\n",
      "monarch’s dominions.  To explain the manner of its progress, let _A_ _B_\n",
      "represent a line drawn across the dominions of Balnibarbi, let the line\n",
      "_c_ _d_ represent the loadstone, of which let _d_ be the repelling end,\n",
      "and _c_ the attracting end, the island being over _C_: let the stone be\n",
      "placed in position _c_ _d_, with its repelling end downwards; then the\n",
      "island will be driven upwards obliquely towards _D_.  When it is arrived\n",
      "at _D_, let the stone be turned upon its axle, till its attracting end\n",
      "points towards _E_, and then the island will be carried obliquely towards\n",
      "_E_; where, if the stone be again turned upon its axle till it stands in\n",
      "the position _E_ _F_, with its repelling point downwards, the island will\n",

      "turning the stone, so as to make its repelling extremity to point\n",
      "directly downward.  And thus, by changing the situation of the stone, as\n",
      "often as there is occasion, the island is made to rise and fall by turns\n",
      "in an oblique direction, and by those alternate risings and fallings (the\n",
      "obliquity being not considerable) is conveyed from one part of the\n",
      "dominions to the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it must be observed, that this island cannot move beyond the extent\n",
      "of the dominions below, nor can it rise above the height of four miles.\n",
      "For which the astronomers (who have written large systems concerning the\n",
      "stone) assign the following reason: that the magnetic virtue does not\n",
      "extend beyond the distance of four miles, and that the mineral, which\n",
      "acts upon the stone in the bowels of the earth, and in the sea about six\n",
      "leagues distant from the shore, is not diffused through the whole globe,\n",
      "but terminated with the limits of the king’s dominions; and it was easy,\n",
      "from the great advantage of such a superior situation, for a prince to\n",
      "bring under his obedience whatever country lay within the attraction of\n",
      "that magnet.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the stone is put parallel to the plane of the horizon, the island\n",
      "stands still; for in that case the extremities of it, being at equal\n",
      "distance from the earth, act with equal force, the one in drawing\n",
      "downwards, the other in pushing upwards, and consequently no motion can\n",
      "ensue.\n",
      "\n",
      "This loadstone is under the care of certain astronomers, who, from time\n",
      "to time, give it such positions as the monarch directs.  They spend the\n",
      "greatest part of their lives in observing the celestial bodies, which\n",
      "they do by the assistance of glasses, far excelling ours in goodness.\n",
      "For, although their largest telescopes do not exceed three feet, they\n",
      "magnify much more than those of a hundred with us, and show the stars\n",
      "with greater clearness.  This advantage has enabled them to extend their\n",
      "discoveries much further than our astronomers in Europe; for they have\n",
      "made a catalogue of ten thousand fixed stars, whereas the largest of ours\n",
      "do not contain above one third part of that number.  They have likewise\n",
      "discovered two lesser stars, or satellites, which revolve about Mars;\n",
      "whereof the innermost is distant from the centre of the primary planet\n",
      "exactly three of his diameters, and the outermost, five; the former\n",
      "revolves in the space of ten hours, and the latter in twenty-one and a\n",
      "half; so that the squares of their periodical times are very near in the\n",
      "same proportion with the cubes of their distance from the centre of Mars;\n",
      "which evidently shows them to be governed by the same law of gravitation\n",
      "that influences the other heavenly bodies.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have observed ninety-three different comets, and settled their\n",
      "periods with great exactness.  If this be true (and they affirm it with\n",
      "great confidence) it is much to be wished, that their observations were\n",
      "made public, whereby the theory of comets, which at present is very lame\n",

      "The king would be the most absolute prince in the universe, if he could\n",
      "but prevail on a ministry to join with him; but these having their\n",
      "estates below on the continent, and considering that the office of a\n",
      "favourite has a very uncertain tenure, would never consent to the\n",
      "enslaving of their country.\n",
      "\n",
      "If any town should engage in rebellion or mutiny, fall into violent\n",
      "factions, or refuse to pay the usual tribute, the king has two methods of\n",
      "reducing them to obedience.  The first and the mildest course is, by\n",
      "keeping the island hovering over such a town, and the lands about it,\n",
      "whereby he can deprive them of the benefit of the sun and the rain, and\n",
      "consequently afflict the inhabitants with dearth and diseases: and if the\n",
      "crime deserve it, they are at the same time pelted from above with great\n",
      "stones, against which they have no defence but by creeping into cellars\n",
      "or caves, while the roofs of their houses are beaten to pieces.  But if\n",
      "they still continue obstinate, or offer to raise insurrections, he\n",
      "proceeds to the last remedy, by letting the island drop directly upon\n",
      "their heads, which makes a universal destruction both of houses and men.\n",
      "However, this is an extremity to which the prince is seldom driven,\n",
      "neither indeed is he willing to put it in execution; nor dare his\n",
      "ministers advise him to an action, which, as it would render them odious\n",
      "to the people, so it would be a great damage to their own estates, which\n",
      "all lie below; for the island is the king’s demesne.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is still indeed a more weighty reason, why the kings of this\n",
      "country have been always averse from executing so terrible an action,\n",
      "unless upon the utmost necessity.  For, if the town intended to be\n",
      "destroyed should have in it any tall rocks, as it generally falls out in\n",
      "the larger cities, a situation probably chosen at first with a view to\n",
      "prevent such a catastrophe; or if it abound in high spires, or pillars of\n",
      "stone, a sudden fall might endanger the bottom or under surface of the\n",
      "island, which, although it consist, as I have said, of one entire\n",
      "adamant, two hundred yards thick, might happen to crack by too great a\n",
      "shock, or burst by approaching too near the fires from the houses below,\n",
      "as the backs, both of iron and stone, will often do in our chimneys.  Of\n",
      "all this the people are well apprised, and understand how far to carry\n",
      "their obstinacy, where their liberty or property is concerned.  And the\n",
      "king, when he is highest provoked, and most determined to press a city to\n",
      "rubbish, orders the island to descend with great gentleness, out of a\n",
      "pretence of tenderness to his people, but, indeed, for fear of breaking\n",
      "the adamantine bottom; in which case, it is the opinion of all their\n",
      "philosophers, that the loadstone could no longer hold it up, and the\n",
      "whole mass would fall to the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "By a fundamental law of this realm, neither the king, nor either of his\n",

      "that lord.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I cannot say that I was ill treated in this island, yet I must\n",
      "confess I thought myself too much neglected, not without some degree of\n",
      "contempt; for neither prince nor people appeared to be curious in any\n",
      "part of knowledge, except mathematics and music, wherein I was far their\n",
      "inferior, and upon that account very little regarded.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other side, after having seen all the curiosities of the island, I\n",
      "was very desirous to leave it, being heartily weary of those people.\n",
      "They were indeed excellent in two sciences for which I have great esteem,\n",
      "and wherein I am not unversed; but, at the same time, so abstracted and\n",
      "involved in speculation, that I never met with such disagreeable\n",
      "companions.  I conversed only with women, tradesmen, flappers, and\n",
      "court-pages, during two months of my abode there; by which, at last, I\n",
      "rendered myself extremely contemptible; yet these were the only people\n",
      "from whom I could ever receive a reasonable answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had obtained, by hard study, a good degree of knowledge in their\n",
      "language: I was weary of being confined to an island where I received so\n",
      "little countenance, and resolved to leave it with the first opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a great lord at court, nearly related to the king, and for that\n",
      "reason alone used with respect.  He was universally reckoned the most\n",
      "ignorant and stupid person among them.  He had performed many eminent\n",
      "services for the crown, had great natural and acquired parts, adorned\n",
      "with integrity and honour; but so ill an ear for music, that his\n",
      "detractors reported, “he had been often known to beat time in the wrong\n",
      "place;” neither could his tutors, without extreme difficulty, teach him\n",
      "to demonstrate the most easy proposition in the mathematics.  He was\n",
      "pleased to show me many marks of favour, often did me the honour of a\n",
      "visit, desired to be informed in the affairs of Europe, the laws and\n",
      "customs, the manners and learning of the several countries where I had\n",
      "travelled.  He listened to me with great attention, and made very wise\n",
      "observations on all I spoke.  He had two flappers attending him for\n",
      "state, but never made use of them, except at court and in visits of\n",
      "ceremony, and would always command them to withdraw, when we were alone\n",
      "together.\n",
      "\n",
      "I entreated this illustrious person, to intercede in my behalf with his\n",
      "majesty, for leave to depart; which he accordingly did, as he was pleased\n",
      "to tell me, with regret: for indeed he had made me several offers very\n",
      "advantageous, which, however, I refused, with expressions of the highest\n",
      "acknowledgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the 16th of February I took leave of his majesty and the court.  The\n",
      "king made me a present to the value of about two hundred pounds English,\n",
      "and my protector, his kinsman, as much more, together with a letter of\n",
      "recommendation to a friend of his in Lagado, the metropolis.  The island\n",
      "being then hovering over a mountain about two miles from it, I was let\n",
      "down from the lowest gallery, in the same manner as I had been taken up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The continent, as far as it is subject to the monarch of the flying\n",
      "island, passes under the general name of _Balnibarbi_; and the\n",
      "metropolis, as I said before, is called _Lagado_.  I felt some little\n",
      "satisfaction in finding myself on firm ground.  I walked to the city\n",
      "without any concern, being clad like one of the natives, and sufficiently\n",
      "instructed to converse with them.  I soon found out the person’s house to\n",
      "whom I was recommended, presented my letter from his friend the grandee\n",
      "in the island, and was received with much kindness.  This great lord,\n",
      "whose name was Munodi, ordered me an apartment in his own house, where I\n",
      "continued during my stay, and was entertained in a most hospitable\n",
      "manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning after my arrival, he took me in his chariot to see the\n",
      "town, which is about half the bigness of London; but the houses very\n",
      "strangely built, and most of them out of repair.  The people in the\n",
      "streets walked fast, looked wild, their eyes fixed, and were generally in\n",
      "rags.  We passed through one of the town gates, and went about three\n",
      "miles into the country, where I saw many labourers working with several\n",
      "sorts of tools in the ground, but was not able to conjecture what they\n",
      "were about: neither did observe any expectation either of corn or grass,\n",
      "although the soil appeared to be excellent.  I could not forbear admiring\n",
      "at these odd appearances, both in town and country; and I made bold to\n",
      "desire my conductor, that he would be pleased to explain to me, what\n",
      "could be meant by so many busy heads, hands, and faces, both in the\n",
      "streets and the fields, because I did not discover any good effects they\n",
      "produced; but, on the contrary, I never knew a soil so unhappily\n",
      "cultivated, houses so ill contrived and so ruinous, or a people whose\n",
      "countenances and habit expressed so much misery and want.\n",
      "\n",
      "This lord Munodi was a person of the first rank, and had been some years\n",
      "governor of Lagado; but, by a cabal of ministers, was discharged for\n",
      "insufficiency.  However, the king treated him with tenderness, as a\n",
      "well-meaning man, but of a low contemptible understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I gave that free censure of the country and its inhabitants, he made\n",
      "no further answer than by telling me, “that I had not been long enough\n",
      "among them to form a judgment; and that the different nations of the\n",
      "world had different customs;” with other common topics to the same\n",
      "purpose.  But, when we returned to his palace, he asked me “how I liked\n",
      "the building, what absurdities I observed, and what quarrel I had with\n",
      "the dress or looks of his domestics?”  This he might safely do; because\n",
      "every thing about him was magnificent, regular, and polite.  I answered,\n",
      "“that his excellency’s prudence, quality, and fortune, had exempted him\n",
      "from those defects, which folly and beggary had produced in others.”  He\n",
      "said, “if I would go with him to his country-house, about twenty miles\n",
      "distant, where his estate lay, there would be more leisure for this kind\n",
      "of conversation.”  I told his excellency “that I was entirely at his\n",
      "disposal;” and accordingly we set out next morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "During our journey he made me observe the several methods used by farmers\n",
      "in managing their lands, which to me were wholly unaccountable; for,\n",
      "except in some very few places, I could not discover one ear of corn or\n",
      "blade of grass.  But, in three hours travelling, the scene was wholly\n",
      "altered; we came into a most beautiful country; farmers’ houses, at small\n",
      "distances, neatly built; the fields enclosed, containing vineyards,\n",
      "corn-grounds, and meadows.  Neither do I remember to have seen a more\n",
      "delightful prospect.  His excellency observed my countenance to clear up;\n",
      "he told me, with a sigh, “that there his estate began, and would continue\n",
      "the same, till we should come to his house: that his countrymen ridiculed\n",
      "and despised him, for managing his affairs no better, and for setting so\n",
      "ill an example to the kingdom; which, however, was followed by very few,\n",
      "such as were old, and wilful, and weak like himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We came at length to the house, which was indeed a noble structure, built\n",
      "according to the best rules of ancient architecture.  The fountains,\n",
      "gardens, walks, avenues, and groves, were all disposed with exact\n",
      "judgment and taste.  I gave due praises to every thing I saw, whereof his\n",
      "excellency took not the least notice till after supper; when, there being\n",
      "no third companion, he told me with a very melancholy air “that he\n",
      "doubted he must throw down his houses in town and country, to rebuild\n",
      "them after the present mode; destroy all his plantations, and cast others\n",
      "into such a form as modern usage required, and give the same directions\n",
      "to all his tenants, unless he would submit to incur the censure of pride,\n",
      "singularity, affectation, ignorance, caprice, and perhaps increase his\n",
      "majesty’s displeasure; that the admiration I appeared to be under would\n",
      "cease or diminish, when he had informed me of some particulars which,\n",
      "probably, I never heard of at court, the people there being too much\n",
      "taken up in their own speculations, to have regard to what passed here\n",
      "below.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The sum of his discourse was to this effect: “That about forty years ago,\n",
      "certain persons went up to Laputa, either upon business or diversion,\n",
      "and, after five months continuance, came back with a very little\n",
      "smattering in mathematics, but full of volatile spirits acquired in that\n",
      "airy region: that these persons, upon their return, began to dislike the\n",
      "management of every thing below, and fell into schemes of putting all\n",
      "arts, sciences, languages, and mechanics, upon a new foot.  To this end,\n",
      "they procured a royal patent for erecting an academy of projectors in\n",
      "Lagado; and the humour prevailed so strongly among the people, that there\n",
      "is not a town of any consequence in the kingdom without such an academy.\n",
      "In these colleges the professors contrive new rules and methods of\n",
      "agriculture and building, and new instruments, and tools for all trades\n",
      "and manufactures; whereby, as they undertake, one man shall do the work\n",
      "of ten; a palace may be built in a week, of materials so durable as to\n",
      "last for ever without repairing.  All the fruits of the earth shall come\n",
      "to maturity at whatever season we think fit to choose, and increase a\n",
      "hundred fold more than they do at present; with innumerable other happy\n",
      "proposals.  The only inconvenience is, that none of these projects are\n",
      "yet brought to perfection; and in the mean time, the whole country lies\n",
      "miserably waste, the houses in ruins, and the people without food or\n",
      "clothes.  By all which, instead of being discouraged, they are fifty\n",
      "times more violently bent upon prosecuting their schemes, driven equally\n",
      "on by hope and despair: that as for himself, being not of an enterprising\n",
      "spirit, he was content to go on in the old forms, to live in the houses\n",
      "his ancestors had built, and act as they did, in every part of life,\n",
      "without innovation: that some few other persons of quality and gentry had\n",
      "done the same, but were looked on with an eye of contempt and ill-will,\n",
      "as enemies to art, ignorant, and ill common-wealth’s men, preferring\n",
      "their own ease and sloth before the general improvement of their\n",

      "observe a ruined building, upon the side of a mountain about three miles\n",
      "distant, of which he gave me this account: “That he had a very convenient\n",
      "mill within half a mile of his house, turned by a current from a large\n",
      "river, and sufficient for his own family, as well as a great number of\n",
      "his tenants; that about seven years ago, a club of those projectors came\n",
      "to him with proposals to destroy this mill, and build another on the side\n",
      "of that mountain, on the long ridge whereof a long canal must be cut, for\n",
      "a repository of water, to be conveyed up by pipes and engines to supply\n",
      "the mill, because the wind and air upon a height agitated the water, and\n",
      "thereby made it fitter for motion, and because the water, descending down\n",
      "a declivity, would turn the mill with half the current of a river whose\n",
      "course is more upon a level.”  He said, “that being then not very well\n",
      "with the court, and pressed by many of his friends, he complied with the\n",
      "proposal; and after employing a hundred men for two years, the work\n",
      "miscarried, the projectors went off, laying the blame entirely upon him,\n",

      "bad character he had in the academy, would not go with me himself, but\n",
      "recommended me to a friend of his, to bear me company thither.  My lord\n",

      "projector of this cell was the most ancient student of the academy; his\n",
      "face and beard were of a pale yellow; his hands and clothes daubed over\n",
      "with filth.  When I was presented to him, he gave me a close embrace, a\n",
      "compliment I could well have excused.  His employment, from his first\n",
      "coming into the academy, was an operation to reduce human excrement to\n",
      "its original food, by separating the several parts, removing the tincture\n",
      "which it receives from the gall, making the odour exhale, and scumming\n",
      "off the saliva.  He had a weekly allowance, from the society, of a vessel\n",
      "filled with human ordure, about the bigness of a Bristol barrel.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw another at work to calcine ice into gunpowder; who likewise showed\n",
      "me a treatise he had written concerning the malleability of fire, which\n",
      "he intended to publish.\n",

      "There was a most ingenious architect, who had contrived a new method for\n",
      "building houses, by beginning at the roof, and working downward to the\n",
      "foundation; which he justified to me, by the like practice of those two\n",
      "prudent insects, the bee and the spider.\n",

      "There was a man born blind, who had several apprentices in his own\n",
      "condition: their employment was to mix colours for painters, which their\n",
      "master taught them to distinguish by feeling and smelling.  It was indeed\n",
      "my misfortune to find them at that time not very perfect in their\n",
      "lessons, and the professor himself happened to be generally mistaken.\n",
      "This artist is much encouraged and esteemed by the whole fraternity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another apartment I was highly pleased with a projector who had found\n",
      "a device of ploughing the ground with hogs, to save the charges of\n",
      "ploughs, cattle, and labour.  The method is this: in an acre of ground\n",
      "you bury, at six inches distance and eight deep, a quantity of acorns,\n",
      "dates, chestnuts, and other mast or vegetables, whereof these animals are\n",
      "fondest; then you drive six hundred or more of them into the field,\n",
      "where, in a few days, they will root up the whole ground in search of\n",
      "their food, and make it fit for sowing, at the same time manuring it with\n",
      "their dung: it is true, upon experiment, they found the charge and\n",
      "trouble very great, and they had little or no crop.  However it is not\n",
      "doubted, that this invention may be capable of great improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went into another room, where the walls and ceiling were all hung round\n",
      "with cobwebs, except a narrow passage for the artist to go in and out.\n",
      "At my entrance, he called aloud to me, “not to disturb his webs.”  He\n",
      "lamented “the fatal mistake the world had been so long in, of using\n",
      "silkworms, while we had such plenty of domestic insects who infinitely\n",
      "excelled the former, because they understood how to weave, as well as\n",
      "spin.”  And he proposed further, “that by employing spiders, the charge\n",
      "of dyeing silks should be wholly saved;” whereof I was fully convinced,\n",
      "when he showed me a vast number of flies most beautifully coloured,\n",
      "wherewith he fed his spiders, assuring us “that the webs would take a\n",
      "tincture from them; and as he had them of all hues, he hoped to fit\n",
      "everybody’s fancy, as soon as he could find proper food for the flies, of\n",
      "certain gums, oils, and other glutinous matter, to give a strength and\n",
      "consistence to the threads.”\n",

      "There was an astronomer, who had undertaken to place a sun-dial upon the\n",

      "I was complaining of a small fit of the colic, upon which my conductor\n",

      "curing that disease, by contrary operations from the same instrument.  He\n",
      "had a large pair of bellows, with a long slender muzzle of ivory: this he\n",
      "conveyed eight inches up the anus, and drawing in the wind, he affirmed\n",
      "he could make the guts as lank as a dried bladder.  But when the disease\n",
      "was more stubborn and violent, he let in the muzzle while the bellows\n",
      "were full of wind, which he discharged into the body of the patient; then\n",
      "withdrew the instrument to replenish it, clapping his thumb strongly\n",
      "against the orifice of then fundament; and this being repeated three or\n",
      "four times, the adventitious wind would rush out, bringing the noxious\n",
      "along with it, (like water put into a pump), and the patient recovered.\n",
      "I saw him try both experiments upon a dog, but could not discern any\n",
      "effect from the former.  After the latter the animal was ready to burst,\n",
      "and made so violent a discharge as was very offensive to me and my\n",

      "I had hitherto seen only one side of the academy, the other being\n",
      "appropriated to the advancers of speculative learning, of whom I shall\n",
      "say something, when I have mentioned one illustrious person more, who is\n",
      "called among them “the universal artist.”  He told us “he had been thirty\n",
      "years employing his thoughts for the improvement of human life.”  He had\n",
      "two large rooms full of wonderful curiosities, and fifty men at work.\n",
      "Some were condensing air into a dry tangible substance, by extracting the\n",
      "nitre, and letting the aqueous or fluid particles percolate; others\n",
      "softening marble, for pillows and pin-cushions; others petrifying the\n",
      "hoofs of a living horse, to preserve them from foundering.  The artist\n",
      "himself was at that time busy upon two great designs; the first, to sow\n",
      "land with chaff, wherein he affirmed the true seminal virtue to be\n",
      "contained, as he demonstrated by several experiments, which I was not\n",
      "skilful enough to comprehend.  The other was, by a certain composition of\n",
      "gums, minerals, and vegetables, outwardly applied, to prevent the growth\n",
      "of wool upon two young lambs; and he hoped, in a reasonable time to\n",
      "propagate the breed of naked sheep, all over the kingdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "We crossed a walk to the other part of the academy, where, as I have\n",
      "already said, the projectors in speculative learning resided.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first professor I saw, was in a very large room, with forty pupils\n",
      "about him.  After salutation, observing me to look earnestly upon a\n",
      "frame, which took up the greatest part of both the length and breadth of\n",
      "the room, he said, “Perhaps I might wonder to see him employed in a\n",
      "project for improving speculative knowledge, by practical and mechanical\n",
      "operations.  But the world would soon be sensible of its usefulness; and\n",
      "he flattered himself, that a more noble, exalted thought never sprang in\n",
      "any other man’s head.  Every one knew how laborious the usual method is\n",
      "of attaining to arts and sciences; whereas, by his contrivance, the most\n",
      "ignorant person, at a reasonable charge, and with a little bodily labour,\n",
      "might write books in philosophy, poetry, politics, laws, mathematics, and\n",
      "theology, without the least assistance from genius or study.”  He then\n",
      "led me to the frame, about the sides, whereof all his pupils stood in\n",
      "ranks.  It was twenty feet square, placed in the middle of the room.  The\n",
      "superfices was composed of several bits of wood, about the bigness of a\n",
      "die, but some larger than others.  They were all linked together by\n",
      "slender wires.  These bits of wood were covered, on every square, with\n",
      "paper pasted on them; and on these papers were written all the words of\n",
      "their language, in their several moods, tenses, and declensions; but\n",
      "without any order.  The professor then desired me “to observe; for he was\n",
      "going to set his engine at work.”  The pupils, at his command, took each\n",
      "of them hold of an iron handle, whereof there were forty fixed round the\n",
      "edges of the frame; and giving them a sudden turn, the whole disposition\n",
      "of the words was entirely changed.  He then commanded six-and-thirty of\n",
      "the lads, to read the several lines softly, as they appeared upon the\n",
      "frame; and where they found three or four words together that might make\n",
      "part of a sentence, they dictated to the four remaining boys, who were\n",
      "scribes.  This work was repeated three or four times, and at every turn,\n",
      "the engine was so contrived, that the words shifted into new places, as\n",
      "the square bits of wood moved upside down.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Picture: The frame]\n",
      "\n",
      "Six hours a day the young students were employed in this labour; and the\n",
      "professor showed me several volumes in large folio, already collected, of\n",
      "broken sentences, which he intended to piece together, and out of those\n",
      "rich materials, to give the world a complete body of all arts and\n",
      "sciences; which, however, might be still improved, and much expedited, if\n",
      "the public would raise a fund for making and employing five hundred such\n",
      "frames in Lagado, and oblige the managers to contribute in common their\n",
      "several collections.\n",
      "\n",
      "He assured me “that this invention had employed all his thoughts from his\n",
      "youth; that he had emptied the whole vocabulary into his frame, and made\n",
      "the strictest computation of the general proportion there is in books\n",
      "between the numbers of particles, nouns, and verbs, and other parts of\n",
      "speech.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I made my humblest acknowledgment to this illustrious person, for his\n",
      "great communicativeness; and promised, “if ever I had the good fortune to\n",
      "return to my native country, that I would do him justice, as the sole\n",
      "inventor of this wonderful machine;” the form and contrivance of which I\n",
      "desired leave to delineate on paper, as in the figure here annexed.  I\n",
      "told him, “although it were the custom of our learned in Europe to steal\n",
      "inventions from each other, who had thereby at least this advantage, that\n",
      "it became a controversy which was the right owner; yet I would take such\n",
      "caution, that he should have the honour entire, without a rival.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We next went to the school of languages, where three professors sat in\n",
      "consultation upon improving that of their own country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first project was, to shorten discourse, by cutting polysyllables\n",
      "into one, and leaving out verbs and participles, because, in reality, all\n",
      "things imaginable are but norms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other project was, a scheme for entirely abolishing all words\n",
      "whatsoever; and this was urged as a great advantage in point of health,\n",
      "as well as brevity.  For it is plain, that every word we speak is, in\n",
      "some degree, a diminution of our lunge by corrosion, and, consequently,\n",
      "contributes to the shortening of our lives.  An expedient was therefore\n",
      "offered, “that since words are only names for things, it would be more\n",
      "convenient for all men to carry about them such things as were necessary\n",
      "to express a particular business they are to discourse on.”  And this\n",
      "invention would certainly have taken place, to the great ease as well as\n",
      "health of the subject, if the women, in conjunction with the vulgar and\n",
      "illiterate, had not threatened to raise a rebellion unless they might be\n",
      "allowed the liberty to speak with their tongues, after the manner of\n",
      "their forefathers; such constant irreconcilable enemies to science are\n",
      "the common people.  However, many of the most learned and wise adhere to\n",
      "the new scheme of expressing themselves by things; which has only this\n",
      "inconvenience attending it, that if a man’s business be very great, and\n",
      "of various kinds, he must be obliged, in proportion, to carry a greater\n",
      "bundle of things upon his back, unless he can afford one or two strong\n",
      "servants to attend him.  I have often beheld two of those sages almost\n",
      "sinking under the weight of their packs, like pedlars among us, who, when\n",
      "they met in the street, would lay down their loads, open their sacks, and\n",
      "hold conversation for an hour together; then put up their implements,\n",
      "help each other to resume their burdens, and take their leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for short conversations, a man may carry implements in his pockets,\n",
      "and under his arms, enough to supply him; and in his house, he cannot be\n",
      "at a loss.  Therefore the room where company meet who practise this art,\n",
      "is full of all things, ready at hand, requisite to furnish matter for\n",
      "this kind of artificial converse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another great advantage proposed by this invention was, that it would\n",
      "serve as a universal language, to be understood in all civilised nations,\n",
      "whose goods and utensils are generally of the same kind, or nearly\n",
      "resembling, so that their uses might easily be comprehended.  And thus\n",
      "ambassadors would be qualified to treat with foreign princes, or\n",
      "ministers of state, to whose tongues they were utter strangers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was at the mathematical school, where the master taught his pupils\n",
      "after a method scarce imaginable to us in Europe.  The proposition, and\n",
      "demonstration, were fairly written on a thin wafer, with ink composed of\n",
      "a cephalic tincture.  This, the student was to swallow upon a fasting\n",
      "stomach, and for three days following, eat nothing but bread and water.\n",
      "As the wafer digested, the tincture mounted to his brain, bearing the\n",
      "proposition along with it.  But the success has not hitherto been\n",
      "answerable, partly by some error in the _quantum_ or composition, and\n",
      "partly by the perverseness of lads, to whom this bolus is so nauseous,\n",
      "that they generally steal aside, and discharge it upwards, before it can\n",
      "operate; neither have they been yet persuaded to use so long an\n",
      "abstinence, as the prescription requires.\n",

      "CHAPTER VI.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A further account of the academy.  The author proposes some improvements,\n",
      "which are honourably received.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the school of political projectors, I was but ill entertained; the\n",
      "professors appearing, in my judgment, wholly out of their senses, which\n",
      "is a scene that never fails to make me melancholy.  These unhappy people\n",
      "were proposing schemes for persuading monarchs to choose favourites upon\n",
      "the score of their wisdom, capacity, and virtue; of teaching ministers to\n",
      "consult the public good; of rewarding merit, great abilities, eminent\n",
      "services; of instructing princes to know their true interest, by placing\n",
      "it on the same foundation with that of their people; of choosing for\n",
      "employments persons qualified to exercise them, with many other wild,\n",
      "impossible chimeras, that never entered before into the heart of man to\n",
      "conceive; and confirmed in me the old observation, “that there is nothing\n",
      "so extravagant and irrational, which some philosophers have not\n",
      "maintained for truth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, however, I shall so far do justice to this part of the Academy, as\n",
      "to acknowledge that all of them were not so visionary.  There was a most\n",
      "ingenious doctor, who seemed to be perfectly versed in the whole nature\n",
      "and system of government.  This illustrious person had very usefully\n",
      "employed his studies, in finding out effectual remedies for all diseases\n",
      "and corruptions to which the several kinds of public administration are\n",
      "subject, by the vices or infirmities of those who govern, as well as by\n",
      "the licentiousness of those who are to obey.  For instance: whereas all\n",
      "writers and reasoners have agreed, that there is a strict universal\n",
      "resemblance between the natural and the political body; can there be any\n",
      "thing more evident, than that the health of both must be preserved, and\n",
      "the diseases cured, by the same prescriptions?  It is allowed, that\n",
      "senates and great councils are often troubled with redundant, ebullient,\n",
      "and other peccant humours; with many diseases of the head, and more of\n",
      "the heart; with strong convulsions, with grievous contractions of the\n",
      "nerves and sinews in both hands, but especially the right; with spleen,\n",
      "flatus, vertigos, and deliriums; with scrofulous tumours, full of fetid\n",
      "purulent matter; with sour frothy ructations: with canine appetites, and\n",
      "crudeness of digestion, besides many others, needless to mention.  This\n",
      "doctor therefore proposed, “that upon the meeting of the senate, certain\n",
      "physicians should attend it the three first days of their sitting, and at\n",
      "the close of each day’s debate feel the pulses of every senator; after\n",
      "which, having maturely considered and consulted upon the nature of the\n",
      "several maladies, and the methods of cure, they should on the fourth day\n",
      "return to the senate house, attended by their apothecaries stored with\n",
      "proper medicines; and before the members sat, administer to each of them\n",
      "lenitives, aperitives, abstersives, corrosives, restringents,\n",
      "palliatives, laxatives, cephalalgics, icterics, apophlegmatics,\n",
      "acoustics, as their several cases required; and, according as these\n",
      "medicines should operate, repeat, alter, or omit them, at the next\n",
      "meeting.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This project could not be of any great expense to the public; and might\n",
      "in my poor opinion, be of much use for the despatch of business, in those\n",
      "countries where senates have any share in the legislative power; beget\n",
      "unanimity, shorten debates, open a few mouths which are now closed, and\n",
      "close many more which are now open; curb the petulancy of the young, and\n",
      "correct the positiveness of the old; rouse the stupid, and damp the pert.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again: because it is a general complaint, that the favourites of princes\n",
      "are troubled with short and weak memories; the same doctor proposed,\n",
      "“that whoever attended a first minister, after having told his business,\n",
      "with the utmost brevity and in the plainest words, should, at his\n",
      "departure, give the said minister a tweak by the nose, or a kick in the\n",
      "belly, or tread on his corns, or lug him thrice by both ears, or run a\n",
      "pin into his breech; or pinch his arm black and blue, to prevent\n",
      "forgetfulness; and at every levee day, repeat the same operation, till\n",
      "the business were done, or absolutely refused.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He likewise directed, “that every senator in the great council of a\n",
      "nation, after he had delivered his opinion, and argued in the defence of\n",
      "it, should be obliged to give his vote directly contrary; because if that\n",
      "were done, the result would infallibly terminate in the good of the\n",
      "public.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When parties in a state are violent, he offered a wonderful contrivance\n",
      "to reconcile them.  The method is this: You take a hundred leaders of\n",
      "each party; you dispose them into couples of such whose heads are nearest\n",
      "of a size; then let two nice operators saw off the occiput of each couple\n",
      "at the same time, in such a manner that the brain may be equally divided.\n",
      "Let the occiputs, thus cut off, be interchanged, applying each to the\n",
      "head of his opposite party-man.  It seems indeed to be a work that\n",
      "requires some exactness, but the professor assured us, “that if it were\n",
      "dexterously performed, the cure would be infallible.”  For he argued\n",
      "thus: “that the two half brains being left to debate the matter between\n",
      "themselves within the space of one skull, would soon come to a good\n",
      "understanding, and produce that moderation, as well as regularity of\n",
      "thinking, so much to be wished for in the heads of those, who imagine\n",
      "they come into the world only to watch and govern its motion: and as to\n",
      "the difference of brains, in quantity or quality, among those who are\n",
      "directors in faction, the doctor assured us, from his own knowledge, that\n",
      "“it was a perfect trifle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I heard a very warm debate between two professors, about the most\n",
      "commodious and effectual ways and means of raising money, without\n",
      "grieving the subject.  The first affirmed, “the justest method would be,\n",
      "to lay a certain tax upon vices and folly; and the sum fixed upon every\n",
      "man to be rated, after the fairest manner, by a jury of his neighbours.”\n",
      "The second was of an opinion directly contrary; “to tax those qualities\n",
      "of body and mind, for which men chiefly value themselves; the rate to be\n",
      "more or less, according to the degrees of excelling; the decision whereof\n",
      "should be left entirely to their own breast.”  The highest tax was upon\n",
      "men who are the greatest favourites of the other sex, and the\n",
      "assessments, according to the number and nature of the favours they have\n",
      "received; for which, they are allowed to be their own vouchers.  Wit,\n",
      "valour, and politeness, were likewise proposed to be largely taxed, and\n",
      "collected in the same manner, by every person’s giving his own word for\n",
      "the quantum of what he possessed.  But as to honour, justice, wisdom, and\n",
      "learning, they should not be taxed at all; because they are\n",
      "qualifications of so singular a kind, that no man will either allow them\n",
      "in his neighbour or value them in himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The women were proposed to be taxed according to their beauty and skill\n",
      "in dressing, wherein they had the same privilege with the men, to be\n",
      "determined by their own judgment.  But constancy, chastity, good sense,\n",
      "and good nature, were not rated, because they would not bear the charge\n",
      "of collecting.\n",
      "\n",
      "To keep senators in the interest of the crown, it was proposed that the\n",
      "members should raffle for employment; every man first taking an oath, and\n",
      "giving security, that he would vote for the court, whether he won or not;\n",
      "after which, the losers had, in their turn, the liberty of raffling upon\n",
      "the next vacancy.  Thus, hope and expectation would be kept alive; none\n",
      "would complain of broken promises, but impute their disappointments\n",
      "wholly to fortune, whose shoulders are broader and stronger than those of\n",
      "a ministry.\n",

      "attending on his highness.  This was immediately granted, and we all\n",
      "three entered the gate of the palace between two rows of guards, armed\n",
      "and dressed after a very antic manner, and with something in their\n",
      "countenances that made my flesh creep with a horror I cannot express.  We\n",
      "passed through several apartments, between servants of the same sort,\n",
      "ranked on each side as before, till we came to the chamber of presence;\n",
      "where, after three profound obeisances, and a few general questions, we\n",
      "were permitted to sit on three stools, near the lowest step of his\n",
      "highness’s throne.  He understood the language of Balnibarbi, although it\n",
      "was different from that of this island.  He desired me to give him some\n",
      "account of my travels; and, to let me see that I should be treated\n",
      "without ceremony, he dismissed all his attendants with a turn of his\n",
      "finger; at which, to my great astonishment, they vanished in an instant,\n",
      "like visions in a dream when we awake on a sudden.  I could not recover\n",
      "myself in some time, till the governor assured me, “that I should receive\n",
      "no hurt:” and observing my two companions to be under no concern, who had\n",
      "been often entertained in the same manner, I began to take courage, and\n",
      "related to his highness a short history of my several adventures; yet not\n",
      "without some hesitation, and frequently looking behind me to the place\n",
      "where I had seen those domestic spectres.  I had the honour to dine with\n",
      "the governor, where a new set of ghosts served up the meat, and waited at\n",
      "table.  I now observed myself to be less terrified than I had been in the\n",
      "morning.  I stayed till sunset, but humbly desired his highness to excuse\n",
      "me for not accepting his invitation of lodging in the palace.  My two\n",
      "friends and I lay at a private house in the town adjoining, which is the\n",
      "capital of this little island; and the next morning we returned to pay\n",
      "our duty to the governor, as he was pleased to command us.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this manner we continued in the island for ten days, most part of\n",
      "every day with the governor, and at night in our lodging.  I soon grew so\n",
      "familiarized to the sight of spirits, that after the third or fourth time\n",
      "they gave me no emotion at all: or, if I had any apprehensions left, my\n",
      "curiosity prevailed over them.  For his highness the governor ordered me\n",
      "“to call up whatever persons I would choose to name, and in whatever\n",
      "numbers, among all the dead from the beginning of the world to the\n",
      "present time, and command them to answer any questions I should think fit\n",
      "to ask; with this condition, that my questions must be confined within\n",
      "the compass of the times they lived in.  And one thing I might depend\n",
      "upon, that they would certainly tell me the truth, for lying was a talent\n",

      "I made my humble acknowledgments to his highness for so great a favour.\n",
      "We were in a chamber, from whence there was a fair prospect into the\n",

      "of pomp and magnificence, I desired to see Alexander the Great at the\n",
      "head of his army, just after the battle of Arbela: which, upon a motion\n",
      "of the governor’s finger, immediately appeared in a large field, under\n",
      "the window where we stood.  Alexander was called up into the room: it was\n",
      "with great difficulty that I understood his Greek, and had but little of\n",
      "my own.  He assured me upon his honour “that he was not poisoned, but\n",
      "died of a bad fever by excessive drinking.”\n",

      "somewhat a later age in counterview, in another.  The first seemed to be\n",

      "A further account of Glubbdubdrib.  Ancient and modern history corrected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having a desire to see those ancients who were most renowned for wit and\n",
      "learning, I set apart one day on purpose.  I proposed that Homer and\n",
      "Aristotle might appear at the head of all their commentators; but these\n",
      "were so numerous, that some hundreds were forced to attend in the court,\n",
      "and outward rooms of the palace.  I knew, and could distinguish those two\n",
      "heroes, at first sight, not only from the crowd, but from each other.\n",
      "Homer was the taller and comelier person of the two, walked very erect\n",
      "for one of his age, and his eyes were the most quick and piercing I ever\n",
      "beheld.  Aristotle stooped much, and made use of a staff.  His visage was\n",
      "meagre, his hair lank and thin, and his voice hollow.  I soon discovered\n",
      "that both of them were perfect strangers to the rest of the company, and\n",
      "had never seen or heard of them before; and I had a whisper from a ghost\n",
      "who shall be nameless, “that these commentators always kept in the most\n",
      "distant quarters from their principals, in the lower world, through a\n",
      "consciousness of shame and guilt, because they had so horribly\n",
      "misrepresented the meaning of those authors to posterity.”  I introduced\n",
      "Didymus and Eustathius to Homer, and prevailed on him to treat them\n",
      "better than perhaps they deserved, for he soon found they wanted a genius\n",
      "to enter into the spirit of a poet.  But Aristotle was out of all\n",
      "patience with the account I gave him of Scotus and Ramus, as I presented\n",
      "them to him; and he asked them, “whether the rest of the tribe were as\n",
      "great dunces as themselves?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I then desired the governor to call up Descartes and Gassendi, with whom\n",
      "I prevailed to explain their systems to Aristotle.  This great\n",
      "philosopher freely acknowledged his own mistakes in natural philosophy,\n",
      "because he proceeded in many things upon conjecture, as all men must do;\n",
      "and he found that Gassendi, who had made the doctrine of Epicurus as\n",
      "palatable as he could, and the vortices of Descartes, were equally to be\n",
      "exploded.  He predicted the same fate to _attraction_, whereof the\n",
      "present learned are such zealous asserters.  He said, “that new systems\n",
      "of nature were but new fashions, which would vary in every age; and even\n",
      "those, who pretend to demonstrate them from mathematical principles,\n",
      "would flourish but a short period of time, and be out of vogue when that\n",

      "I spent five days in conversing with many others of the ancient learned.\n",
      "I saw most of the first Roman emperors.  I prevailed on the governor to\n",
      "call up Heliogabalus’s cooks to dress us a dinner, but they could not\n",
      "show us much of their skill, for want of materials.  A helot of Agesilaus\n",
      "made us a dish of Spartan broth, but I was not able to get down a second\n",
      "spoonful.\n",

      "hundred years past, in our own and other countries of Europe; and having\n",

      "governor would call up a dozen or two of kings, with their ancestors in\n",
      "order for eight or nine generations.  But my disappointment was grievous\n",
      "and unexpected.  For, instead of a long train with royal diadems, I saw\n",
      "in one family two fiddlers, three spruce courtiers, and an Italian\n",
      "prelate.  In another, a barber, an abbot, and two cardinals.  I have too\n",
      "great a veneration for crowned heads, to dwell any longer on so nice a\n",
      "subject.  But as to counts, marquises, dukes, earls, and the like, I was\n",
      "not so scrupulous.  And I confess, it was not without some pleasure, that\n",
      "I found myself able to trace the particular features, by which certain\n",
      "families are distinguished, up to their originals.  I could plainly\n",
      "discover whence one family derives a long chin; why a second has abounded\n",
      "with knaves for two generations, and fools for two more; why a third\n",
      "happened to be crack-brained, and a fourth to be sharpers; whence it\n",
      "came, what Polydore Virgil says of a certain great house, _Nec vir\n",
      "fortis_, _nec foemina casta_; how cruelty, falsehood, and cowardice, grew\n",
      "to be characteristics by which certain families are distinguished as much\n",
      "as by their coats of arms; who first brought the pox into a noble house,\n",
      "which has lineally descended scrofulous tumours to their posterity.\n",

      "been exalted to the highest places of trust, power, dignity, and profit:\n",
      "how great a share in the motions and events of courts, councils, and\n",
      "senates might be challenged by bawds, whores, pimps, parasites, and\n",
      "buffoons.  How low an opinion I had of human wisdom and integrity, when I\n",
      "was truly informed of the springs and motives of great enterprises and\n",

      "a cup of poison; will repeat the discourse between a prince and chief\n",

      "ambassadors and secretaries of state; and have the perpetual misfortune\n",

      "for Luggnagg.  The two gentlemen, and some others, were so generous and\n",
      "kind as to furnish me with provisions, and see me on board.  I was a\n",
      "month in this voyage.  We had one violent storm, and were under a\n",
      "necessity of steering westward to get into the trade wind, which holds\n",
      "for above sixty leagues.  On the 21st of April, 1708, we sailed into the\n",
      "river of Clumegnig, which is a seaport town, at the south-east point of\n",
      "Luggnagg.  We cast anchor within a league of the town, and made a signal\n",
      "for a pilot.  Two of them came on board in less than half an hour, by\n",
      "whom we were guided between certain shoals and rocks, which are very\n",

      "plausible and consistent as I could; but I thought it necessary to\n",
      "disguise my country, and call myself a Hollander; because my intentions\n",
      "were for Japan, and I knew the Dutch were the only Europeans permitted to\n",
      "enter into that kingdom.  I therefore told the officer, “that having been\n",
      "shipwrecked on the coast of Balnibarbi, and cast on a rock, I was\n",
      "received up into Laputa, or the flying island (of which he had often\n",
      "heard), and was now endeavouring to get to Japan, whence I might find a\n",
      "convenience of returning to my own country.”  The officer said, “I must\n",
      "be confined till he could receive orders from court, for which he would\n",
      "write immediately, and hoped to receive an answer in a fortnight.”  I was\n",
      "carried to a convenient lodging with a sentry placed at the door;\n",
      "however, I had the liberty of a large garden, and was treated with\n",
      "humanity enough, being maintained all the time at the king’s charge.  I\n",
      "was invited by several persons, chiefly out of curiosity, because it was\n",
      "reported that I came from countries very remote, of which they had never\n",

      "I hired a young man, who came in the same ship, to be an interpreter; he\n",
      "was a native of Luggnagg, but had lived some years at Maldonada, and was\n",
      "a perfect master of both languages.  By his assistance, I was able to\n",
      "hold a conversation with those who came to visit me; but this consisted\n",
      "only of their questions, and my answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The despatch came from court about the time we expected.  It contained a\n",
      "warrant for conducting me and my retinue to _Traldragdubh_, or\n",
      "_Trildrogdrib_ (for it is pronounced both ways as near as I can\n",
      "remember), by a party of ten horse.  All my retinue was that poor lad for\n",
      "an interpreter, whom I persuaded into my service, and, at my humble\n",
      "request, we had each of us a mule to ride on.  A messenger was despatched\n",

      "when it would by his gracious pleasure that I might have the honour to\n",
      "lick the dust before his footstool.”  This is the court style, and I\n",
      "found it to be more than matter of form: for, upon my admittance two days\n",
      "after my arrival, I was commanded to crawl upon my belly, and lick the\n",
      "floor as I advanced; but, on account of my being a stranger, care was\n",
      "taken to have it made so clean, that the dust was not offensive.\n",
      "However, this was a peculiar grace, not allowed to any but persons of the\n",
      "highest rank, when they desire an admittance.  Nay, sometimes the floor\n",
      "is strewed with dust on purpose, when the person to be admitted happens\n",
      "to have powerful enemies at court; and I have seen a great lord with his\n",
      "mouth so crammed, that when he had crept to the proper distance from the\n",
      "throne; he was not able to speak a word.  Neither is there any remedy;\n",
      "because it is capital for those, who receive an audience to spit or wipe\n",
      "their mouths in his majesty’s presence.  There is indeed another custom,\n",
      "which I cannot altogether approve of: when the king has a mind to put any\n",
      "of his nobles to death in a gentle indulgent manner, he commands the\n",
      "floor to be strewed with a certain brown powder of a deadly composition,\n",
      "which being licked up, infallibly kills him in twenty-four hours.  But in\n",
      "justice to this prince’s great clemency, and the care he has of his\n",
      "subjects’ lives (wherein it were much to be wished that the Monarchs of\n",
      "Europe would imitate him), it must be mentioned for his honour, that\n",
      "strict orders are given to have the infected parts of the floor well\n",
      "washed after every such execution, which, if his domestics neglect, they\n",
      "are in danger of incurring his royal displeasure.  I myself heard him\n",
      "give directions, that one of his pages should be whipped, whose turn it\n",
      "was to give notice about washing the floor after an execution, but\n",
      "maliciously had omitted it; by which neglect a young lord of great hopes,\n",
      "coming to an audience, was unfortunately poisoned, although the king at\n",
      "that time had no design against his life.  But this good prince was so\n",
      "gracious as to forgive the poor page his whipping, upon promise that he\n",

      "circular spot in the forehead, directly over the left eyebrow, which was\n",
      "an infallible mark that it should never die.”  The spot, as he described\n",
      "it, “was about the compass of a silver threepence, but in the course of\n",
      "time grew larger, and changed its colour; for at twelve years old it\n",
      "became green, so continued till five and twenty, then turned to a deep\n",
      "blue: at five and forty it grew coal black, and as large as an English\n",
      "shilling; but never admitted any further alteration.”  He said, “these\n",
      "births were so rare, that he did not believe there could be above eleven\n",

      "born; about three years ago: that these productions were not peculiar to\n",
      "any family, but a mere effect of chance; and the children of the\n",

      "and infirmities of other old men, but many more which arose from the\n",
      "dreadful prospect of never dying.  They were not only opinionative,\n",
      "peevish, covetous, morose, vain, talkative, but incapable of friendship,\n",
      "and dead to all natural affection, which never descended below their\n",
      "grandchildren.  Envy and impotent desires are their prevailing passions.\n",
      "But those objects against which their envy seems principally directed,\n",
      "are the vices of the younger sort and the deaths of the old.  By\n",

      "possibility of pleasure; and whenever they see a funeral, they lament and\n",
      "repine that others have gone to a harbour of rest to which they\n",

      "particulars of any fact, it is safer to depend on common tradition, than\n",
      "upon their best recollections.  The least miserable among them appear to\n",

      "country, was pleased to give me his license to depart; and honoured me\n",
      "with a letter of recommendation, under his own hand, to the Emperor of\n",
      "Japan.  He likewise presented me with four hundred and forty-four large\n",

      "Xamoschi, situated on the south-east part of Japan; the town lies on the\n",
      "western point, where there is a narrow strait leading northward into\n",
      "along arm of the sea, upon the north-west part of which, Yedo, the\n",
      "metropolis, stands.  At landing, I showed the custom-house officers my\n",
      "letter from the king of Luggnagg to his imperial majesty.  They knew the\n",
      "seal perfectly well; it was as broad as the palm of my hand.  The\n",
      "impression was, _A king lifting up a lame beggar from the earth_.  The\n",
      "magistrates of the town, hearing of my letter, received me as a public\n",
      "minister.  They provided me with carriages and servants, and bore my\n",
      "charges to Yedo; where I was admitted to an audience, and delivered my\n",
      "letter, which was opened with great ceremony, and explained to the\n",
      "Emperor by an interpreter, who then gave me notice, by his majesty’s\n",
      "order, “that I should signify my request, and, whatever it were, it\n",
      "should be granted, for the sake of his royal brother of Luggnagg.”  This\n",
      "interpreter was a person employed to transact affairs with the\n",
      "Hollanders.  He soon conjectured, by my countenance, that I was a\n",
      "European, and therefore repeated his majesty’s commands in Low Dutch,\n",
      "which he spoke perfectly well.  I answered, as I had before determined,\n",
      "“that I was a Dutch merchant, shipwrecked in a very remote country,\n",
      "whence I had travelled by sea and land to Luggnagg, and then took\n",
      "shipping for Japan; where I knew my countrymen often traded, and with\n",
      "some of these I hoped to get an opportunity of returning into Europe: I\n",
      "therefore most humbly entreated his royal favour, to give order that I\n",
      "should be conducted in safety to Nangasac.”  To this I added another\n",
      "petition, “that for the sake of my patron the king of Luggnagg, his\n",
      "majesty would condescend to excuse my performing the ceremony imposed on\n",
      "my countrymen, of trampling upon the crucifix: because I had been thrown\n",
      "into his kingdom by my misfortunes, without any intention of trading.”\n",
      "When this latter petition was interpreted to the Emperor, he seemed a\n",
      "little surprised; and said, “he believed I was the first of my countrymen\n",
      "who ever made any scruple in this point; and that he began to doubt,\n",
      "whether I was a real Hollander, or not; but rather suspected I must be a\n",
      "Christian.  However, for the reasons I had offered, but chiefly to\n",
      "gratify the king of Luggnagg by an uncommon mark of his favour, he would\n",
      "comply with the singularity of my humour; but the affair must be managed\n",
      "with dexterity, and his officers should be commanded to let me pass, as\n",
      "it were by forgetfulness.  For he assured me, that if the secret should\n",
      "be discovered by my countrymen the Dutch, they would cut my throat in the\n",
      "voyage.”  I returned my thanks, by the interpreter, for so unusual a\n",
      "favour; and some troops being at that time on their march to Nangasac,\n",
      "the commanding officer had orders to convey me safe thither, with\n",
      "particular instructions about the business of the crucifix.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the 9th day of June, 1709, I arrived at Nangasac, after a very long\n",
      "and troublesome journey.  I soon fell into the company of some Dutch\n",
      "sailors belonging to the Amboyna, of Amsterdam, a stout ship of 450 tons.\n",
      "I had lived long in Holland, pursuing my studies at Leyden, and I spoke\n",
      "Dutch well.  The seamen soon knew whence I came last: they were curious\n",
      "to inquire into my voyages and course of life.  I made up a story as\n",
      "short and probable as I could, but concealed the greatest part.  I knew\n",
      "many persons in Holland.  I was able to invent names for my parents, whom\n",
      "I pretended to be obscure people in the province of Gelderland.  I would\n",
      "have given the captain (one Theodorus Vangrult) what he pleased to ask\n",
      "for my voyage to Holland; but understanding I was a surgeon, he was\n",
      "contented to take half the usual rate, on condition that I would serve\n",
      "him in the way of my calling.  Before we took shipping, I was often asked\n",
      "by some of the crew, whether I had performed the ceremony above\n",
      "mentioned?  I evaded the question by general answers; “that I had\n",
      "satisfied the Emperor and court in all particulars.”  However, a\n",
      "malicious rogue of a skipper went to an officer, and pointing to me, told\n",
      "him, “I had not yet trampled on the crucifix;” but the other, who had\n",
      "received instructions to let me pass, gave the rascal twenty strokes on\n",

      "with him, but in vain; neither would he so much as tell me who their new\n",

      "In this desolate condition I advanced forward, and soon got upon firm\n",

      "grass, and several fields of oats.  I walked very circumspectly, for fear\n",

      "distinctly marking their form.  Their heads and breasts were covered with\n",
      "a thick hair, some frizzled, and others lank; they had beards like goats,\n",
      "and a long ridge of hair down their backs, and the fore parts of their\n",
      "legs and feet; but the rest of their bodies was bare, so that I might see\n",
      "their skins, which were of a brown buff colour.  They had no tails, nor\n",
      "any hair at all on their buttocks, except about the anus, which, I\n",
      "presume, nature had placed there to defend them as they sat on the\n",
      "ground, for this posture they used, as well as lying down, and often\n",
      "stood on their hind feet.  They climbed high trees as nimbly as a\n",
      "squirrel, for they had strong extended claws before and behind,\n",
      "terminating in sharp points, and hooked.  They would often spring, and\n",
      "bound, and leap, with prodigious agility.  The females were not so large\n",
      "as the males; they had long lank hair on their heads, but none on their\n",
      "faces, nor any thing more than a sort of down on the rest of their\n",
      "bodies, except about the anus and pudenda.  The dugs hung between their\n",
      "fore feet, and often reached almost to the ground as they walked.  The\n",
      "hair of both sexes was of several colours, brown, red, black, and yellow.\n",
      "Upon the whole, I never beheld, in all my travels, so disagreeable an\n",
      "animal, or one against which I naturally conceived so strong an\n",
      "antipathy.  So that, thinking I had seen enough, full of contempt and\n",
      "aversion, I got up, and pursued the beaten road, hoping it might direct\n",
      "me to the cabin of some Indian.  I had not got far, when I met one of\n",
      "these creatures full in my way, and coming up directly to me.  The ugly\n",
      "monster, when he saw me, distorted several ways, every feature of his\n",
      "visage, and stared, as at an object he had never seen before; then\n",
      "approaching nearer, lifted up his fore-paw, whether out of curiosity or\n",
      "mischief I could not tell; but I drew my hanger, and gave him a good blow\n",
      "with the flat side of it, for I durst not strike with the edge, fearing\n",
      "the inhabitants might be provoked against me, if they should come to know\n",
      "that I had killed or maimed any of their cattle.  When the beast felt the\n",
      "smart, he drew back, and roared so loud, that a herd of at least forty\n",
      "came flocking about me from the next field, howling and making odious\n",
      "faces; but I ran to the body of a tree, and leaning my back against it,\n",
      "kept them off by waving my hanger.  Several of this cursed brood, getting\n",
      "hold of the branches behind, leaped up into the tree, whence they began\n",
      "to discharge their excrements on my head; however, I escaped pretty well\n",
      "by sticking close to the stem of the tree, but was almost stifled with\n",
      "the filth, which fell about me on every side.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the midst of this distress, I observed them all to run away on a\n",
      "sudden as fast as they could; at which I ventured to leave the tree and\n",
      "pursue the road, wondering what it was that could put them into this\n",
      "fright.  But looking on my left hand, I saw a horse walking softly in the\n",
      "field; which my persecutors having sooner discovered, was the cause of\n",
      "their flight.  The horse started a little, when he came near me, but soon\n",
      "recovering himself, looked full in my face with manifest tokens of\n",
      "wonder; he viewed my hands and feet, walking round me several times.  I\n",
      "would have pursued my journey, but he placed himself directly in the way,\n",
      "yet looking with a very mild aspect, never offering the least violence.\n",
      "We stood gazing at each other for some time; at last I took the boldness\n",
      "to reach my hand towards his neck with a design to stroke it, using the\n",
      "common style and whistle of jockeys, when they are going to handle a\n",
      "strange horse.  But this animal seemed to receive my civilities with\n",
      "disdain, shook his head, and bent his brows, softly raising up his right\n",
      "fore-foot to remove my hand.  Then he neighed three or four times, but in\n",
      "so different a cadence, that I almost began to think he was speaking to\n",
      "himself, in some language of his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he and I were thus employed, another horse came up; who applying\n",
      "himself to the first in a very formal manner, they gently struck each\n",
      "other’s right hoof before, neighing several times by turns, and varying\n",
      "the sound, which seemed to be almost articulate.  They went some paces\n",
      "off, as if it were to confer together, walking side by side, backward and\n",
      "forward, like persons deliberating upon some affair of weight, but often\n",
      "turning their eyes towards me, as it were to watch that I might not\n",
      "escape.  I was amazed to see such actions and behaviour in brute beasts;\n",
      "and concluded with myself, that if the inhabitants of this country were\n",
      "endued with a proportionable degree of reason, they must needs be the\n",
      "wisest people upon earth.  This thought gave me so much comfort, that I\n",
      "resolved to go forward, until I could discover some house or village, or\n",
      "meet with any of the natives, leaving the two horses to discourse\n",
      "together as they pleased.  But the first, who was a dapple gray,\n",
      "observing me to steal off, neighed after me in so expressive a tone, that\n",
      "I fancied myself to understand what he meant; whereupon I turned back,\n",
      "and came near to him to expect his farther commands: but concealing my\n",
      "fear as much as I could, for I began to be in some pain how this\n",
      "adventure might terminate; and the reader will easily believe I did not\n",
      "much like my present situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two horses came up close to me, looking with great earnestness upon\n",
      "my face and hands.  The gray steed rubbed my hat all round with his right\n",
      "fore-hoof, and discomposed it so much that I was forced to adjust it\n",
      "better by taking it off and settling it again; whereat, both he and his\n",
      "companion (who was a brown bay) appeared to be much surprised: the latter\n",
      "felt the lappet of my coat, and finding it to hang loose about me, they\n",
      "both looked with new signs of wonder.  He stroked my right hand, seeming\n",
      "to admire the softness and colour; but he squeezed it so hard between his\n",
      "hoof and his pastern, that I was forced to roar; after which they both\n",
      "touched me with all possible tenderness.  They were under great\n",
      "perplexity about my shoes and stockings, which they felt very often,\n",
      "neighing to each other, and using various gestures, not unlike those of a\n",
      "philosopher, when he would attempt to solve some new and difficult\n",
      "phenomenon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon the whole, the behaviour of these animals was so orderly and\n",
      "rational, so acute and judicious, that I at last concluded they must\n",
      "needs be magicians, who had thus metamorphosed themselves upon some\n",
      "design, and seeing a stranger in the way, resolved to divert themselves\n",
      "with him; or, perhaps, were really amazed at the sight of a man so very\n",
      "different in habit, feature, and complexion, from those who might\n",
      "probably live in so remote a climate.  Upon the strength of this\n",
      "reasoning, I ventured to address them in the following manner:\n",
      "“Gentlemen, if you be conjurers, as I have good cause to believe, you can\n",
      "understand my language; therefore I make bold to let your worships know\n",
      "that I am a poor distressed Englishman, driven by his misfortunes upon\n",
      "your coast; and I entreat one of you to let me ride upon his back, as if\n",
      "he were a real horse, to some house or village where I can be relieved.\n",
      "In return of which favour, I will make you a present of this knife and\n",
      "bracelet,” taking them out of my pocket.  The two creatures stood silent\n",
      "while I spoke, seeming to listen with great attention, and when I had\n",
      "ended, they neighed frequently towards each other, as if they were\n",
      "engaged in serious conversation.  I plainly observed that their language\n",
      "expressed the passions very well, and the words might, with little pains,\n",
      "be resolved into an alphabet more easily than the Chinese.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could frequently distinguish the word _Yahoo_, which was repeated by\n",
      "each of them several times: and although it was impossible for me to\n",
      "conjecture what it meant, yet while the two horses were busy in\n",
      "conversation, I endeavoured to practise this word upon my tongue; and as\n",
      "soon as they were silent, I boldly pronounced _Yahoo_ in a loud voice,\n",
      "imitating at the same time, as near as I could, the neighing of a horse;\n",
      "at which they were both visibly surprised; and the gray repeated the same\n",
      "word twice, as if he meant to teach me the right accent; wherein I spoke\n",
      "after him as well as I could, and found myself perceivably to improve\n",
      "every time, though very far from any degree of perfection.  Then the bay\n",
      "tried me with a second word, much harder to be pronounced; but reducing\n",
      "it to the English orthography, may be spelt thus, _Houyhnhnm_.  I did not\n",
      "succeed in this so well as in the former; but after two or three farther\n",
      "trials, I had better fortune; and they both appeared amazed at my\n",
      "capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "After some further discourse, which I then conjectured might relate to\n",
      "me, the two friends took their leaves, with the same compliment of\n",
      "striking each other’s hoof; and the gray made me signs that I should walk\n",
      "before him; wherein I thought it prudent to comply, till I could find a\n",
      "better director.  When I offered to slacken my pace, he would cry _hhuun\n",
      "hhuun_: I guessed his meaning, and gave him to understand, as well as I\n",
      "could, “that I was weary, and not able to walk faster;” upon which he\n",
      "would stand awhile to let me rest.\n",

      "The author conducted by a Houyhnhnm to his house.  The house described.\n",
      "The author’s reception.  The food of the Houyhnhnms.  The author in\n",
      "distress for want of meat.  Is at last relieved.  His manner of feeding\n",
      "in this country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having travelled about three miles, we came to a long kind of building,\n",
      "made of timber stuck in the ground, and wattled across; the roof was low\n",
      "and covered with straw.  I now began to be a little comforted; and took\n",
      "out some toys, which travellers usually carry for presents to the savage\n",
      "Indians of America, and other parts, in hopes the people of the house\n",
      "would be thereby encouraged to receive me kindly.  The horse made me a\n",
      "sign to go in first; it was a large room with a smooth clay floor, and a\n",
      "rack and manger, extending the whole length on one side.  There were\n",
      "three nags and two mares, not eating, but some of them sitting down upon\n",
      "their hams, which I very much wondered at; but wondered more to see the\n",
      "rest employed in domestic business; these seemed but ordinary cattle.\n",
      "However, this confirmed my first opinion, that a people who could so far\n",
      "civilise brute animals, must needs excel in wisdom all the nations of the\n",
      "world.  The gray came in just after, and thereby prevented any ill\n",
      "treatment which the others might have given me.  He neighed to them\n",
      "several times in a style of authority, and received answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond this room there were three others, reaching the length of the\n",
      "house, to which you passed through three doors, opposite to each other,\n",
      "in the manner of a vista.  We went through the second room towards the\n",
      "third.  Here the gray walked in first, beckoning me to attend: I waited\n",
      "in the second room, and got ready my presents for the master and mistress\n",
      "of the house; they were two knives, three bracelets of false pearls, a\n",
      "small looking-glass, and a bead necklace.  The horse neighed three or\n",
      "four times, and I waited to hear some answers in a human voice, but I\n",
      "heard no other returns than in the same dialect, only one or two a little\n",
      "shriller than his.  I began to think that this house must belong to some\n",
      "person of great note among them, because there appeared so much ceremony\n",
      "before I could gain admittance.  But, that a man of quality should be\n",
      "served all by horses, was beyond my comprehension.  I feared my brain was\n",
      "disturbed by my sufferings and misfortunes.  I roused myself, and looked\n",
      "about me in the room where I was left alone: this was furnished like the\n",
      "first, only after a more elegant manner.  I rubbed my eyes often, but the\n",
      "same objects still occurred.  I pinched my arms and sides to awake\n",
      "myself, hoping I might be in a dream.  I then absolutely concluded, that\n",
      "all these appearances could be nothing else but necromancy and magic.\n",
      "But I had no time to pursue these reflections; for the gray horse came to\n",
      "the door, and made me a sign to follow him into the third room where I\n",
      "saw a very comely mare, together with a colt and foal, sitting on their\n",
      "haunches upon mats of straw, not unartfully made, and perfectly neat and\n",
      "clean.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mare soon after my entrance rose from her mat, and coming up close,\n",
      "after having nicely observed my hands and face, gave me a most\n",
      "contemptuous look; and turning to the horse, I heard the word _Yahoo_\n",
      "often repeated betwixt them; the meaning of which word I could not then\n",
      "comprehend, although it was the first I had learned to pronounce.  But I\n",
      "was soon better informed, to my everlasting mortification; for the horse,\n",
      "beckoning to me with his head, and repeating the _hhuun_, _hhuun_, as he\n",
      "did upon the road, which I understood was to attend him, led me out into\n",
      "a kind of court, where was another building, at some distance from the\n",
      "house.  Here we entered, and I saw three of those detestable creatures,\n",
      "which I first met after my landing, feeding upon roots, and the flesh of\n",
      "some animals, which I afterwards found to be that of asses and dogs, and\n",
      "now and then a cow, dead by accident or disease.  They were all tied by\n",
      "the neck with strong withes fastened to a beam; they held their food\n",
      "between the claws of their fore feet, and tore it with their teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The master horse ordered a sorrel nag, one of his servants, to untie the\n",
      "largest of these animals, and take him into the yard.  The beast and I\n",
      "were brought close together, and by our countenances diligently compared\n",
      "both by master and servant, who thereupon repeated several times the word\n",
      "_Yahoo_.  My horror and astonishment are not to be described, when I\n",
      "observed in this abominable animal, a perfect human figure: the face of\n",
      "it indeed was flat and broad, the nose depressed, the lips large, and the\n",
      "mouth wide; but these differences are common to all savage nations, where\n",
      "the lineaments of the countenance are distorted, by the natives suffering\n",
      "their infants to lie grovelling on the earth, or by carrying them on\n",
      "their backs, nuzzling with their face against the mothers’ shoulders.\n",
      "The fore-feet of the _Yahoo_ differed from my hands in nothing else but\n",
      "the length of the nails, the coarseness and brownness of the palms, and\n",
      "the hairiness on the backs.  There was the same resemblance between our\n",
      "feet, with the same differences; which I knew very well, though the\n",
      "horses did not, because of my shoes and stockings; the same in every part\n",
      "of our bodies except as to hairiness and colour, which I have already\n",
      "described.\n",
      "\n",
      "The great difficulty that seemed to stick with the two horses, was to see\n",
      "the rest of my body so very different from that of a _Yahoo_, for which I\n",
      "was obliged to my clothes, whereof they had no conception.  The sorrel\n",
      "nag offered me a root, which he held (after their manner, as we shall\n",
      "describe in its proper place) between his hoof and pastern; I took it in\n",
      "my hand, and, having smelt it, returned it to him again as civilly as I\n",
      "could.  He brought out of the _Yahoos_’ kennel a piece of ass’s flesh;\n",
      "but it smelt so offensively that I turned from it with loathing: he then\n",
      "threw it to the _Yahoo_, by whom it was greedily devoured.  He afterwards\n",
      "showed me a wisp of hay, and a fetlock full of oats; but I shook my head,\n",
      "to signify that neither of these were food for me.  And indeed I now\n",
      "apprehended that I must absolutely starve, if I did not get to some of my\n",
      "own species; for as to those filthy _Yahoos_, although there were few\n",
      "greater lovers of mankind at that time than myself, yet I confess I never\n",
      "saw any sensitive being so detestable on all accounts; and the more I\n",
      "came near them the more hateful they grew, while I stayed in that\n",
      "country.  This the master horse observed by my behaviour, and therefore\n",
      "sent the _Yahoo_ back to his kennel.  He then put his fore-hoof to his\n",
      "mouth, at which I was much surprised, although he did it with ease, and\n",
      "with a motion that appeared perfectly natural, and made other signs, to\n",
      "know what I would eat; but I could not return him such an answer as he\n",
      "was able to apprehend; and if he had understood me, I did not see how it\n",
      "was possible to contrive any way for finding myself nourishment.  While\n",
      "we were thus engaged, I observed a cow passing by, whereupon I pointed to\n",
      "her, and expressed a desire to go and milk her.  This had its effect; for\n",
      "he led me back into the house, and ordered a mare-servant to open a room,\n",
      "where a good store of milk lay in earthen and wooden vessels, after a\n",
      "very orderly and cleanly manner.  She gave me a large bowlful, of which I\n",
      "drank very heartily, and found myself well refreshed.\n",
      "\n",
      "About noon, I saw coming towards the house a kind of vehicle drawn like a\n",
      "sledge by four _Yahoos_.  There was in it an old steed, who seemed to be\n",
      "of quality; he alighted with his hind-feet forward, having by accident\n",
      "got a hurt in his left fore-foot.  He came to dine with our horse, who\n",
      "received him with great civility.  They dined in the best room, and had\n",
      "oats boiled in milk for the second course, which the old horse ate warm,\n",
      "but the rest cold.  Their mangers were placed circular in the middle of\n",
      "the room, and divided into several partitions, round which they sat on\n",
      "their haunches, upon bosses of straw.  In the middle was a large rack,\n",
      "with angles answering to every partition of the manger; so that each\n",
      "horse and mare ate their own hay, and their own mash of oats and milk,\n",
      "with much decency and regularity.  The behaviour of the young colt and\n",
      "foal appeared very modest, and that of the master and mistress extremely\n",
      "cheerful and complaisant to their guest.  The gray ordered me to stand by\n",
      "him; and much discourse passed between him and his friend concerning me,\n",
      "as I found by the stranger’s often looking on me, and the frequent\n",
      "repetition of the word _Yahoo_.\n",
      "\n",
      "I happened to wear my gloves, which the master gray observing, seemed\n",
      "perplexed, discovering signs of wonder what I had done to my fore-feet.\n",
      "He put his hoof three or four times to them, as if he would signify, that\n",
      "I should reduce them to their former shape, which I presently did,\n",
      "pulling off both my gloves, and putting them into my pocket.  This\n",
      "occasioned farther talk; and I saw the company was pleased with my\n",
      "behaviour, whereof I soon found the good effects.  I was ordered to speak\n",
      "the few words I understood; and while they were at dinner, the master\n",
      "taught me the names for oats, milk, fire, water, and some others, which I\n",
      "could readily pronounce after him, having from my youth a great facility\n",
      "in learning languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "When dinner was done, the master horse took me aside, and by signs and\n",
      "words made me understand the concern he was in that I had nothing to eat.\n",
      "Oats in their tongue are called _hlunnh_.  This word I pronounced two or\n",
      "three times; for although I had refused them at first, yet, upon second\n",
      "thoughts, I considered that I could contrive to make of them a kind of\n",
      "bread, which might be sufficient, with milk, to keep me alive, till I\n",
      "could make my escape to some other country, and to creatures of my own\n",
      "species.  The horse immediately ordered a white mare servant of his\n",
      "family to bring me a good quantity of oats in a sort of wooden tray.\n",
      "These I heated before the fire, as well as I could, and rubbed them till\n",
      "the husks came off, which I made a shift to winnow from the grain.  I\n",
      "ground and beat them between two stones; then took water, and made them\n",
      "into a paste or cake, which I toasted at the fire and eat warm with milk.\n",
      "It was at first a very insipid diet, though common enough in many parts\n",
      "of Europe, but grew tolerable by time; and having been often reduced to\n",
      "hard fare in my life, this was not the first experiment I had made how\n",
      "easily nature is satisfied.  And I cannot but observe, that I never had\n",
      "one hours sickness while I stayed in this island.  It is true, I\n",
      "sometimes made a shift to catch a rabbit, or bird, by springs made of\n",
      "_Yahoo’s_ hairs; and I often gathered wholesome herbs, which I boiled,\n",
      "and ate as salads with my bread; and now and then, for a rarity, I made a\n",
      "little butter, and drank the whey.  I was at first at a great loss for\n",
      "salt, but custom soon reconciled me to the want of it; and I am confident\n",
      "that the frequent use of salt among us is an effect of luxury, and was\n",
      "first introduced only as a provocative to drink, except where it is\n",
      "necessary for preserving flesh in long voyages, or in places remote from\n",
      "great markets; for we observe no animal to be fond of it but man, and as\n",
      "to myself, when I left this country, it was a great while before I could\n",
      "endure the taste of it in anything that I ate.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is enough to say upon the subject of my diet, wherewith other\n",
      "travellers fill their books, as if the readers were personally concerned\n",
      "whether we fare well or ill.  However, it was necessary to mention this\n",
      "matter, lest the world should think it impossible that I could find\n",
      "sustenance for three years in such a country, and among such inhabitants.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it grew towards evening, the master horse ordered a place for me to\n",
      "lodge in; it was but six yards from the house and separated from the\n",

      "The author studies to learn the language.  The Houyhnhnm, his master,\n",
      "assists in teaching him.  The language described.  Several Houyhnhnms of\n",
      "quality come out of curiosity to see the author.  He gives his master a\n",
      "short account of his voyage.\n",
      "\n",
      "My principal endeavour was to learn the language, which my master (for so\n",
      "I shall henceforth call him), and his children, and every servant of his\n",
      "house, were desirous to teach me; for they looked upon it as a prodigy,\n",
      "that a brute animal should discover such marks of a rational creature.  I\n",
      "pointed to every thing, and inquired the name of it, which I wrote down\n",
      "in my journal-book when I was alone, and corrected my bad accent by\n",
      "desiring those of the family to pronounce it often.  In this employment,\n",
      "a sorrel nag, one of the under-servants, was very ready to assist me.\n",
      "\n",
      "In speaking, they pronounced through the nose and throat, and their\n",
      "language approaches nearest to the High-Dutch, or German, of any I know\n",
      "in Europe; but is much more graceful and significant.  The emperor\n",
      "Charles V. made almost the same observation, when he said “that if he\n",
      "were to speak to his horse, it should be in High-Dutch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The curiosity and impatience of my master were so great, that he spent\n",
      "many hours of his leisure to instruct me.  He was convinced (as he\n",
      "afterwards told me) that I must be a _Yahoo_; but my teachableness,\n",
      "civility, and cleanliness, astonished him; which were qualities\n",
      "altogether opposite to those animals.  He was most perplexed about my\n",
      "clothes, reasoning sometimes with himself, whether they were a part of my\n",
      "body: for I never pulled them off till the family were asleep, and got\n",
      "them on before they waked in the morning.  My master was eager to learn\n",
      "“whence I came; how I acquired those appearances of reason, which I\n",
      "discovered in all my actions; and to know my story from my own mouth,\n",
      "which he hoped he should soon do by the great proficiency I made in\n",
      "learning and pronouncing their words and sentences.”  To help my memory,\n",
      "I formed all I learned into the English alphabet, and writ the words\n",
      "down, with the translations.  This last, after some time, I ventured to\n",
      "do in my master’s presence.  It cost me much trouble to explain to him\n",
      "what I was doing; for the inhabitants have not the least idea of books or\n",
      "literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "In about ten weeks time, I was able to understand most of his questions;\n",
      "and in three months, could give him some tolerable answers.  He was\n",
      "extremely curious to know “from what part of the country I came, and how\n",
      "I was taught to imitate a rational creature; because the _Yahoos_ (whom\n",
      "he saw I exactly resembled in my head, hands, and face, that were only\n",
      "visible), with some appearance of cunning, and the strongest disposition\n",
      "to mischief, were observed to be the most unteachable of all brutes.”  I\n",
      "answered, “that I came over the sea, from a far place, with many others\n",
      "of my own kind, in a great hollow vessel made of the bodies of trees:\n",
      "that my companions forced me to land on this coast, and then left me to\n",
      "shift for myself.”  It was with some difficulty, and by the help of many\n",
      "signs, that I brought him to understand me.  He replied, “that I must\n",
      "needs be mistaken, or that I said the thing which was not;” for they have\n",
      "no word in their language to express lying or falsehood.  “He knew it was\n",
      "impossible that there could be a country beyond the sea, or that a parcel\n",
      "of brutes could move a wooden vessel whither they pleased upon water.  He\n",
      "was sure no _Houyhnhnm_ alive could make such a vessel, nor would trust\n",
      "_Yahoos_ to manage it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The word _Houyhnhnm_, in their tongue, signifies a _horse_, and, in its\n",
      "etymology, the _perfection of nature_.  I told my master, “that I was at\n",
      "a loss for expression, but would improve as fast as I could; and hoped,\n",
      "in a short time, I should be able to tell him wonders.”  He was pleased\n",
      "to direct his own mare, his colt, and foal, and the servants of the\n",
      "family, to take all opportunities of instructing me; and every day, for\n",
      "two or three hours, he was at the same pains himself.  Several horses and\n",
      "mares of quality in the neighbourhood came often to our house, upon the\n",
      "report spread of “a wonderful _Yahoo_, that could speak like a\n",
      "_Houyhnhnm_, and seemed, in his words and actions, to discover some\n",
      "glimmerings of reason.”  These delighted to converse with me: they put\n",
      "many questions, and received such answers as I was able to return.  By\n",
      "all these advantages I made so great a progress, that, in five months\n",
      "from my arrival I understood whatever was spoken, and could express\n",
      "myself tolerably well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The _Houyhnhnms_, who came to visit my master out of a design of seeing\n",
      "and talking with me, could hardly believe me to be a right _Yahoo_,\n",
      "because my body had a different covering from others of my kind.  They\n",
      "were astonished to observe me without the usual hair or skin, except on\n",
      "my head, face, and hands; but I discovered that secret to my master upon\n",
      "an accident which happened about a fortnight before.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have already told the reader, that every night, when the family were\n",
      "gone to bed, it was my custom to strip, and cover myself with my clothes.\n",
      "It happened, one morning early, that my master sent for me by the sorrel\n",
      "nag, who was his valet.  When he came I was fast asleep, my clothes\n",
      "fallen off on one side, and my shirt above my waist.  I awaked at the\n",
      "noise he made, and observed him to deliver his message in some disorder;\n",
      "after which he went to my master, and in a great fright gave him a very\n",
      "confused account of what he had seen.  This I presently discovered, for,\n",
      "going as soon as I was dressed to pay my attendance upon his honour, he\n",
      "asked me “the meaning of what his servant had reported, that I was not\n",
      "the same thing when I slept, as I appeared to be at other times; that his\n",
      "vale assured him, some part of me was white, some yellow, at least not so\n",
      "white, and some brown.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I had hitherto concealed the secret of my dress, in order to distinguish\n",
      "myself, as much as possible, from that cursed race of _Yahoos_; but now I\n",
      "found it in vain to do so any longer.  Besides, I considered that my\n",
      "clothes and shoes would soon wear out, which already were in a declining\n",
      "condition, and must be supplied by some contrivance from the hides of\n",
      "_Yahoos_, or other brutes; whereby the whole secret would be known.  I\n",
      "therefore told my master, “that in the country whence I came, those of my\n",
      "kind always covered their bodies with the hairs of certain animals\n",
      "prepared by art, as well for decency as to avoid the inclemencies of air,\n",
      "both hot and cold; of which, as to my own person, I would give him\n",
      "immediate conviction, if he pleased to command me: only desiring his\n",
      "excuse, if I did not expose those parts that nature taught us to\n",
      "conceal.”  He said, “my discourse was all very strange, but especially\n",
      "the last part; for he could not understand, why nature should teach us to\n",
      "conceal what nature had given; that neither himself nor family were\n",
      "ashamed of any parts of their bodies; but, however, I might do as I\n",
      "pleased.”  Whereupon I first unbuttoned my coat, and pulled it off.  I\n",
      "did the same with my waistcoat.  I drew off my shoes, stockings, and\n",
      "breeches.  I let my shirt down to my waist, and drew up the bottom;\n",
      "fastening it like a girdle about my middle, to hide my nakedness.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master observed the whole performance with great signs of curiosity\n",
      "and admiration.  He took up all my clothes in his pastern, one piece\n",
      "after another, and examined them diligently; he then stroked my body very\n",
      "gently, and looked round me several times; after which, he said, it was\n",
      "plain I must be a perfect _Yahoo_; but that I differed very much from the\n",
      "rest of my species in the softness, whiteness, and smoothness of my skin;\n",
      "my want of hair in several parts of my body; the shape and shortness of\n",
      "my claws behind and before; and my affectation of walking continually on\n",
      "my two hinder feet.  He desired to see no more; and gave me leave to put\n",
      "on my clothes again, for I was shuddering with cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "I expressed my uneasiness at his giving me so often the appellation of\n",
      "_Yahoo_, an odious animal, for which I had so utter a hatred and\n",
      "contempt: I begged he would forbear applying that word to me, and make\n",
      "the same order in his family and among his friends whom he suffered to\n",
      "see me.  I requested likewise, “that the secret of my having a false\n",
      "covering to my body, might be known to none but himself, at least as long\n",
      "as my present clothing should last; for as to what the sorrel nag, his\n",
      "valet, had observed, his honour might command him to conceal it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "All this my master very graciously consented to; and thus the secret was\n",
      "kept till my clothes began to wear out, which I was forced to supply by\n",
      "several contrivances that shall hereafter be mentioned.  In the meantime,\n",
      "he desired “I would go on with my utmost diligence to learn their\n",
      "language, because he was more astonished at my capacity for speech and\n",
      "reason, than at the figure of my body, whether it were covered or not;”\n",
      "adding, “that he waited with some impatience to hear the wonders which I\n",
      "promised to tell him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thenceforward he doubled the pains he had been at to instruct me: he\n",
      "brought me into all company, and made them treat me with civility;\n",
      "“because,” as he told them, privately, “this would put me into good\n",
      "humour, and make me more diverting.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Every day, when I waited on him, beside the trouble he was at in\n",
      "teaching, he would ask me several questions concerning myself, which I\n",
      "answered as well as I could, and by these means he had already received\n",
      "some general ideas, though very imperfect.  It would be tedious to relate\n",
      "the several steps by which I advanced to a more regular conversation; but\n",
      "the first account I gave of myself in any order and length was to this\n",
      "purpose:\n",
      "\n",
      "“That I came from a very far country, as I already had attempted to tell\n",
      "him, with about fifty more of my own species; that we travelled upon the\n",
      "seas in a great hollow vessel made of wood, and larger than his honour’s\n",
      "house.  I described the ship to him in the best terms I could, and\n",
      "explained, by the help of my handkerchief displayed, how it was driven\n",
      "forward by the wind.  That upon a quarrel among us, I was set on shore on\n",
      "this coast, where I walked forward, without knowing whither, till he\n",
      "delivered me from the persecution of those execrable _Yahoos_.”  He asked\n",
      "me, “who made the ship, and how it was possible that the _Houyhnhnms_ of\n",
      "my country would leave it to the management of brutes?”  My answer was,\n",
      "“that I durst proceed no further in my relation, unless he would give me\n",
      "his word and honour that he would not be offended, and then I would tell\n",
      "him the wonders I had so often promised.”  He agreed; and I went on by\n",
      "assuring him, that the ship was made by creatures like myself; who, in\n",
      "all the countries I had travelled, as well as in my own, were the only\n",
      "governing rational animals; and that upon my arrival hither, I was as\n",
      "much astonished to see the _Houyhnhnms_ act like rational beings, as he,\n",
      "or his friends, could be, in finding some marks of reason in a creature\n",
      "he was pleased to call a _Yahoo_; to which I owned my resemblance in\n",
      "every part, but could not account for their degenerate and brutal nature.\n",
      "I said farther, “that if good fortune ever restored me to my native\n",
      "country, to relate my travels hither, as I resolved to do, everybody\n",
      "would believe, that I said the thing that was not, that I invented the\n",
      "story out of my own head; and (with all possible respect to himself, his\n",
      "family, and friends, and under his promise of not being offended) our\n",
      "countrymen would hardly think it probable that a _Houyhnhnm_ should be\n",
      "the presiding creature of a nation, and a _Yahoo_ the brute.”\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Houyhnhnm’s notion of truth and falsehood.  The author’s discourse\n",
      "disapproved by his master.  The author gives a more particular account of\n",
      "himself, and the accidents of his voyage.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master heard me with great appearances of uneasiness in his\n",
      "countenance; because doubting, or not believing, are so little known in\n",
      "this country, that the inhabitants cannot tell how to behave themselves\n",
      "under such circumstances.  And I remember, in frequent discourses with my\n",
      "master concerning the nature of manhood in other parts of the world,\n",
      "having occasion to talk of lying and false representation, it was with\n",
      "much difficulty that he comprehended what I meant, although he had\n",
      "otherwise a most acute judgment.  For he argued thus: “that the use of\n",
      "speech was to make us understand one another, and to receive information\n",
      "of facts; now, if any one said the thing which was not, these ends were\n",
      "defeated, because I cannot properly be said to understand him; and I am\n",
      "so far from receiving information, that he leaves me worse than in\n",
      "ignorance; for I am led to believe a thing black, when it is white, and\n",
      "short, when it is long.”  And these were all the notions he had\n",
      "concerning that faculty of lying, so perfectly well understood, and so\n",
      "universally practised, among human creatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "To return from this digression.  When I asserted that the _Yahoos_ were\n",
      "the only governing animals in my country, which my master said was\n",
      "altogether past his conception, he desired to know, “whether we had\n",
      "_Houyhnhnms_ among us, and what was their employment?”  I told him, “we\n",
      "had great numbers; that in summer they grazed in the fields, and in\n",
      "winter were kept in houses with hay and oats, where _Yahoo_ servants were\n",
      "employed to rub their skins smooth, comb their manes, pick their feet,\n",
      "serve them with food, and make their beds.”  “I understand you well,”\n",
      "said my master: “it is now very plain, from all you have spoken, that\n",
      "whatever share of reason the _Yahoos_ pretend to, the _Houyhnhnms_ are\n",
      "your masters; I heartily wish our _Yahoos_ would be so tractable.”  I\n",
      "begged “his honour would please to excuse me from proceeding any further,\n",
      "because I was very certain that the account he expected from me would be\n",
      "highly displeasing.”  But he insisted in commanding me to let him know\n",
      "the best and the worst.  I told him “he should be obeyed.”  I owned “that\n",
      "the _Houyhnhnms_ among us, whom we called horses, were the most generous\n",
      "and comely animals we had; that they excelled in strength and swiftness;\n",
      "and when they belonged to persons of quality, were employed in\n",
      "travelling, racing, or drawing chariots; they were treated with much\n",
      "kindness and care, till they fell into diseases, or became foundered in\n",
      "the feet; but then they were sold, and used to all kind of drudgery till\n",
      "they died; after which their skins were stripped, and sold for what they\n",
      "were worth, and their bodies left to be devoured by dogs and birds of\n",
      "prey.  But the common race of horses had not so good fortune, being kept\n",
      "by farmers and carriers, and other mean people, who put them to greater\n",
      "labour, and fed them worse.”  I described, as well as I could, our way of\n",
      "riding; the shape and use of a bridle, a saddle, a spur, and a whip; of\n",
      "harness and wheels.  I added, “that we fastened plates of a certain hard\n",
      "substance, called iron, at the bottom of their feet, to preserve their\n",
      "hoofs from being broken by the stony ways, on which we often travelled.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My master, after some expressions of great indignation, wondered “how we\n",
      "dared to venture upon a _Houyhnhnm’s_ back; for he was sure, that the\n",
      "weakest servant in his house would be able to shake off the strongest\n",
      "_Yahoo_; or by lying down and rolling on his back, squeeze the brute to\n",
      "death.”  I answered “that our horses were trained up, from three or four\n",
      "years old, to the several uses we intended them for; that if any of them\n",
      "proved intolerably vicious, they were employed for carriages; that they\n",
      "were severely beaten, while they were young, for any mischievous tricks;\n",
      "that the males, designed for the common use of riding or draught, were\n",
      "generally castrated about two years after their birth, to take down their\n",
      "spirits, and make them more tame and gentle; that they were indeed\n",
      "sensible of rewards and punishments; but his honour would please to\n",
      "consider, that they had not the least tincture of reason, any more than\n",
      "the _Yahoos_ in this country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It put me to the pains of many circumlocutions, to give my master a right\n",
      "idea of what I spoke; for their language does not abound in variety of\n",
      "words, because their wants and passions are fewer than among us.  But it\n",
      "is impossible to express his noble resentment at our savage treatment of\n",
      "the _Houyhnhnm_ race; particularly after I had explained the manner and\n",
      "use of castrating horses among us, to hinder them from propagating their\n",
      "kind, and to render them more servile.  He said, “if it were possible\n",
      "there could be any country where _Yahoos_ alone were endued with reason,\n",
      "they certainly must be the governing animal; because reason in time will\n",
      "always prevail against brutal strength.  But, considering the frame of\n",
      "our bodies, and especially of mine, he thought no creature of equal bulk\n",
      "was so ill-contrived for employing that reason in the common offices of\n",
      "life;” whereupon he desired to know “whether those among whom I lived\n",
      "resembled me, or the _Yahoos_ of his country?”  I assured him, “that I\n",
      "was as well shaped as most of my age; but the younger, and the females,\n",
      "were much more soft and tender, and the skins of the latter generally as\n",
      "white as milk.”  He said, “I differed indeed from other _Yahoos_, being\n",
      "much more cleanly, and not altogether so deformed; but, in point of real\n",
      "advantage, he thought I differed for the worse: that my nails were of no\n",
      "use either to my fore or hinder feet; as to my fore feet, he could not\n",
      "properly call them by that name, for he never observed me to walk upon\n",
      "them; that they were too soft to bear the ground; that I generally went\n",
      "with them uncovered; neither was the covering I sometimes wore on them of\n",
      "the same shape, or so strong as that on my feet behind: that I could not\n",
      "walk with any security, for if either of my hinder feet slipped, I must\n",
      "inevitably fail.”  He then began to find fault with other parts of my\n",
      "body: “the flatness of my face, the prominence of my nose, mine eyes\n",
      "placed directly in front, so that I could not look on either side without\n",
      "turning my head: that I was not able to feed myself, without lifting one\n",
      "of my fore-feet to my mouth: and therefore nature had placed those joints\n",
      "to answer that necessity.  He knew not what could be the use of those\n",
      "several clefts and divisions in my feet behind; that these were too soft\n",
      "to bear the hardness and sharpness of stones, without a covering made\n",
      "from the skin of some other brute; that my whole body wanted a fence\n",
      "against heat and cold, which I was forced to put on and off every day,\n",
      "with tediousness and trouble: and lastly, that he observed every animal\n",
      "in this country naturally to abhor the _Yahoos_, whom the weaker avoided,\n",
      "and the stronger drove from them.  So that, supposing us to have the gift\n",
      "of reason, he could not see how it were possible to cure that natural\n",
      "antipathy, which every creature discovered against us; nor consequently\n",
      "how we could tame and render them serviceable.  However, he would,” as he\n",
      "said, “debate the matter no farther, because he was more desirous to know\n",
      "my own story, the country where I was born, and the several actions and\n",
      "events of my life, before I came hither.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I assured him, “how extremely desirous I was that he should be satisfied\n",
      "on every point; but I doubted much, whether it would be possible for me\n",
      "to explain myself on several subjects, whereof his honour could have no\n",
      "conception; because I saw nothing in his country to which I could\n",
      "resemble them; that, however, I would do my best, and strive to express\n",
      "myself by similitudes, humbly desiring his assistance when I wanted\n",
      "proper words;” which he was pleased to promise me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said, “my birth was of honest parents, in an island called England;\n",
      "which was remote from his country, as many days’ journey as the strongest\n",
      "of his honour’s servants could travel in the annual course of the sun;\n",
      "that I was bred a surgeon, whose trade it is to cure wounds and hurts in\n",
      "the body, gotten by accident or violence; that my country was governed by\n",
      "a female man, whom we called queen; that I left it to get riches, whereby\n",

      "I could persuade strangers, out of different countries, to venture with\n",
      "me, after the losses I had sustained, and the hazards I had run?”  I\n",
      "said, “they were fellows of desperate fortunes, forced to fly from the\n",
      "places of their birth on account of their poverty or their crimes.  Some\n",
      "were undone by lawsuits; others spent all they had in drinking, whoring,\n",
      "and gaming; others fled for treason; many for murder, theft, poisoning,\n",
      "robbery, perjury, forgery, coining false money, for committing rapes, or\n",
      "sodomy; for flying from their colours, or deserting to the enemy; and\n",
      "most of them had broken prison; none of these durst return to their\n",
      "native countries, for fear of being hanged, or of starving in a jail; and\n",
      "therefore they were under the necessity of seeking a livelihood in other\n",
      "places.”\n",

      "During this discourse, my master was pleased to interrupt me several\n",
      "times.  I had made use of many circumlocutions in describing to him the\n",
      "nature of the several crimes for which most of our crew had been forced\n",
      "to fly their country.  This labour took up several days’ conversation,\n",
      "before he was able to comprehend me.  He was wholly at a loss to know\n",
      "what could be the use or necessity of practising those vices.  To clear\n",
      "up which, I endeavoured to give some ideas of the desire of power and\n",
      "riches; of the terrible effects of lust, intemperance, malice, and envy.\n",
      "All this I was forced to define and describe by putting cases and making\n",
      "suppositions.  After which, like one whose imagination was struck with\n",
      "something never seen or heard of before, he would lift up his eyes with\n",
      "amazement and indignation.  Power, government, war, law, punishment, and\n",
      "a thousand other things, had no terms wherein that language could express\n",
      "them, which made the difficulty almost insuperable, to give my master any\n",
      "conception of what I meant.  But being of an excellent understanding,\n",
      "much improved by contemplation and converse, he at last arrived at a\n",
      "competent knowledge of what human nature, in our parts of the world, is\n",
      "capable to perform, and desired I would give him some particular account\n",

      "not to be exhausted.  But I shall here only set down the substance of\n",
      "what passed between us concerning my own country, reducing it in order as\n",

      "into by the said prince, and renewed by his successor, the present queen,\n",
      "wherein the greatest powers of Christendom were engaged, and which still\n",
      "continued: I computed, at his request, “that about a million of _Yahoos_\n",
      "might have been killed in the whole progress of it; and perhaps a hundred\n",
      "or more cities taken, and five times as many ships burnt or sunk.”\n",

      "He asked me, “what were the usual causes or motives that made one country\n",
      "go to war with another?”  I answered “they were innumerable; but I should\n",
      "only mention a few of the chief.  Sometimes the ambition of princes, who\n",
      "never think they have land or people enough to govern; sometimes the\n",
      "corruption of ministers, who engage their master in a war, in order to\n",
      "stifle or divert the clamour of the subjects against their evil\n",
      "administration.  Difference in opinions has cost many millions of lives:\n",
      "for instance, whether flesh be bread, or bread be flesh; whether the\n",
      "juice of a certain berry be blood or wine; whether whistling be a vice or\n",
      "a virtue; whether it be better to kiss a post, or throw it into the fire;\n",
      "what is the best colour for a coat, whether black, white, red, or gray;\n",
      "and whether it should be long or short, narrow or wide, dirty or clean;\n",
      "with many more.  Neither are any wars so furious and bloody, or of so\n",

      "“Sometimes the quarrel between two princes is to decide which of them\n",
      "shall dispossess a third of his dominions, where neither of them pretend\n",
      "to any right.  Sometimes one prince quarrels with another for fear the\n",
      "other should quarrel with him.  Sometimes a war is entered upon, because\n",
      "the enemy is too strong; and sometimes, because he is too weak.\n",
      "Sometimes our neighbours want the things which we have, or have the\n",
      "things which we want, and we both fight, till they take ours, or give us\n",
      "theirs.  It is a very justifiable cause of a war, to invade a country\n",
      "after the people have been wasted by famine, destroyed by pestilence, or\n",
      "embroiled by factions among themselves.  It is justifiable to enter into\n",
      "war against our nearest ally, when one of his towns lies convenient for\n",
      "us, or a territory of land, that would render our dominions round and\n",
      "complete.  If a prince sends forces into a nation, where the people are\n",
      "poor and ignorant, he may lawfully put half of them to death, and make\n",
      "slaves of the rest, in order to civilize and reduce them from their\n",

      "practice, when one prince desires the assistance of another, to secure\n",
      "him against an invasion, that the assistant, when he has driven out the\n",
      "invader, should seize on the dominions himself, and kill, imprison, or\n",
      "banish, the prince he came to relieve.  Alliance by blood, or marriage,\n",
      "is a frequent cause of war between princes; and the nearer the kindred\n",
      "is, the greater their disposition to quarrel; poor nations are hungry,\n",
      "and rich nations are proud; and pride and hunger will ever be at\n",
      "variance.  For these reasons, the trade of a soldier is held the most\n",
      "honourable of all others; because a soldier is a _Yahoo_ hired to kill,\n",

      "named, if their strength and cunning equalled their malice.  But as my\n",
      "discourse had increased his abhorrence of the whole species, so he found\n",
      "it gave him a disturbance in his mind to which he was wholly a stranger\n",
      "before.  He thought his ears, being used to such abominable words, might,\n",
      "by degrees, admit them with less detestation: that although he hated the\n",
      "_Yahoos_ of this country, yet he no more blamed them for their odious\n",
      "qualities, than he did a _gnnayh_ (a bird of prey) for its cruelty, or a\n",
      "sharp stone for cutting his hoof.  But when a creature pretending to\n",
      "reason could be capable of such enormities, he dreaded lest the\n",
      "corruption of that faculty might be worse than brutality itself.  He\n",
      "seemed therefore confident, that, instead of reason we were only\n",
      "possessed of some quality fitted to increase our natural vices; as the\n",
      "reflection from a troubled stream returns the image of an ill shapen\n",
      "body, not only larger but more distorted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He added, “that he had heard too much upon the subject of war, both in\n",
      "this and some former discourses.  There was another point, which a little\n",
      "perplexed him at present.  I had informed him, that some of our crew left\n",
      "their country on account of being ruined by law; that I had already\n",
      "explained the meaning of the word; but he was at a loss how it should\n",
      "come to pass, that the law, which was intended for every man’s\n",
      "preservation, should be any man’s ruin.  Therefore he desired to be\n",
      "further satisfied what I meant by law, and the dispensers thereof,\n",
      "according to the present practice in my own country; because he thought\n",
      "nature and reason were sufficient guides for a reasonable animal, as we\n",
      "pretended to be, in showing us what he ought to do, and what to avoid.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I assured his honour, “that the law was a science in which I had not much\n",
      "conversed, further than by employing advocates, in vain, upon some\n",
      "injustices that had been done me: however, I would give him all the\n",
      "satisfaction I was able.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I said, “there was a society of men among us, bred up from their youth in\n",
      "the art of proving, by words multiplied for the purpose, that white is\n",
      "black, and black is white, according as they are paid.  To this society\n",
      "all the rest of the people are slaves.  For example, if my neighbour has\n",
      "a mind to my cow, he has a lawyer to prove that he ought to have my cow\n",
      "from me.  I must then hire another to defend my right, it being against\n",
      "all rules of law that any man should be allowed to speak for himself.\n",
      "Now, in this case, I, who am the right owner, lie under two great\n",
      "disadvantages: first, my lawyer, being practised almost from his cradle\n",
      "in defending falsehood, is quite out of his element when he would be an\n",
      "advocate for justice, which is an unnatural office he always attempts\n",
      "with great awkwardness, if not with ill-will.  The second disadvantage\n",
      "is, that my lawyer must proceed with great caution, or else he will be\n",
      "reprimanded by the judges, and abhorred by his brethren, as one that\n",
      "would lessen the practice of the law.  And therefore I have but two\n",
      "methods to preserve my cow.  The first is, to gain over my adversary’s\n",
      "lawyer with a double fee, who will then betray his client by insinuating\n",
      "that he hath justice on his side.  The second way is for my lawyer to\n",
      "make my cause appear as unjust as he can, by allowing the cow to belong\n",
      "to my adversary: and this, if it be skilfully done, will certainly\n",
      "bespeak the favour of the bench.  Now your honour is to know, that these\n",
      "judges are persons appointed to decide all controversies of property, as\n",
      "well as for the trial of criminals, and picked out from the most\n",
      "dexterous lawyers, who are grown old or lazy; and having been biassed all\n",
      "their lives against truth and equity, lie under such a fatal necessity of\n",
      "favouring fraud, perjury, and oppression, that I have known some of them\n",
      "refuse a large bribe from the side where justice lay, rather than injure\n",
      "the faculty, by doing any thing unbecoming their nature or their office.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a maxim among these lawyers that whatever has been done before,\n",
      "may legally be done again: and therefore they take special care to record\n",
      "all the decisions formerly made against common justice, and the general\n",
      "reason of mankind.  These, under the name of precedents, they produce as\n",
      "authorities to justify the most iniquitous opinions; and the judges never\n",
      "fail of directing accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In pleading, they studiously avoid entering into the merits of the\n",
      "cause; but are loud, violent, and tedious, in dwelling upon all\n",
      "circumstances which are not to the purpose.  For instance, in the case\n",
      "already mentioned; they never desire to know what claim or title my\n",
      "adversary has to my cow; but whether the said cow were red or black; her\n",
      "horns long or short; whether the field I graze her in be round or square;\n",
      "whether she was milked at home or abroad; what diseases she is subject\n",
      "to, and the like; after which they consult precedents, adjourn the cause\n",
      "from time to time, and in ten, twenty, or thirty years, come to an issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is likewise to be observed, that this society has a peculiar cant and\n",
      "jargon of their own, that no other mortal can understand, and wherein all\n",
      "their laws are written, which they take special care to multiply; whereby\n",
      "they have wholly confounded the very essence of truth and falsehood, of\n",
      "right and wrong; so that it will take thirty years to decide, whether the\n",
      "field left me by my ancestors for six generations belongs to me, or to a\n",
      "stranger three hundred miles off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the trial of persons accused for crimes against the state, the method\n",

      "disposition of those in power, after which he can easily hang or save a\n",
      "criminal, strictly preserving all due forms of law.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here my master interposing, said, “it was a pity, that creatures endowed\n",

      "to be instructors of others in wisdom and knowledge.”  In answer to which\n",
      "I assured his honour, “that in all points out of their own trade, they\n",
      "were usually the most ignorant and stupid generation among us, the most\n",

      "My master was yet wholly at a loss to understand what motives could\n",
      "incite this race of lawyers to perplex, disquiet, and weary themselves,\n",
      "and engage in a confederacy of injustice, merely for the sake of injuring\n",
      "their fellow-animals; neither could he comprehend what I meant in saying,\n",

      "the use of money, the materials it was made of, and the value of the\n",
      "metals; “that when a _Yahoo_ had got a great store of this precious\n",
      "substance, he was able to purchase whatever he had a mind to; the finest\n",
      "clothing, the noblest houses, great tracts of land, the most costly meats\n",
      "and drinks, and have his choice of the most beautiful females.  Therefore\n",
      "since money alone was able to perform all these feats, our _Yahoos_\n",
      "thought they could never have enough of it to spend, or to save, as they\n",
      "found themselves inclined, from their natural bent either to profusion or\n",
      "avarice; that the rich man enjoyed the fruit of the poor man’s labour,\n",
      "and the latter were a thousand to one in proportion to the former; that\n",
      "the bulk of our people were forced to live miserably, by labouring every\n",
      "day for small wages, to make a few live plentifully.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I enlarged myself much on these, and many other particulars to the same\n",
      "purpose; but his honour was still to seek; for he went upon a\n",
      "supposition, that all animals had a title to their share in the\n",
      "productions of the earth, and especially those who presided over the\n",
      "rest.  Therefore he desired I would let him know, “what these costly\n",
      "meats were, and how any of us happened to want them?”  Whereupon I\n",
      "enumerated as many sorts as came into my head, with the various methods\n",
      "of dressing them, which could not be done without sending vessels by sea\n",
      "to every part of the world, as well for liquors to drink as for sauces\n",
      "and innumerable other conveniences.  I assured him “that this whole globe\n",
      "of earth must be at least three times gone round before one of our better\n",
      "female _Yahoos_ could get her breakfast, or a cup to put it in.”  He said\n",
      "“that must needs be a miserable country which cannot furnish food for its\n",
      "own inhabitants.  But what he chiefly wondered at was, how such vast\n",
      "tracts of ground as I described should be wholly without fresh water, and\n",
      "the people put to the necessity of sending over the sea for drink.”  I\n",
      "replied “that England (the dear place of my nativity) was computed to\n",
      "produce three times the quantity of food more than its inhabitants are\n",

      "through the natural passage or upwards at the mouth.  Their next business\n",
      "is from herbs, minerals, gums, oils, shells, salts, juices, sea-weed,\n",
      "excrements, barks of trees, serpents, toads, frogs, spiders, dead men’s\n",
      "flesh and bones, birds, beasts, and fishes, to form a composition, for\n",

      "other poisonous additions, they command us to take in at the orifice\n",
      "above or below (just as the physician then happens to be disposed) a\n",
      "medicine equally annoying and disgustful to the bowels; which, relaxing\n",
      "the belly, drives down all before it; and this they call a purge, or a\n",
      "clyster.  For nature (as the physicians allege) having intended the\n",

      "liquids, and the inferior posterior for ejection, these artists\n",
      "ingeniously considering that in all diseases nature is forced out of her\n",
      "seat, therefore, to replace her in it, the body must be treated in a\n",
      "manner directly contrary, by interchanging the use of each orifice;\n",

      "yourself, you are from that day forlorn.  The worst mark you can receive\n",

      "The reader may be disposed to wonder how I could prevail on myself to\n",

      "who are already too apt to conceive the vilest opinion of humankind, from\n",
      "that entire congruity between me and their _Yahoos_.  But I must freely\n",
      "confess, that the many virtues of those excellent quadrupeds, placed in\n",
      "opposite view to human corruptions, had so far opened my eyes and\n",
      "enlarged my understanding, that I began to view the actions and passions\n",
      "of man in a very different light, and to think the honour of my own kind\n",
      "not worth managing; which, besides, it was impossible for me to do,\n",
      "before a person of so acute a judgment as my master, who daily convinced\n",
      "me of a thousand faults in myself, whereof I had not the least perception\n",
      "before, and which, with us, would never be numbered even among human\n",
      "infirmities.  I had likewise learned, from his example, an utter\n",
      "detestation of all falsehood or disguise; and truth appeared so amiable\n",
      "to me, that I determined upon sacrificing every thing to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me deal so candidly with the reader as to confess that there was yet\n",
      "a much stronger motive for the freedom I took in my representation of\n",
      "things.  I had not yet been a year in this country before I contracted\n",
      "such a love and veneration for the inhabitants, that I entered on a firm\n",
      "resolution never to return to humankind, but to pass the rest of my life\n",
      "among these admirable _Houyhnhnms_, in the contemplation and practice of\n",
      "every virtue, where I could have no example or incitement to vice.  But\n",
      "it was decreed by fortune, my perpetual enemy, that so great a felicity\n",
      "should not fall to my share.  However, it is now some comfort to reflect,\n",
      "that in what I said of my countrymen, I extenuated their faults as much\n",
      "as I durst before so strict an examiner; and upon every article gave as\n",
      "favourable a turn as the matter would bear.  For, indeed, who is there\n",
      "alive that will not be swayed by his bias and partiality to the place of\n",
      "his birth?\n",
      "\n",
      "I have related the substance of several conversations I had with my\n",
      "master during the greatest part of the time I had the honour to be in his\n",
      "service; but have, indeed, for brevity sake, omitted much more than is\n",
      "here set down.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I had answered all his questions, and his curiosity seemed to be\n",
      "fully satisfied, he sent for me one morning early, and commanded me to\n",
      "sit down at some distance (an honour which he had never before conferred\n",
      "upon me).  He said, “he had been very seriously considering my whole\n",
      "story, as far as it related both to myself and my country; that he looked\n",
      "upon us as a sort of animals, to whose share, by what accident he could\n",
      "not conjecture, some small pittance of reason had fallen, whereof we made\n",
      "no other use, than by its assistance, to aggravate our natural\n",
      "corruptions, and to acquire new ones, which nature had not given us; that\n",
      "we disarmed ourselves of the few abilities she had bestowed; had been\n",
      "very successful in multiplying our original wants, and seemed to spend\n",
      "our whole lives in vain endeavours to supply them by our own inventions;\n",
      "that, as to myself, it was manifest I had neither the strength nor\n",
      "agility of a common _Yahoo_; that I walked infirmly on my hinder feet;\n",
      "had found out a contrivance to make my claws of no use or defence, and to\n",
      "remove the hair from my chin, which was intended as a shelter from the\n",
      "sun and the weather: lastly, that I could neither run with speed, nor\n",
      "climb trees like my brethren,” as he called them, “the _Yahoos_ in his\n",
      "country.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That our institutions of government and law were plainly owing to our\n",
      "gross defects in reason, and by consequence in virtue; because reason\n",
      "alone is sufficient to govern a rational creature; which was, therefore,\n",
      "a character we had no pretence to challenge, even from the account I had\n",
      "given of my own people; although he manifestly perceived, that, in order\n",
      "to favour them, I had concealed many particulars, and often said the\n",
      "thing which was not.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He was the more confirmed in this opinion, because, he observed, that as\n",
      "I agreed in every feature of my body with other _Yahoos_, except where it\n",
      "was to my real disadvantage in point of strength, speed, and activity,\n",
      "the shortness of my claws, and some other particulars where nature had no\n",
      "part; so from the representation I had given him of our lives, our\n",
      "manners, and our actions, he found as near a resemblance in the\n",
      "disposition of our minds.”  He said, “the _Yahoos_ were known to hate one\n",
      "another, more than they did any different species of animals; and the\n",
      "reason usually assigned was, the odiousness of their own shapes, which\n",
      "all could see in the rest, but not in themselves.  He had therefore begun\n",
      "to think it not unwise in us to cover our bodies, and by that invention\n",
      "conceal many of our deformities from each other, which would else be\n",
      "hardly supportable.  But he now found he had been mistaken, and that the\n",
      "dissensions of those brutes in his country were owing to the same cause\n",
      "with ours, as I had described them.  For if,” said he, “you throw among\n",
      "five _Yahoos_ as much food as would be sufficient for fifty, they will,\n",
      "instead of eating peaceably, fall together by the ears, each single one\n",
      "impatient to have all to itself; and therefore a servant was usually\n",
      "employed to stand by while they were feeding abroad, and those kept at\n",
      "home were tied at a distance from each other: that if a cow died of age\n",
      "or accident, before a _Houyhnhnm_ could secure it for his own _Yahoos_,\n",
      "those in the neighbourhood would come in herds to seize it, and then\n",
      "would ensue such a battle as I had described, with terrible wounds made\n",
      "by their claws on both sides, although they seldom were able to kill one\n",
      "another, for want of such convenient instruments of death as we had\n",
      "invented.  At other times, the like battles have been fought between the\n",
      "_Yahoos_ of several neighbourhoods, without any visible cause; those of\n",
      "one district watching all opportunities to surprise the next, before they\n",
      "are prepared.  But if they find their project has miscarried, they return\n",
      "home, and, for want of enemies, engage in what I call a civil war among\n",
      "themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That in some fields of his country there are certain shining stones of\n",
      "several colours, whereof the _Yahoos_ are violently fond: and when part\n",
      "of these stones is fixed in the earth, as it sometimes happens, they will\n",
      "dig with their claws for whole days to get them out; then carry them\n",
      "away, and hide them by heaps in their kennels; but still looking round\n",
      "with great caution, for fear their comrades should find out their\n",
      "treasure.”  My master said, “he could never discover the reason of this\n",
      "unnatural appetite, or how these stones could be of any use to a _Yahoo_;\n",
      "but now he believed it might proceed from the same principle of avarice\n",
      "which I had ascribed to mankind.  That he had once, by way of experiment,\n",
      "privately removed a heap of these stones from the place where one of his\n",
      "_Yahoos_ had buried it; whereupon the sordid animal, missing his\n",
      "treasure, by his loud lamenting brought the whole herd to the place,\n",
      "there miserably howled, then fell to biting and tearing the rest, began\n",
      "to pine away, would neither eat, nor sleep, nor work, till he ordered a\n",
      "servant privately to convey the stones into the same hole, and hide them\n",
      "as before; which, when his _Yahoo_ had found, he presently recovered his\n",
      "spirits and good humour, but took good care to remove them to a better\n",
      "hiding place, and has ever since been a very serviceable brute.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My master further assured me, which I also observed myself, “that in the\n",
      "fields where the shining stones abound, the fiercest and most frequent\n",
      "battles are fought, occasioned by perpetual inroads of the neighbouring\n",
      "_Yahoos_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He said, “it was common, when two _Yahoos_ discovered such a stone in a\n",
      "field, and were contending which of them should be the proprietor, a\n",
      "third would take the advantage, and carry it away from them both;” which\n",
      "my master would needs contend to have some kind of resemblance with our\n",
      "suits at law; wherein I thought it for our credit not to undeceive him;\n",
      "since the decision he mentioned was much more equitable than many decrees\n",
      "among us; because the plaintiff and defendant there lost nothing beside\n",
      "the stone they contended for: whereas our courts of equity would never\n",
      "have dismissed the cause, while either of them had any thing left.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master, continuing his discourse, said, “there was nothing that\n",
      "rendered the _Yahoos_ more odious, than their undistinguishing appetite\n",
      "to devour every thing that came in their way, whether herbs, roots,\n",
      "berries, the corrupted flesh of animals, or all mingled together: and it\n",
      "was peculiar in their temper, that they were fonder of what they could\n",
      "get by rapine or stealth, at a greater distance, than much better food\n",
      "provided for them at home.  If their prey held out, they would eat till\n",
      "they were ready to burst; after which, nature had pointed out to them a\n",
      "certain root that gave them a general evacuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There was also another kind of root, very juicy, but somewhat rare and\n",
      "difficult to be found, which the _Yahoos_ sought for with much eagerness,\n",
      "and would suck it with great delight; it produced in them the same\n",
      "effects that wine has upon us.  It would make them sometimes hug, and\n",
      "sometimes tear one another; they would howl, and grin, and chatter, and\n",
      "reel, and tumble, and then fall asleep in the mud.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I did indeed observe that the _Yahoos_ were the only animals in this\n",
      "country subject to any diseases; which, however, were much fewer than\n",
      "horses have among us, and contracted, not by any ill-treatment they meet\n",
      "with, but by the nastiness and greediness of that sordid brute.  Neither\n",
      "has their language any more than a general appellation for those\n",
      "maladies, which is borrowed from the name of the beast, and called\n",
      "_hnea-yahoo_, or _Yahoo’s evil_; and the cure prescribed is a mixture of\n",
      "their own dung and urine, forcibly put down the _Yahoo’s_ throat.  This I\n",
      "have since often known to have been taken with success, and do here\n",
      "freely recommend it to my countrymen for the public good, as an admirable\n",
      "specific against all diseases produced by repletion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As to learning, government, arts, manufactures, and the like,” my master\n",
      "confessed, “he could find little or no resemblance between the _Yahoos_\n",
      "of that country and those in ours; for he only meant to observe what\n",
      "parity there was in our natures.  He had heard, indeed, some curious\n",
      "_Houyhnhnms_ observe, that in most herds there was a sort of ruling\n",
      "_Yahoo_ (as among us there is generally some leading or principal stag in\n",
      "a park), who was always more deformed in body, and mischievous in\n",
      "disposition, than any of the rest; that this leader had usually a\n",
      "favourite as like himself as he could get, whose employment was to lick\n",
      "his master’s feet and posteriors, and drive the female _Yahoos_ to his\n",
      "kennel; for which he was now and then rewarded with a piece of ass’s\n",
      "flesh.  This favourite is hated by the whole herd, and therefore, to\n",
      "protect himself, keeps always near the person of his leader.  He usually\n",
      "continues in office till a worse can be found; but the very moment he is\n",
      "discarded, his successor, at the head of all the _Yahoos_ in that\n",
      "district, young and old, male and female, come in a body, and discharge\n",
      "their excrements upon him from head to foot.  But how far this might be\n",
      "applicable to our courts, and favourites, and ministers of state, my\n",
      "master said I could best determine.”\n",

      "the accounts I had given of humankind.”  He said, “those animals, like\n",

      "there were not), which, although it may be a sweeter quadruped than a\n",

      "it was observed that she had a most offensive smell; and when any of the\n",
      "males advanced, would slowly retire, looking often back, and with a\n",

      "perverse, restive disposition; for they are cunning, malicious,\n",
      "treacherous, and revengeful.  They are strong and hardy, but of a\n",
      "cowardly spirit, and, by consequence, insolent, abject, and cruel.  It is\n",

      "reason, and to be wholly governed by it.  Neither is reason among them a\n",
      "point problematical, as with us, where men can argue with plausibility on\n",
      "both sides of the question, but strikes you with immediate conviction; as\n",
      "it must needs do, where it is not mingled, obscured, or discoloured, by\n",

      "proceeds entirely from the dictates of reason.  And I observed my master\n",
      "to show the same affection to his neighbour’s issue, that he had for his\n",

      "One of these grand assemblies was held in my time, about three months\n",
      "before my departure, whither my master went as the representative of our\n",
      "district.  In this council was resumed their old debate, and indeed the\n",
      "only debate that ever happened in their country; whereof my master, after\n",
      "his return, give me a very particular account.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question to be debated was, “whether the _Yahoos_ should be\n",
      "exterminated from the face of the earth?”  One of the members for the\n",
      "affirmative offered several arguments of great strength and weight,\n",
      "alleging, “that as the _Yahoos_ were the most filthy, noisome, and\n",
      "deformed animals which nature ever produced, so they were the most\n",
      "restive and indocible, mischievous and malicious; they would privately\n",
      "suck the teats of the _Houyhnhnms’_ cows, kill and devour their cats,\n",
      "trample down their oats and grass, if they were not continually watched,\n",
      "and commit a thousand other extravagancies.”  He took notice of a general\n",
      "tradition, “that _Yahoos_ had not been always in their country; but that\n",
      "many ages ago, two of these brutes appeared together upon a mountain;\n",
      "whether produced by the heat of the sun upon corrupted mud and slime, or\n",
      "from the ooze and froth of the sea, was never known; that these _Yahoos_\n",
      "engendered, and their brood, in a short time, grew so numerous as to\n",
      "overrun and infest the whole nation; that the _Houyhnhnms_, to get rid of\n",
      "this evil, made a general hunting, and at last enclosed the whole herd;\n",
      "and destroying the elder, every _Houyhnhnm_ kept two young ones in a\n",
      "kennel, and brought them to such a degree of tameness, as an animal, so\n",
      "savage by nature, can be capable of acquiring, using them for draught and\n",
      "carriage; that there seemed to be much truth in this tradition, and that\n",
      "those creatures could not be _yinhniamshy_ (or _aborigines_ of the land),\n",
      "because of the violent hatred the _Houyhnhnms_, as well as all other\n",
      "animals, bore them, which, although their evil disposition sufficiently\n",
      "deserved, could never have arrived at so high a degree if they had been\n",
      "_aborigines_, or else they would have long since been rooted out; that\n",
      "the inhabitants, taking a fancy to use the service of the _Yahoos_, had,\n",
      "very imprudently, neglected to cultivate the breed of asses, which are a\n",
      "comely animal, easily kept, more tame and orderly, without any offensive\n",
      "smell, strong enough for labour, although they yield to the other in\n",
      "agility of body, and if their braying be no agreeable sound, it is far\n",
      "preferable to the horrible howlings of the _Yahoos_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Several others declared their sentiments to the same purpose, when my\n",
      "master proposed an expedient to the assembly, whereof he had indeed\n",
      "borrowed the hint from me.  “He approved of the tradition mentioned by\n",
      "the honourable member who spoke before, and affirmed, that the two\n",
      "_Yahoos_ said to be seen first among them, had been driven thither over\n",
      "the sea; that coming to land, and being forsaken by their companions,\n",
      "they retired to the mountains, and degenerating by degrees, became in\n",
      "process of time much more savage than those of their own species in the\n",
      "country whence these two originals came.  The reason of this assertion\n",
      "was, that he had now in his possession a certain wonderful _Yahoo_\n",
      "(meaning myself) which most of them had heard of, and many of them had\n",
      "seen.  He then related to them how he first found me; that my body was\n",
      "all covered with an artificial composure of the skins and hairs of other\n",
      "animals; that I spoke in a language of my own, and had thoroughly learned\n",
      "theirs; that I had related to him the accidents which brought me thither;\n",
      "that when he saw me without my covering, I was an exact _Yahoo_ in every\n",
      "part, only of a whiter colour, less hairy, and with shorter claws.  He\n",
      "added, how I had endeavoured to persuade him, that in my own and other\n",
      "countries, the _Yahoos_ acted as the governing, rational animal, and held\n",
      "the _Houyhnhnms_ in servitude; that he observed in me all the qualities\n",
      "of a _Yahoo_, only a little more civilized by some tincture of reason,\n",
      "which, however, was in a degree as far inferior to the _Houyhnhnm_ race,\n",
      "as the _Yahoos_ of their country were to me; that, among other things, I\n",
      "mentioned a custom we had of castrating _Houyhnhnms_ when they were\n",

      "justness of their similes, and the minuteness as well as exactness of\n",
      "their descriptions, are indeed inimitable.  Their verses abound very much\n",
      "in both of these, and usually contain either some exalted notions of\n",
      "friendship and benevolence or the praises of those who were victors in\n",
      "races and other bodily exercises.  Their buildings, although very rude\n",
      "and simple, are not inconvenient, but well contrived to defend them from\n",
      "all injuries of cold and heat.  They have a kind of tree, which at forty\n",
      "years old loosens in the root, and falls with the first storm: it grows\n",
      "very straight, and being pointed like stakes with a sharp stone (for the\n",

      "ground, about ten inches asunder, and then weave in oat straw, or\n",

      "The _Houyhnhnms_ use the hollow part, between the pastern and the hoof of\n",
      "their fore-foot, as we do our hands, and this with greater dexterity than\n",
      "I could at first imagine.  I have seen a white mare of our family thread\n",
      "a needle (which I lent her on purpose) with that joint.  They milk their\n",
      "cows, reap their oats, and do all the work which requires hands, in the\n",
      "same manner.  They have a kind of hard flints, which, by grinding against\n",
      "other stones, they form into instruments, that serve instead of wedges,\n",
      "axes, and hammers.  With tools made of these flints, they likewise cut\n",
      "their hay, and reap their oats, which there grow naturally in several\n",

      "tread them in certain covered huts to get out the grain, which is kept in\n",

      "happened that very morning to _shnuwnh_.  The word is strongly expressive\n",
      "in their language, but not easily rendered into English; it signifies,\n",
      "“to retire to his first mother.”  Her excuse for not coming sooner, was,\n",
      "that her husband dying late in the morning, she was a good while\n",
      "consulting her servants about a convenient place where his body should be\n",
      "laid; and I observed, she behaved herself at our house as cheerfully as\n",

      "They live generally to seventy, or seventy-five years, very seldom to\n",
      "fourscore.  Some weeks before their death, they feel a gradual decay; but\n",
      "without pain.  During this time they are much visited by their friends,\n",
      "because they cannot go abroad with their usual ease and satisfaction.\n",
      "However, about ten days before their death, which they seldom fail in\n",
      "computing, they return the visits that have been made them by those who\n",
      "are nearest in the neighbourhood, being carried in a convenient sledge\n",
      "drawn by _Yahoos_; which vehicle they use, not only upon this occasion,\n",
      "but when they grow old, upon long journeys, or when they are lamed by any\n",

      "The author’s economy, and happy life, among the Houyhnhnms.  His great\n",
      "improvement in virtue by conversing with them.  Their conversations.  The\n",
      "author has notice given him by his master, that he must depart from the\n",
      "country.  He falls into a swoon for grief; but submits.  He contrives and\n",
      "finishes a canoe by the help of a fellow-servant, and puts to sea at a\n",

      "\n",
      "I had settled my little economy to my own heart’s content.  My master had\n",
      "ordered a room to be made for me, after their manner, about six yards\n",
      "from the house: the sides and floors of which I plastered with clay, and\n",
      "covered with rush-mats of my own contriving.  I had beaten hemp, which\n",
      "there grows wild, and made of it a sort of ticking; this I filled with\n",
      "the feathers of several birds I had taken with springes made of _Yahoos’_\n",
      "hairs, and were excellent food.  I had worked two chairs with my knife,\n",
      "the sorrel nag helping me in the grosser and more laborious part.  When\n",
      "my clothes were worn to rags, I made myself others with the skins of\n",
      "rabbits, and of a certain beautiful animal, about the same size, called\n",
      "_nnuhnoh_, the skin of which is covered with a fine down.  Of these I\n",
      "also made very tolerable stockings.  I soled my shoes with wood, which I\n",
      "cut from a tree, and fitted to the upper-leather; and when this was worn\n",
      "out, I supplied it with the skins of _Yahoos_ dried in the sun.  I often\n",
      "got honey out of hollow trees, which I mingled with water, or ate with my\n",
      "bread.  No man could more verify the truth of these two maxims, “That\n",
      "nature is very easily satisfied;” and, “That necessity is the mother of\n",
      "invention.”  I enjoyed perfect health of body, and tranquillity of mind;\n",
      "I did not feel the treachery or inconstancy of a friend, nor the injuries\n",
      "of a secret or open enemy.  I had no occasion of bribing, flattering, or\n",
      "pimping, to procure the favour of any great man, or of his minion; I\n",
      "wanted no fence against fraud or oppression: here was neither physician\n",
      "to destroy my body, nor lawyer to ruin my fortune; no informer to watch\n",
      "my words and actions, or forge accusations against me for hire: here were\n",
      "no gibers, censurers, backbiters, pickpockets, highwaymen, housebreakers,\n",

      "useful, expressed in the fewest and most significant words; where, as I\n",
      "have already said, the greatest decency was observed, without the least\n",
      "degree of ceremony; where no person spoke without being pleased himself,\n",
      "and pleasing his companions; where there was no interruption,\n",
      "tediousness, heat, or difference of sentiments.  They have a notion, that\n",
      "when people are met together, a short silence does much improve\n",
      "conversation: this I found to be true; for during those little\n",
      "intermissions of talk, new ideas would arise in their minds, which very\n",
      "much enlivened the discourse.  Their subjects are, generally on\n",
      "friendship and benevolence, on order and economy; sometimes upon the\n",
      "visible operations of nature, or ancient traditions; upon the bounds and\n",
      "limits of virtue; upon the unerring rules of reason, or upon some\n",
      "determinations to be taken at the next great assembly: and often upon the\n",
      "various excellences of poetry.  I may add, without vanity, that my\n",
      "presence often gave them sufficient matter for discourse, because it\n",
      "afforded my master an occasion of letting his friends into the history of\n",
      "me and my country, upon which they were all pleased to descant, in a\n",
      "manner not very advantageous to humankind: and for that reason I shall\n",
      "not repeat what they said; only I may be allowed to observe, that his\n",
      "honour, to my great admiration, appeared to understand the nature of\n",
      "_Yahoos_ much better than myself.  He went through all our vices and\n",
      "follies, and discovered many, which I had never mentioned to him, by only\n",
      "supposing what qualities a _Yahoo_ of their country, with a small\n",
      "proportion of reason, might be capable of exerting; and concluded, with\n",
      "too much probability, “how vile, as well as miserable, such a creature\n",
      "must be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I freely confess, that all the little knowledge I have of any value, was\n",
      "acquired by the lectures I received from my master, and from hearing the\n",
      "discourses of him and his friends; to which I should be prouder to\n",
      "listen, than to dictate to the greatest and wisest assembly in Europe.  I\n",
      "admired the strength, comeliness, and speed of the inhabitants; and such\n",
      "a constellation of virtues, in such amiable persons, produced in me the\n",
      "highest veneration.  At first, indeed, I did not feel that natural awe,\n",
      "which the _Yahoos_ and all other animals bear toward them; but it grew\n",
      "upon me by decrees, much sooner than I imagined, and was mingled with a\n",
      "respectful love and gratitude, that they would condescend to distinguish\n",
      "me from the rest of my species.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I thought of my family, my friends, my countrymen, or the human race\n",
      "in general, I considered them, as they really were, _Yahoos_ in shape and\n",
      "disposition, perhaps a little more civilized, and qualified with the gift\n",
      "of speech; but making no other use of reason, than to improve and\n",
      "multiply those vices whereof their brethren in this country had only the\n",
      "share that nature allotted them.  When I happened to behold the\n",
      "reflection of my own form in a lake or fountain, I turned away my face in\n",
      "horror and detestation of myself, and could better endure the sight of a\n",
      "common _Yahoo_ than of my own person.  By conversing with the\n",
      "_Houyhnhnms_, and looking upon them with delight, I fell to imitate their\n",
      "gait and gesture, which is now grown into a habit; and my friends often\n",
      "tell me, in a blunt way, “that I trot like a horse;” which, however, I\n",
      "take for a great compliment.  Neither shall I disown, that in speaking I\n",
      "am apt to fall into the voice and manner of the _Houyhnhnms_, and hear\n",
      "myself ridiculed on that account, without the least mortification.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the midst of all this happiness, and when I looked upon myself to be\n",
      "fully settled for life, my master sent for me one morning a little\n",
      "earlier than his usual hour.  I observed by his countenance that he was\n",
      "in some perplexity, and at a loss how to begin what he had to speak.\n",
      "After a short silence, he told me, “he did not know how I would take what\n",
      "he was going to say: that in the last general assembly, when the affair\n",
      "of the _Yahoos_ was entered upon, the representatives had taken offence\n",
      "at his keeping a _Yahoo_ (meaning myself) in his family, more like a\n",
      "_Houyhnhnm_ than a brute animal; that he was known frequently to converse\n",
      "with me, as if he could receive some advantage or pleasure in my company;\n",
      "that such a practice was not agreeable to reason or nature, or a thing\n",
      "ever heard of before among them; the assembly did therefore exhort him\n",
      "either to employ me like the rest of my species, or command me to swim\n",
      "back to the place whence I came: that the first of these expedients was\n",
      "utterly rejected by all the _Houyhnhnms_ who had ever seen me at his\n",
      "house or their own; for they alleged, that because I had some rudiments\n",
      "of reason, added to the natural pravity of those animals, it was to be\n",
      "feared I might be able to seduce them into the woody and mountainous\n",
      "parts of the country, and bring them in troops by night to destroy the\n",
      "_Houyhnhnms’_ cattle, as being naturally of the ravenous kind, and averse\n",
      "from labour.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My master added, “that he was daily pressed by the _Houyhnhnms_ of the\n",
      "neighbourhood to have the assembly’s exhortation executed, which he could\n",
      "not put off much longer.  He doubted it would be impossible for me to\n",
      "swim to another country; and therefore wished I would contrive some sort\n",
      "of vehicle, resembling those I had described to him, that might carry me\n",
      "on the sea; in which work I should have the assistance of his own\n",
      "servants, as well as those of his neighbours.”  He concluded, “that for\n",
      "his own part, he could have been content to keep me in his service as\n",
      "long as I lived; because he found I had cured myself of some bad habits\n",
      "and dispositions, by endeavouring, as far as my inferior nature was\n",
      "capable, to imitate the _Houyhnhnms_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I should here observe to the reader, that a decree of the general\n",
      "assembly in this country is expressed by the word _hnhloayn_, which\n",
      "signifies an exhortation, as near as I can render it; for they have no\n",
      "conception how a rational creature can be compelled, but only advised, or\n",
      "exhorted; because no person can disobey reason, without giving up his\n",
      "claim to be a rational creature.\n",

      "I was struck with the utmost grief and despair at my master’s discourse;\n",
      "and being unable to support the agonies I was under, I fell into a swoon\n",
      "at his feet.  When I came to myself, he told me “that he concluded I had\n",
      "been dead;” for these people are subject to no such imbecilities of\n",
      "nature.  I answered in a faint voice, “that death would have been too\n",
      "great a happiness; that although I could not blame the assembly’s\n",
      "exhortation, or the urgency of his friends; yet, in my weak and corrupt\n",
      "judgment, I thought it might consist with reason to have been less\n",
      "rigorous; that I could not swim a league, and probably the nearest land\n",
      "to theirs might be distant above a hundred: that many materials,\n",
      "necessary for making a small vessel to carry me off, were wholly wanting\n",
      "in this country; which, however, I would attempt, in obedience and\n",
      "gratitude to his honour, although I concluded the thing to be impossible,\n",
      "and therefore looked on myself as already devoted to destruction; that\n",
      "the certain prospect of an unnatural death was the least of my evils;\n",
      "for, supposing I should escape with life by some strange adventure, how\n",
      "could I think with temper of passing my days among _Yahoos_, and\n",
      "relapsing into my old corruptions, for want of examples to lead and keep\n",
      "me within the paths of virtue? that I knew too well upon what solid\n",
      "reasons all the determinations of the wise _Houyhnhnms_ were founded, not\n",

      "after presenting him with my humble thanks for the offer of his servants’\n",
      "assistance in making a vessel, and desiring a reasonable time for so\n",
      "difficult a work, I told him I would endeavour to preserve a wretched\n",

      "My master, in a few words, made me a very gracious reply; allowed me the\n",

      "fellow-servant (for so, at this distance, I may presume to call him), to\n",

      "\n",
      "In his company, my first business was to go to that part of the coast\n",

      "island toward the north-east.  I took out my pocket glass, and could then\n",
      "clearly distinguish it above five leagues off, as I computed; but it\n",
      "appeared to the sorrel nag to be only a blue cloud: for as he had no\n",

      "fastened very artificially after their manner, to a wooden handle, cut\n",
      "down several oak wattles, about the thickness of a walking-staff, and\n",
      "some larger pieces.  But I shall not trouble the reader with a particular\n",
      "description of my own mechanics; let it suffice to say, that in six weeks\n",
      "time with the help of the sorrel nag, who performed the parts that\n",

      "older being too tough and thick; and I likewise provided myself with four\n",

      "I began this desperate voyage on February 15, 1714–15, at nine o’clock in\n",
      "the morning.  The wind was very favourable; however, I made use at first\n",
      "only of my paddles; but considering I should soon be weary, and that the\n",
      "wind might chop about, I ventured to set up my little sail; and thus,\n",
      "with the help of the tide, I went at the rate of a league and a half an\n",
      "hour, as near as I could guess.  My master and his friends continued on\n",
      "the shore till I was almost out of sight; and I often heard the sorrel\n",
      "nag (who always loved me) crying out, “_Hnuy illa nyha_, _majah Yahoo_;”\n",
      "“Take care of thyself, gentle _Yahoo_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My design was, if possible, to discover some small island uninhabited,\n",
      "yet sufficient, by my labour, to furnish me with the necessaries of life,\n",
      "which I would have thought a greater happiness, than to be first minister\n",
      "in the politest court of Europe; so horrible was the idea I conceived of\n",
      "returning to live in the society, and under the government of _Yahoos_.\n",
      "For in such a solitude as I desired, I could at least enjoy my own\n",
      "thoughts, and reflect with delight on the virtues of those inimitable\n",
      "_Houyhnhnms_, without an opportunity of degenerating into the vices and\n",
      "corruptions of my own species.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reader may remember what I related, when my crew conspired against\n",
      "me, and confined me to my cabin; how I continued there several weeks\n",
      "without knowing what course we took; and when I was put ashore in the\n",
      "long-boat, how the sailors told me, with oaths, whether true or false,\n",
      "“that they knew not in what part of the world we were.”  However, I did\n",
      "then believe us to be about 10 degrees southward of the Cape of Good\n",
      "Hope, or about 45 degrees southern latitude, as I gathered from some\n",
      "general words I overheard among them, being I supposed to the south-east\n",
      "in their intended voyage to Madagascar.  And although this were little\n",
      "better than conjecture, yet I resolved to steer my course eastward,\n",
      "hoping to reach the south-west coast of New Holland, and perhaps some\n",
      "such island as I desired lying westward of it.  The wind was full west,\n",
      "and by six in the evening I computed I had gone eastward at least\n",
      "eighteen leagues; when I spied a very small island about half a league\n",
      "off, which I soon reached.  It was nothing but a rock, with one creek\n",
      "naturally arched by the force of tempests.  Here I put in my canoe, and\n",
      "climbing a part of the rock, I could plainly discover land to the east,\n",
      "extending from south to north.  I lay all night in my canoe; and\n",
      "repeating my voyage early in the morning, I arrived in seven hours to the\n",
      "south-east point of New Holland.  This confirmed me in the opinion I have\n",
      "long entertained, that the maps and charts place this country at least\n",
      "three degrees more to the east than it really is; which thought I\n",
      "communicated many years ago to my worthy friend, Mr. Herman Moll, and\n",
      "gave him my reasons for it, although he has rather chosen to follow other\n",
      "authors.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw no inhabitants in the place where I landed, and being unarmed, I\n",
      "was afraid of venturing far into the country.  I found some shellfish on\n",
      "the shore, and ate them raw, not daring to kindle a fire, for fear of\n",
      "being discovered by the natives.  I continued three days feeding on\n",
      "oysters and limpets, to save my own provisions; and I fortunately found a\n",
      "brook of excellent water, which gave me great relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the fourth day, venturing out early a little too far, I saw twenty or\n",
      "thirty natives upon a height not above five hundred yards from me.  They\n",
      "were stark naked, men, women, and children, round a fire, as I could\n",
      "discover by the smoke.  One of them spied me, and gave notice to the\n",
      "rest; five of them advanced toward me, leaving the women and children at\n",
      "the fire.  I made what haste I could to the shore, and, getting into my\n",
      "canoe, shoved off: the savages, observing me retreat, ran after me: and\n",
      "before I could get far enough into the sea, discharged an arrow which\n",
      "wounded me deeply on the inside of my left knee: I shall carry the mark\n",
      "to my grave.  I apprehended the arrow might be poisoned, and paddling out\n",
      "of the reach of their darts (being a calm day), I made a shift to suck\n",
      "the wound, and dress it as well as I could.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was at a loss what to do, for I durst not return to the same\n",
      "landing-place, but stood to the north, and was forced to paddle, for the\n",
      "wind, though very gentle, was against me, blowing north-west.  As I was\n",
      "looking about for a secure landing-place, I saw a sail to the\n",
      "north-north-east, which appearing every minute more visible, I was in\n",
      "some doubt whether I should wait for them or not; but at last my\n",
      "detestation of the _Yahoo_ race prevailed: and turning my canoe, I sailed\n",
      "and paddled together to the south, and got into the same creek whence I\n",
      "set out in the morning, choosing rather to trust myself among these\n",
      "barbarians, than live with European _Yahoos_.  I drew up my canoe as\n",
      "close as I could to the shore, and hid myself behind a stone by the\n",
      "little brook, which, as I have already said, was excellent water.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ship came within half a league of this creek, and sent her long boat\n",
      "with vessels to take in fresh water (for the place, it seems, was very\n",
      "well known); but I did not observe it, till the boat was almost on shore;\n",
      "and it was too late to seek another hiding-place.  The seamen at their\n",
      "landing observed my canoe, and rummaging it all over, easily conjectured\n",
      "that the owner could not be far off.  Four of them, well armed, searched\n",
      "every cranny and lurking-hole, till at last they found me flat on my face\n",
      "behind the stone.  They gazed awhile in admiration at my strange uncouth\n",
      "dress; my coat made of skins, my wooden-soled shoes, and my furred\n",
      "stockings; whence, however, they concluded, I was not a native of the\n",
      "place, who all go naked.  One of the seamen, in Portuguese, bid me rise,\n",
      "and asked who I was.  I understood that language very well, and getting\n",
      "upon my feet, said, “I was a poor _Yahoo_ banished from the _Houyhnhnms_,\n",
      "and desired they would please to let me depart.”  They admired to hear me\n",
      "answer them in their own tongue, and saw by my complexion I must be a\n",
      "European; but were at a loss to know what I meant by _Yahoos_ and\n",
      "_Houyhnhnms_; and at the same time fell a-laughing at my strange tone in\n",
      "speaking, which resembled the neighing of a horse.  I trembled all the\n",
      "while betwixt fear and hatred.  I again desired leave to depart, and was\n",
      "gently moving to my canoe; but they laid hold of me, desiring to know,\n",
      "“what country I was of? whence I came?” with many other questions.  I\n",
      "told them “I was born in England, whence I came about five years ago, and\n",
      "then their country and ours were at peace.  I therefore hoped they would\n",
      "not treat me as an enemy, since I meant them no harm, but was a poor\n",
      "_Yahoo_ seeking some desolate place where to pass the remainder of his\n",
      "unfortunate life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When they began to talk, I thought I never heard or saw any thing more\n",
      "unnatural; for it appeared to me as monstrous as if a dog or a cow should\n",
      "speak in England, or a _Yahoo_ in _Houyhnhnmland_.  The honest Portuguese\n",
      "were equally amazed at my strange dress, and the odd manner of delivering\n",
      "my words, which, however, they understood very well.  They spoke to me\n",
      "with great humanity, and said, “they were sure the captain would carry me\n",
      "_gratis_ to Lisbon, whence I might return to my own country; that two of\n",
      "the seamen would go back to the ship, inform the captain of what they had\n",
      "seen, and receive his orders; in the mean time, unless I would give my\n",
      "solemn oath not to fly, they would secure me by force.  I thought it best\n",
      "to comply with their proposal.  They were very curious to know my story,\n",
      "but I gave them very little satisfaction, and they all conjectured that\n",
      "my misfortunes had impaired my reason.  In two hours the boat, which went\n",
      "laden with vessels of water, returned, with the captain’s command to\n",
      "fetch me on board.  I fell on my knees to preserve my liberty; but all\n",
      "was in vain; and the men, having tied me with cords, heaved me into the\n",
      "boat, whence I was taken into the ship, and thence into the captain’s\n",
      "cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "His name was Pedro de Mendez; he was a very courteous and generous\n",
      "person.  He entreated me to give some account of myself, and desired to\n",
      "know what I would eat or drink; said, “I should be used as well as\n",
      "himself;” and spoke so many obliging things, that I wondered to find such\n",
      "civilities from a _Yahoo_.  However, I remained silent and sullen; I was\n",
      "ready to faint at the very smell of him and his men.  At last I desired\n",
      "something to eat out of my own canoe; but he ordered me a chicken, and\n",
      "some excellent wine, and then directed that I should be put to bed in a\n",
      "very clean cabin.  I would not undress myself, but lay on the\n",
      "bed-clothes, and in half an hour stole out, when I thought the crew was\n",
      "at dinner, and getting to the side of the ship, was going to leap into\n",
      "the sea, and swim for my life, rather than continue among _Yahoos_.  But\n",
      "one of the seamen prevented me, and having informed the captain, I was\n",
      "chained to my cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "After dinner, Don Pedro came to me, and desired to know my reason for so\n",
      "desperate an attempt; assured me, “he only meant to do me all the service\n",
      "he was able;” and spoke so very movingly, that at last I descended to\n",
      "treat him like an animal which had some little portion of reason.  I gave\n",
      "him a very short relation of my voyage; of the conspiracy against me by\n",
      "my own men; of the country where they set me on shore, and of my five\n",
      "years residence there.  All which he looked upon as if it were a dream or\n",
      "a vision; whereat I took great offence; for I had quite forgot the\n",
      "faculty of lying, so peculiar to _Yahoos_, in all countries where they\n",
      "preside, and, consequently, their disposition of suspecting truth in\n",
      "others of their own species.  I asked him, “whether it were the custom in\n",
      "his country to say the thing which was not?”  I assured him, “I had\n",
      "almost forgot what he meant by falsehood, and if I had lived a thousand\n",
      "years in _Houyhnhnmland_, I should never have heard a lie from the\n",
      "meanest servant; that I was altogether indifferent whether he believed me\n",
      "or not; but, however, in return for his favours, I would give so much\n",
      "allowance to the corruption of his nature, as to answer any objection he\n",
      "would please to make, and then he might easily discover the truth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The captain, a wise man, after many endeavours to catch me tripping in\n",
      "some part of my story, at last began to have a better opinion of my\n",
      "veracity.  But he added, “that since I professed so inviolable an\n",
      "attachment to truth, I must give him my word and honour to bear him\n",
      "company in this voyage, without attempting any thing against my life; or\n",
      "else he would continue me a prisoner till we arrived at Lisbon.”  I gave\n",
      "him the promise he required; but at the same time protested, “that I\n",
      "would suffer the greatest hardships, rather than return to live among\n",
      "_Yahoos_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Our voyage passed without any considerable accident.  In gratitude to the\n",
      "captain, I sometimes sat with him, at his earnest request, and strove to\n",
      "conceal my antipathy against human kind, although it often broke out;\n",
      "which he suffered to pass without observation.  But the greatest part of\n",
      "the day I confined myself to my cabin, to avoid seeing any of the crew.\n",
      "The captain had often entreated me to strip myself of my savage dress,\n",
      "and offered to lend me the best suit of clothes he had.  This I would not\n",
      "be prevailed on to accept, abhorring to cover myself with any thing that\n",
      "had been on the back of a _Yahoo_.  I only desired he would lend me two\n",
      "clean shirts, which, having been washed since he wore them, I believed\n",
      "would not so much defile me.  These I changed every second day, and\n",
      "washed them myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "We arrived at Lisbon, Nov. 5, 1715.  At our landing, the captain forced\n",
      "me to cover myself with his cloak, to prevent the rabble from crowding\n",
      "about me.  I was conveyed to his own house; and at my earnest request he\n",
      "led me up to the highest room backwards.  I conjured him “to conceal from\n",
      "all persons what I had told him of the _Houyhnhnms_; because the least\n",
      "hint of such a story would not only draw numbers of people to see me, but\n",
      "probably put me in danger of being imprisoned, or burnt by the\n",
      "Inquisition.”  The captain persuaded me to accept a suit of clothes newly\n",
      "made; but I would not suffer the tailor to take my measure; however, Don\n",
      "Pedro being almost of my size, they fitted me well enough.  He accoutred\n",
      "me with other necessaries, all new, which I aired for twenty-four hours\n",
      "before I would use them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The captain had no wife, nor above three servants, none of which were\n",
      "suffered to attend at meals; and his whole deportment was so obliging,\n",
      "added to very good human understanding, that I really began to tolerate\n",
      "his company.  He gained so far upon me, that I ventured to look out of\n",
      "the back window.  By degrees I was brought into another room, whence I\n",
      "peeped into the street, but drew my head back in a fright.  In a week’s\n",
      "time he seduced me down to the door.  I found my terror gradually\n",
      "lessened, but my hatred and contempt seemed to increase.  I was at last\n",
      "bold enough to walk the street in his company, but kept my nose well\n",
      "stopped with rue, or sometimes with tobacco.\n",
      "\n",
      "In ten days, Don Pedro, to whom I had given some account of my domestic\n",
      "affairs, put it upon me, as a matter of honour and conscience, “that I\n",
      "ought to return to my native country, and live at home with my wife and\n",
      "children.”  He told me, “there was an English ship in the port just ready\n",
      "to sail, and he would furnish me with all things necessary.”  It would be\n",
      "tedious to repeat his arguments, and my contradictions.  He said, “it was\n",
      "altogether impossible to find such a solitary island as I desired to live\n",
      "in; but I might command in my own house, and pass my time in a manner as\n",
      "recluse as I pleased.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I complied at last, finding I could not do better.  I left Lisbon the\n",
      "24th day of November, in an English merchantman, but who was the master I\n",
      "never inquired.  Don Pedro accompanied me to the ship, and lent me twenty\n",
      "pounds.  He took kind leave of me, and embraced me at parting, which I\n",
      "bore as well as I could.  During this last voyage I had no commerce with\n",
      "the master or any of his men; but, pretending I was sick, kept close in\n",
      "my cabin.  On the fifth of December, 1715, we cast anchor in the Downs,\n",
      "about nine in the morning, and at three in the afternoon I got safe to my\n",
      "house at Rotherhith. {546}\n",

      "My wife and family received me with great surprise and joy, because they\n",
      "concluded me certainly dead; but I must freely confess the sight of them\n",
      "filled me only with hatred, disgust, and contempt; and the more, by\n",
      "reflecting on the near alliance I had to them.  For although, since my\n",
      "unfortunate exile from the _Houyhnhnm_ country, I had compelled myself to\n",
      "tolerate the sight of _Yahoos_, and to converse with Don Pedro de Mendez,\n",
      "yet my memory and imagination were perpetually filled with the virtues\n",
      "and ideas of those exalted _Houyhnhnms_.  And when I began to consider\n",
      "that, by copulating with one of the _Yahoo_ species I had become a parent\n",
      "of more, it struck me with the utmost shame, confusion, and horror.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as I entered the house, my wife took me in her arms, and kissed\n",
      "me; at which, having not been used to the touch of that odious animal for\n",
      "so many years, I fell into a swoon for almost an hour.  At the time I am\n",
      "writing, it is five years since my last return to England.  During the\n",
      "first year, I could not endure my wife or children in my presence; the\n",
      "very smell of them was intolerable; much less could I suffer them to eat\n",
      "in the same room.  To this hour they dare not presume to touch my bread,\n",
      "or drink out of the same cup, neither was I ever able to let one of them\n",
      "take me by the hand.  The first money I laid out was to buy two young\n",
      "stone-horses, which I keep in a good stable; and next to them, the groom\n",
      "is my greatest favourite, for I feel my spirits revived by the smell he\n",
      "contracts in the stable.  My horses understand me tolerably well; I\n",
      "converse with them at least four hours every day.  They are strangers to\n",
